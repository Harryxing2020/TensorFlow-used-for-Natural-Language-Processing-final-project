430,2020-10-20,<JoeBiden>," waving a white flag and saying, “it is what it is” is unacceptable when thousands are dying each week, when businesses are closing, and when schools remain shuttered. the american people have never backed down from a challenge, but they need a leader to show the way.

450,2020-10-18,<JoeBiden>," we are in a battle for the soul of the nation.   the forces of darkness, the forces of division, the forces of yesterday are pulling us apart, holding us down, and holding us back.  we must free ourselves of all of them.

455,2020-10-18,<JoeBiden>," covid-19 cases are on the rise across the nation.  but instead of leading by example, donald trump continues to put others in danger with his campaign events that ignore expert-recommended precautions.  every day he proves just how unfit he is to lead america through this crisis.

461,2020-10-17,<JoeBiden>," a job is about a lot more than a paycheck.  it's about dignity. it's about respect. it's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything will be okay.  too many people today can't do that — and it's got to change.
"

463,2020-10-17,<JoeBiden>," in the middle of a pandemic, president trump is trying to eliminate obamacare and increase health care costs for millions.  now, he’s rushing through a u.s. supreme court justice to help him get it done. it’s unconscionable.   make no mistake: health care is on the ballot.
"
464,2020-10-17,<JoeBiden>," if we do our part, if we stand together, if we keep faith with the past and with each other — then the divisions of our time can give way to the dreams of a brighter, better future.   that is our work. that is our pledge. that is our mission.
"
465,2020-10-17,<JoeBiden>," this election is bigger than any one candidate.   it's about the future of our economy, our health care, our climate, our commitment to racial justice, our democracy –– and so much more.  we have to vote.  "

476,2020-10-16,<JoeBiden>," not only does president trump refuse to grant temporary protected status to venezuelans, but he also apparently used stealth deportations to send them back to the oppressive maduro regime.  it’s abundantly clear he has no regard for the suffering of the venezuelan people.

702,2020-09-30,<JoeBiden>," i took the amtrak from wilmington to washington, d.c., every day for 36 years. the journey became routine, but the hardworking men and women i met along the way became dear friends.  "
703,2020-09-30,<JoeBiden>," enough with the racist dog whistles, donald. you wouldn’t know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn.

713,2020-09-29,<JoeBiden>, you determine the outcome of this election. vote. vote. vote.  
714,2020-09-29,<JoeBiden>," under this president, we have become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided, and more violent.   when i was vice president, we inherited a recession, i was asked to fix it, and i did.  we left donald trump a booming economy, and he caused a recession.  "
715,2020-09-29,<JoeBiden>," under this president, we’ve become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided, and more violent.

720,2020-09-29,<JoeBiden>," on average, roughly 750 to 1,000 americans are dying from covid every day.  when donald trump was presented with that number, he said, “it is what it is.”  it is what it is because donald trump is who he is.  "

722,2020-09-29,<JoeBiden>," donald trump is the worst president we've ever had.
"
723,2020-09-29,<JoeBiden>," when i hear 200,000 deaths, i think of the empty chairs at dining room tables all across the country, which just months ago were filled by loved ones.  it didn’t have to be this bad.
"
724,2020-09-29,<JoeBiden>," it is what it is because donald trump is who he is.
"
725,2020-09-29,<JoeBiden>, the american people deserve to have a say in who the supreme court nominee is.  
726,2020-09-29,<JoeBiden>," president trump keeps promising to protect americans with pre-existing conditions, but the truth is he’s in court trying to rip their protections away.  and now, he’s trying to jam through the confirmation of a justice who will help him get it done.  we can’t let him win.

"
735,2020-09-29,<JoeBiden>," with casualties rapidly mounting in and around nagorno-karabakh, the trump administration needs to call the leaders of armenia and azerbaijan immediately to de-escalate the situation. it must also demand others — like turkey — stay out of this conflict.  "
736,2020-09-29,<JoeBiden>," the american people understand the urgency of this moment. they're voting in droves because their health care hangs in the balance.  but donald trump doesn't care — he sees a chance to eliminate obamacare and rip away health care protections from millions.  it's unconscionable.
"
737,2020-09-28,<JoeBiden>," i believe there's no greater economic engine in the world than the hard work and ingenuity of the american people — and i witnessed it firsthand last week in manitowoc, wisconsin.  together, we're going to make sure the future is made here in america.  "

744,2020-09-28,<JoeBiden>," here's the deal: until we deal with covid-19, we'll never get our economy fully back on track, get our kids safely back to school, or get our lives back.  it's why as president, i won't waste a day getting this virus under control.  "
745,2020-09-28,<JoeBiden>," there's no mystery when it comes to what's happening with the supreme court. president trump and republicans have been trying to throw out obamacare for years — and now they see an opening to get it done.  we can't let them get away with it.

"
752,2020-09-26,<JoeBiden>," in the middle of a pandemic, donald trump is trying to force through the confirmation of a justice who will help him destroy obamacare.  health care is at stake. protections for pre-existing conditions are at stake.  we can't let them win.  "
753,2020-09-26,<JoeBiden>," the senate shouldn't vote until the american people do.
"
754,2020-09-26,<JoeBiden>," supreme court decisions affect our everyday lives, and the constitution was designed to give voters a voice on who makes those decisions.  the senate shouldn't act until after the american people select their next president and the next congress.  americans deserve to be heard.
"
755,2020-09-26,<JoeBiden>," today, president trump nominated judge amy coney barrett to the supreme court — a jurist with a written track record of disagreeing with the court’s decision to uphold the affordable care act.  vote like your health care is on the ballot — because it is.  "
756,2020-09-26,<JoeBiden>," when ebola hit, president obama and i took swift action and successfully contained the virus.  after covid-19 hit, president trump lied to the american people and said it would miraculously ""disappear.""  now, over 200,000 lives have been cut short.  it's a national tragedy.
"
757,2020-09-26,<JoeBiden>," at this moment, we're facing both the worst public health crisis of our lifetime and the existential threat of climate change.  we need a president who believes in science.
"

762,2020-09-25,<JoeBiden>," the unrelenting impact of climate change affects every single one of us.  it requires action, not denial. it requires leadership, not scapegoating.  it requires a president to meet the threshold duty of the office — to care, for everyone.
"
763,2020-09-25,<JoeBiden>, we are in the middle of a climate emergency — and every day that donald trump remains in the white house further threatens the future of our planet.  we have to vote him out.  
764,2020-09-25,<JoeBiden>," obamacare was—and is—a big deal. as president, i’ll protect and build on it, lower health care costs, and give americans the opportunity to choose a new public option.  we’re going to make sure everyone has access to the affordable health care they need.  "

767,2020-09-25,<JoeBiden>," thank you,  your support and your friendship mean the world to me. john and i didn't always agree on the issues, but we put aside our differences to find common ground and move the country forward — it's what i'll do every day as president.  "
768,2020-09-24,<JoeBiden>," i've spent my career working to end violence against women and will fight to end the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. i applaud congress for passing savanna's act this week.  now, the senate and president trump need to reauthorize vawa. it's long overdue.
"
769,2020-09-24,<JoeBiden>," once again, we are called to ask ourselves whether justice could be equally applied in america. but what's clear is that today in america, black women deserve better.
"
770,2020-09-24,<JoeBiden>," the trump administration says ""the entire aca must fall.""  they are arguing to strip millions of americans of health care in the middle of a pandemic.  we can't let him win.  "
771,2020-09-24,<JoeBiden>," in-person early voting should be easy and convenient for all. the flint, mi city clerk's office will be open the last three weekends before election day for folks to cast their ballots. it's an example that cities and states across the country should follow.

777,2020-09-23,<JoeBiden>," even amidst the profound grief &amp; anger today's decision generated, violence is never &amp; can never be the answer. those who engage in it must be held accountable. jill &amp; i are keeping the officers shot tonight in louisville in our prayers. we wish them both a swift &amp; full recovery.
"
778,2020-09-23,<JoeBiden>," the 200,000 people we've lost to covid-19 weren't nobodies, mr. president.  they were our parents and grandparents, sons and daughters, friends and co-workers.  they were americans.  "
779,2020-09-23,<JoeBiden>," as juan guaidó speaks about the venezuelan humanitarian crisis and the crimes against humanity perpetrated by maduro, i reaffirm my commitment to stand with the venezuelan people.  a biden-harris administration will always champion democracy and human rights around the world.

783,2020-09-23,<JoeBiden>, this is our moment to tackle systemic racism head-on and build a nation true to our founding ideals. a nation where all men and women are not only created equal — but treated equally.   here's how we'll advance racial economic equity:  
784,2020-09-23,<JoeBiden>, i’ve dealt with guys like donald trump my whole life.  guys who look down on you because they’ve got a lot of money.  guys who think they’re better than you.  guys who inherited everything they ever got in life — and then squandered it.

789,2020-09-22,<JoeBiden>," let me be very clear,  not a single one of the 200,000 americans we've lost to this virus was a ""nobody.""  "
790,2020-09-22,<JoeBiden>," the last four years come down to the next 42 days. this is our moment — and if you vote, we’ll win.  head to  "
791,2020-09-22,<JoeBiden>," donald trump sees the world from park avenue.  i see the world from where i grew up: scranton, pennsylvania.

793,2020-09-22,<JoeBiden>," 200,000 americans have died from this virus.  it’s a staggering number that’s hard to wrap your head around. but behind every covid-19 death is a family and community that will never again be the same.  there’s a devastating human toll to this pandemic — and we can’t forget that.
"
794,2020-09-22,<JoeBiden>," while other nations worked around the clock to get this virus under control, our president was too busy tweeting and golfing.  now, nearly 200,000 americans have died.  it didn’t have to happen this way.  "

"
796,2020-09-21,<JoeBiden>," donald trump ran for office saying he would represent the forgotten men and women of this country — and as soon as he got in office, he forgot about us.
"
797,2020-09-21,<JoeBiden>," when the virus came, president trump wasn’t thinking about you, he was thinking about his own reelection.  it’s how trump looks at the world: it’s always about him, never about us.  you deserve a president who will put you first.
"
798,2020-09-21,<JoeBiden>," thank you for the warm welcome, manitowoc! with the help of companies like wisconsin aluminum foundry, we're going to revitalize american manufacturing and make sure the future is made here in america.  "

800,2020-09-21,<JoeBiden>," if this reporting is true, this complaint is deeply concerning and needs to be independently investigated immediately. these women are entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. practices like this would end in a biden administration.  "
801,2020-09-20,<JoeBiden>, let me be clear: lgbtq+ rights are human rights — and “lgbt-free zones” have no place in the european union or anywhere in the world.

824,2020-09-18,<JoeBiden>," when we needed donald trump to tell the truth about covid-19, he lied to us.  when we needed him to take action to contain its spread, he spent his days golfing.  when we needed a president the most, he was nowhere to be found.  it's unforgivable.
"
825,2020-09-18,<JoeBiden>," donald trump claimed he would be ""the greatest jobs president god ever created.""  but the fact is he's the worst jobs president in recorded history.  we can't afford another four years of his failed leadership.  "
826,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>," folks, i just wrapped up my first cnn town hall of the general election. we’re in the home stretch of this campaign and your support matters more than ever.  chip in to help us keep tonight’s momentum going:  "
827,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>, what the hell makes you think i need an ivy league degree to be president? #bidentownhall  
828,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>," unlike president trump, i’ll be a president for all americans — not just the ones who vote for me. #bidentownhall  "
829,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>," here's the deal: i've condemned every form of violence, no matter what the source is. president trump has not. #bidentownhall  "
830,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>," as president, i will bring americans together and finally deliver much needed policing reform. #bidentownhall  "
831,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>, you lost your freedom because president trump didn't act. #bidentownhall  
832,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>, i’m in this race to fight for the hardworking americans who wake up every single day and make our country run. #bidentownhall  
833,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>," i'll tell you what takes away your freedom: not being able to see your kid, go to the football game, or see your mom or dad in the hospital. that's what is costing us our freedom. #bidentownhall  "
834,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>, the choice in this election couldn’t be more clear.  we can choose four more years of donald trump’s dark and divisive politics.  or we can choose a path of hope and light—and build a better future for all.  chip in to help us win. #bidentownhall  
835,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>," this election is scranton vs. park avenue.
"
836,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>, president trump knew how deadly covid-19 was and did nothing. it’s close to criminal. #bidentownhall  
837,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>," i’m about to take the stage for tonight’s town hall in scranton, pennsylvania. tune in to  now to watch live.  "
838,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>," donald trump wants to give his rich friends another tax cut, so they pay a lower tax rate than tens of millions of essential workers and middle class americans.  we need a president who cares about more than the wealthy and well-connected.
"
839,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>," i’m looking forward to being back in my home town of scranton, pennsylvania, for tonight’s cnn town hall. tune in at 8 pm et to watch.  "
840,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>," no surprise, donald trump is lying about my tax plan. here’s the truth about how i’ll make corporations pay their fair share while ensuring americans making under $400,000 don’t pay a penny more.  "
841,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>," ahead of #roshhashanah, jill and i want to wish everyone in the jewish community a very happy, healthy, and sweet new year. tune in to our virtual event:  "
842,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>," the 100 richest americans have made more than $300 billion during the covid-19 crisis.   now, in the middle of a pandemic and economic crisis, donald trump wants to give them a $29 billion tax break.   let that sink in.
"
843,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>," if you make under $400,000, you will not pay a penny more in taxes when i'm president.  the super-wealthy and big corporations will finally pay their fair share — and we'll invest that money in working families.  we're going to reward work — not wealth.
"
844,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>," . the job is to be president of all americans. for the love of god start acting like it.
"
845,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>," we've had to endure president trump's incompetence and dishonesty when it comes to testing, wearing masks, and socially distancing.    we can't afford a repeat of those fiascos with a covid-19 vaccine.  the stakes are too high.
"
846,2020-09-17,<JoeBiden>," yesterday, i met with some of our nation's top experts to discuss how we distribute a safe and effective covid-19 vaccine. if i win this election, i know that there won't be a minute to waste. i'll get to work on day one implementing an effective distribution plan.  "
847,2020-09-16,<JoeBiden>," president trump promised the opioid crisis would end ""quickly"" if he won, but the fact is drug overdose deaths are up nearly 10% across the country. it's heartbreaking.  as president, i promise i'll take action to end this epidemic.  "
848,2020-09-16,<JoeBiden>," if you give a climate arsonist four more years in the white house, why would anyone be surprised if more of america is ablaze?  "
849,2020-09-16,<JoeBiden>," we’re going to get this virus under control and get your life back on track.
"
850,2020-09-16,<JoeBiden>, this is donald trump’s america after one term. why would we give him a second?  
851,2020-09-16,<JoeBiden>," when i said i trust vaccines, and i trust the scientists, but i don't trust donald trump — this is what i meant:
"
852,2020-09-16,<JoeBiden>," we can’t allow the good friday agreement that brought peace to northern ireland to become a casualty of brexit.  any trade deal between the u.s. and u.k. must be contingent upon respect for the agreement and preventing the return of a hard border. period.
"
853,2020-09-16,<JoeBiden>," we all want a covid-19 vaccine as soon as possible, but it needs to be based on science — not politics. tune in as i discuss how we can develop and equitably distribute a safe and effective vaccine:  "
854,2020-09-16,<JoeBiden>," we’ve lost nearly 200,000 americans to covid-19.   it didn’t have to be this bad — but donald trump failed to do his job.
"
855,2020-09-16,<JoeBiden>, the fact of the matter is donald trump doesn't have a health care plan.  i do — and you can read it here:  
856,2020-09-16,<JoeBiden>," donald trump’s climate denial may not have directly caused the record fires we’re seeing on the west coast. but if he gets four more years in the white house, they’ll only become more common, devastating, and deadly.  "
857,2020-09-15,<JoeBiden>," to be clear: i am not currently president. but if you chip in now, we can change that in november:  "
858,2020-09-15,<JoeBiden>," hispanic heritage month is a reminder of the strength we draw as a nation from our immigrant roots. no matter where your family came from, we're here because we all share the same ideals. that's the story of america — and it is well worth celebrating.  "
859,2020-09-15,<JoeBiden>," donald trump not only suggested we sell or trade puerto rico — but he also left our fellow americans without the resources they desperately needed after hurricane maria. it's unacceptable.  as president, i'll support the island's full recovery and invest in its people and future.
"
860,2020-09-15,<JoeBiden>, today marks the official start of hispanic heritage month. tune in as we kick off our celebration from florida:  
861,2020-09-15,<JoeBiden>," as we celebrate the independence day of costa rica, guatemala, el salvador, honduras and nicaragua, we must affirm the democratic aspirations and human rights of people across latin america.  i'll always fight for democracy and for those who come to america seeking a better life.
"
862,2020-09-15,<JoeBiden>," the 16th street baptist church bombing is a powerful reminder of our past and what remains at stake in this election. as we honor the memory of those four little girls, we must commit to defeating the poisonous ideology of white supremacy that lit the fuse 57 years ago.
"
863,2020-09-15,<JoeBiden>," i believe that every american deserves a fair shot to get ahead and a government that treats them equally. but that hasn't been the case for the people of puerto rico. today, i'm releasing my new plan to change that:  "
864,2020-09-15,<JoeBiden>," for months, president trump has failed to provide desperately needed fiscal relief to our state and local governments — and we’re seeing the consequences every day.  our students and educators deserve better.  as president, i’ll make sure they always have the resources they need.
"
865,2020-09-15,<JoeBiden>," the most sacred obligation of our government is to do right by those who defend our nation at war. i’m in tampa, florida, to hear from veterans and to discuss how i’ll honor that promise as president. tune in:  "
866,2020-09-15,<JoeBiden>," donald trump is not responsible for covid-19, but he is responsible for his failed response and for lying to the american people.  "
867,2020-09-15,<JoeBiden>," this morning, parents all across the west — already worried about their kids being indoors because of covid-19 — are now also waking up worried about their kids being outside.  we need a president who takes climate change seriously.
"
868,2020-09-14,<JoeBiden>," the fact is, iran is closer to a nuclear bomb today than it was when donald trump took office.  every day he’s in charge of our national security is another day our enemies are emboldened and the american people are at risk.  "
869,2020-09-14,<JoeBiden>," when donald trump thinks about climate change, he thinks “hoax.”   i think “jobs.”  good paying, union jobs that put americans to work building a stronger, more climate-resilient nation.  "
870,2020-09-14,<JoeBiden>," . you know what’s actually threatening our suburbs?  wildfires. floods. hurricanes.  we need to act on climate. now.
"
871,2020-09-14,<JoeBiden>," folks, it all comes down to this. we have just 50 days until the most important election of our lifetimes.  make a plan to have your voice heard this november.  "
872,2020-09-14,<JoeBiden>, amy poehler and  know a thing or two about  and  — and i can't wait to see what they have in store for tonight's grassroots fundraiser.  chip in now to reserve your ticket:  
873,2020-09-14,<JoeBiden>, climate change is the existential challenge that will define our future as a country. tune in as i discuss the wildfires up and down the west coast — and how i'll tackle the climate crisis head-on and create millions of good-paying jobs:  
874,2020-09-14,<JoeBiden>, 50 days until election day. 50 days to do everything we can to make donald trump a one-term president.  chip in to power our campaign through this final stretch:  
875,2020-09-13,<JoeBiden>," weapons of war have no place in our communities.  we need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
"
876,2020-09-13,<JoeBiden>," when president trump talks about america leading the world, this is what he means.  "
877,2020-09-13,<JoeBiden>, i know we can beat donald trump and build this nation back better — but we need your help to do it. that's why we're launching our new grassroots fundraising team.  sign up and help us win this november.  
878,2020-09-13,<JoeBiden>," i promise that as president, i’ll make reauthorizing the violence against women act a top priority and continue working to end gender-based violence.  "
879,2020-09-13,<JoeBiden>," with each reauthorization, vawa has become stronger.  the latest bill—passed by the house last year—would close loopholes allowing abusers to obtain guns and extend protections for native women.  but mitch mcconnell refuses to bring it to the floor for a vote. it’s despicable.
"
880,2020-09-13,<JoeBiden>," 26 years ago today, the violence against women act became law. in the years since, it has saved countless lives and helped change the culture around sexual assault and domestic violence.  writing and championing the law remains one of my proudest accomplishments.  "
881,2020-09-13,<JoeBiden>," it's hard to believe, but monday marks 50 days until election day. to kick off the final stretch,  and  are hosting a grassroots fundraiser.  you won't want to miss this, folks. chip in to reserve your spot:  "
882,2020-09-13,<JoeBiden>," 26 years ago today, the senate passed 10-year bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines—it was an effort i was proud to champion.  these bans saved lives, and congress should have never let them expire.  as president, i’ll take on the  and we’ll ban them once again.
"
883,2020-09-13,<JoeBiden>," this cold-blooded shooting is unconscionable and the perpetrator must be brought to justice.  violence of any kind is wrong; those who commit it should be caught and punished.  jill and i are keeping the deputies and their loved ones in our hearts and praying for a full recovery.
"
884,2020-09-12,<JoeBiden>," in a biden-harris administration, “buy american” will be more than a slogan.   we’re going to invest an additional $400 billion in purchasing american-made products and keep good-paying jobs here at home.  "
885,2020-09-12,<JoeBiden>, donald trump and i have pretty different philosophies when it comes to giving our word.   mine means something.   when i tell the american people i’m going to do something — i follow through.  
886,2020-09-12,<JoeBiden>," i promise you that if i’m elected president, i’ll never forget what the job is about. it’s about you — the american people.  "
887,2020-09-12,<JoeBiden>," iran’s cruel execution of navid afkari is a travesty. no country should arrest, torture, or execute peaceful protestors or activists.   iran must free its other political prisoners, including nasrin sotoudeh, and release unjustly detained americans.
"
888,2020-09-12,<JoeBiden>," as president, i’ll impose a tax penalty on companies that ship jobs overseas and sell products back to the u.s. — and i’ll create millions of good-paying jobs here at home.  we’re going to make sure the future is made in america — by all of america's workers.  "
889,2020-09-12,<JoeBiden>," the science is clear, and deadly signs like the fires out west are unmistakable — climate change poses an existential threat to our way of life.  we must act now to avoid a future defined by tragedies like the one american families are enduring today.  "
890,2020-09-12,<JoeBiden>," you deserve a president and vice president who will spend every minute of every day working to make your life better.  i promise that’s exactly what  and i will do.
"
891,2020-09-11,<JoeBiden>," and now, as then, we owe it to them to come together as a nation — so that americans can once again do what we did so bravely nineteen years ago: turn from tragedy to purpose, rebuild our lives, and begin, in time, to heal.
"
892,2020-09-11,<JoeBiden>," now, as then, our heroes are ordinary people doing extraordinary things: nurses and doctors; delivery drivers and grocery clerks; public transit workers and educators; regular americans thrust into courageous acts of sacrifice and service.
"
893,2020-09-11,<JoeBiden>," this year, we mark the anniversary of 9/11 in the midst of another crisis that compels us to summon the best of the american people in the face of unconscionable, inconceivable loss — a crisis that has already taken nearly 200,000 americans.
"
894,2020-09-11,<JoeBiden>," nineteen years ago, our nation was tested by an unspeakable act of cowardice and hate. nearly 3,000 lives were cut short: a once-unthinkable toll which tore open the hearts of americans in every corner of the country.  "
895,2020-09-11,<JoeBiden>," as a nation, we must never forget those we lost on 9/11 and the incredible bravery of our first responders. though the wounds of that day will never fully heal, the spirit of americans recovered as it always does — unbowed by the efforts of those who strike against it.  "
896,2020-09-10,<JoeBiden>," donald trump said he wanted to be a cheerleader for the country. we didn't need a cheerleader. we needed a president.
"
897,2020-09-10,<JoeBiden>," more than 1,000 people died from covid yesterday.   watched eight hours of tv.  if i’m president, you might not always agree with me. but i promise you i will always show up and fight for you.  "
898,2020-09-10,<JoeBiden>," donald trump is holding a rally in michigan today—while also refusing to fully fund their national guard.  these are frontline workers against covid-19, responsible for testing and distributing food and medical supplies.  michiganders need a pandemic response—not a pep rally.
"
899,2020-09-10,<JoeBiden>, do your part. wear a mask.  
900,2020-09-10,<JoeBiden>, make no mistake: climate change is already here — and we’re witnessing its devastating effects every single day.   we have to get president trump out of the white house and treat this crisis like the existential threat that it is.  
901,2020-09-10,<JoeBiden>," to everyone struggling right now, i want you to know that you are not alone. you’re seen, you’re heard, and you’re loved.   if you need help, please don’t hesitate to visit  "
902,2020-09-10,<JoeBiden>," the images coming out of california, oregon, washington, and other western states are truly horrifying. if you’re in an impacted area, please heed the warnings from your local authorities and stay safe. jill and i are keeping you all in our prayers.
"
903,2020-09-10,<JoeBiden>, how many more people have to suffer because of president trump's lies?  
904,2020-09-10,<JoeBiden>," donald trump said he didn't want to tell the truth and create a panic. so he did nothing and created a disaster.
"
905,2020-09-10,<JoeBiden>," i got to meet lou brock back in march. i joked that i had really just come to st. louis to see him—and let me tell you, our meeting was a real highlight. lou was a true legend and a man of integrity. jill and i are keeping his loved ones in our prayers during this difficult time.  "
906,2020-09-09,<JoeBiden>," donald trump knew that covid-19 was dangerous. he knew it was deadly. and he purposely downplayed it.  now, nearly 200,000 americans are dead.  it’s unconscionable.  "
907,2020-09-09,<JoeBiden>," you deserve a president who tells you the truth.
"
908,2020-09-09,<JoeBiden>," if donald trump had acted just two weeks earlier, 54,000 lives could have been spared in march and april alone.   instead, he downplayed the threat and refused to take action — costing lives and sending our economy into a tailspin.  it’s an unjustifiable dereliction of duty.
"
909,2020-09-09,<JoeBiden>," roberto clemente was an incredible baseball player. he was a barrier breaker and a humanitarian. as he rose to fame, he lifted the black and latino communities with him.  i may be a phillies fan, but i’m always proud to honor the legacy of #21.  "
910,2020-09-09,<JoeBiden>," i promise you that if i’m elected, i’ll always tell you the truth.  i’ll listen to the experts and do everything i can to contain this virus.  and i’ll always put your health and safety first — no matter the political cost.
"
911,2020-09-09,<JoeBiden>," donald trump knew.  he lied to us for months.  and while a deadly disease ripped through our nation, he failed to do his job — on purpose.  it was a life or death betrayal of the american people.
"
912,2020-09-09,<JoeBiden>," i’m in warren, michigan, to discuss how a biden-harris administration will ensure the future is made in america — by america’s workers. tune in now:  "
913,2020-09-09,<JoeBiden>, the right to vote is the most sacred american right there is — exercise it.   make your voice heard this november.  
914,2020-09-09,<JoeBiden>, president obama and i rescued the auto industry and helped michigan's economy come roaring back.  donald trump squandered it — and hardworking michiganders are paying the price every day.  
915,2020-09-08,<JoeBiden>," given his track record, no one can take trump’s word alone on a covid-19 vaccine. but with satisfactory answers to these questions, every american can have confidence in a safe and effective covid-19 vaccine.  "
916,2020-09-08,<JoeBiden>," 3: what is the plan to allocate and distribute vaccines to americans cost-free, safely, equitably, and without politics?   president trump should release a detailed distribution plan to ensure every american — not just the wealthy and well-connected — receives the vaccine.
"
917,2020-09-08,<JoeBiden>," 2: who will validate that the administration’s decision to greenlight a covid-19 vaccine is driven by science and not political motivation?   we must hear uncensored statements on efficacy and safety from  the  vaccine advisory committee, and dr. fauci.
"
918,2020-09-08,<JoeBiden>," 1: what criteria will be used to ensure a vaccine meets the scientific standard of safety and efficacy?  the fda must clarify what criteria it will use, and president trump must commit to respecting the independent judgment of the non-political professional staff at the fda.
"
919,2020-09-08,<JoeBiden>," a safe and effective covid-19 vaccine could save countless lives. we need one as soon as possible.  but while i see a vaccine as a product of science, president trump sees it as a political tool.  politics should play no role in this. the administration must answer the following:
"
920,2020-09-08,<JoeBiden>," donald trump is incapable of providing the leadership this moment requires.
"
921,2020-09-08,<JoeBiden>," every single american worker deserves the chance to join a union. as president, i’ll strengthen our labor unions and ensure workers can bargain for the pay, benefits, and workplace protections they deserve.  "
922,2020-09-08,<JoeBiden>," i can tell you few people know me as well as  and  do.
"
923,2020-09-08,<JoeBiden>," just months ago, donald trump was planning to allow oil and gas drilling off the coast of florida.   now, with 56 days until the election, he conveniently says that he changed his mind. unbelievable.   you don't have to guess where i stand: i oppose new offshore drilling.
"
924,2020-09-08,<JoeBiden>," on this feast day of cuba’s patron saint la virgen de la caridad del cobre, jill and i pray that the love and compassion “cachita” inspires will fill the hearts of cubans and believers around the world.  "
925,2020-09-08,<JoeBiden>," unlike donald trump, i'll listen to the experts and heed their advice — especially when it comes to matters of health and safety.  you should expect nothing less from your president.  "
926,2020-09-08,<JoeBiden>," this economy may be working great for donald trump and his wealthy friends — but it's not working for the rest of america.  it's time we change that.
"
927,2020-09-08,<JoeBiden>," at our best, america has always been generous, kind, and optimistic. we treat each other with dignity, give hate no safe harbor, and leave no one behind.  i believe we can be that nation once again.
"
928,2020-09-07,<JoeBiden>," mr. president — if you’re so good at making deals, then why does your trade deal cost american workers so much pain while letting china off the hook for its biggest trade abuses?  "
929,2020-09-07,<JoeBiden>," as president, i’ll make record investments in american industry and create millions of good-paying, union jobs.  we’re going to make sure the future is made in america — and built by union workers.  "
930,2020-09-07,<JoeBiden>," wall street didn't build this country — the middle class did. and unions built the middle class.  donald trump doesn't understand that. we need a president who does.
"
931,2020-09-07,<JoeBiden>," it's not enough to just thank our essential workers — we need to pay them. as president, i’ll:  - raise the minimum wage to $15 - end the tipped minimum wage - end the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities - ensure everyone has strong benefits
"
932,2020-09-07,<JoeBiden>," for years, president trump and republicans have waged a war on america's labor unions.   it will end on my watch.  i'll sign the pro act — making it easier for workers to organize and collectively bargain — and be the strongest labor president workers have ever had.
"
933,2020-09-07,<JoeBiden>," together, we can build a future that reflects working people’s courage and ambition. one that not only offers good jobs — but the dignity, equity, shared prosperity, and common purpose due to every american.  "
934,2020-09-07,<JoeBiden>," the 40-hour workweek minimum wage overtime pay health care  workplace safety protections  they’re all because of unions — and it’s time we recognize that.
"
935,2020-09-07,<JoeBiden>," today, we honor the generations of union workers who fought for the rights, power, wages, and benefits that built and sustained the great american middle class. #laborday  "
936,2020-09-06,<JoeBiden>," we need to restore honor and decency to the white house.
"
937,2020-09-06,<JoeBiden>," time and again, the president has refused to provide puerto rico with much-needed resources. he’s repeatedly insulted puerto ricans and this latest action is another example of his disrespect for the island.   this ends when i’m elected president.
"
938,2020-09-06,<JoeBiden>," donald trump promised to be ""the greatest jobs president god ever created.""  but in reality, he's on track to become the first president in modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when he entered.  american workers can't take four more years of his failed leadership.
"
939,2020-09-06,<JoeBiden>, we all want our schools to reopen — but we need to do it in a way that puts the health and safety of our students and educators first.  here's how  and i will reopen our schools safely and effectively:  
940,2020-09-06,<JoeBiden>, we know what president trump thinks of our nation's veterans. here is what they think of him.  
941,2020-09-06,<JoeBiden>," it’s time we reward work — not just wealth.
"
942,2020-09-06,<JoeBiden>, be a patriot. wear a mask.  
943,2020-09-05,<JoeBiden>, the economy wasn’t working for folks long before this virus hit. that’s why  and i won’t just build back to the way things were — we’re going to build back better.  we’re going to make sure everyone has a fair shot to get ahead.  
944,2020-09-05,<JoeBiden>," as president, i will:  - call for nationwide mask mandates - implement widespread testing - accelerate the development of treatments and vaccines  i’m ready to work on day one to contain the spread of this virus and get our country back on track.
"
945,2020-09-05,<JoeBiden>," nicaraguan asylum seekers fleeing oppression deserve to have their cases heard. instead, they’re being deported back into the tyrannical grip of daniel ortega without a chance to pursue their claims.  president trump’s cruelty truly knows no bounds.
"
946,2020-09-05,<JoeBiden>," mr. president, enough with the weekend golf trips and erratic tweets. it's time for you to get to work and control the spread of this virus.
"

"
997,2020-08-31,<JoeBiden>," donald trump may believe mouthing the words law and order makes him strong, but his failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia in this country shows you how weak he is.

1005,2020-08-30,<JoeBiden>," donald trump has been president for almost four years.  the temperature in the country is higher, tensions run stronger, divisions run deeper.  and all of us are less safe because he can’t do the job of the american president.
"
1006,2020-08-30,<JoeBiden>," we must not become a country at war with ourselves.  a country that accepts the killing of fellow americans who do not agree with you. a country that vows vengeance toward one another.  but that is the america that president trump wants us to be, the america he believes we are.

1025,2020-08-28,<JoeBiden>," mr. president, americans are canceling weddings and holding funerals without family. they're sacrificing so more americans don't have to die.  but instead of leading by example, you hosted a super spreader event on the south lawn.  when will you take the presidency seriously?
"
1026,2020-08-28,<JoeBiden>," we can't let george floyd and jacob blake become just another pair of hashtags.  this is a moment of action.  it's long past time we reform policing, reverse systemic racism, and make our communities safer.

"
1032,2020-08-27,<JoeBiden>," from the moment covid-19 emerged, president trump downplayed the threat it posed, refused to listen to the experts, and failed to take action to contain its spread.  now, we’re paying the price.
"
1033,2020-08-27,<JoeBiden>," donald trump promised to be the greatest jobs president god ever created.  instead, tens of millions of americans are out of work and we're facing the worst economic crisis since the great depression. #promisesbroken  "

1036,2020-08-27,<JoeBiden>," donald trump calls himself a wartime president. but now, instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he’s waved the white flag.  he abandoned the american people when we needed him most.

1202,2020-08-14,<JoeBiden>," voting by mail is safe and secure. and don't take my word for it: take it from the president, who just requested his mail-in ballot for the florida primary on tuesday.
"
1203,2020-08-14,<JoeBiden>," today marks 85 years since the social security act was signed into law, providing protection for the most vulnerable. now we’re living in a moment where we must strengthen our commitment to social security — not defund it.
"
1204,2020-08-14,<JoeBiden>, the choice we make this november will decide the future of america.  i have no doubt  is the right partner to join me to lead our nation through this moment.  
1205,2020-08-13,<JoeBiden>," . is going to stand with me in this campaign — and all of us are going to stand up for her.  together, we're going to make history.  "
1206,2020-08-13,<JoeBiden>," there’s no better partner than  to help me beat donald trump, but we can’t do it without your help.  chip in today to help us win in november:  "
1207,2020-08-13,<JoeBiden>, the hard truth is black women still only get paid 62 cents for every dollar white men make. it's unacceptable.  my administration will work to close the pay gap for black women and create an economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work. #blackwomensequalpayday  
1208,2020-08-13,<JoeBiden>, i know  will work every single day to make life better for all americans and build this nation back better than before.  
1209,2020-08-13,<JoeBiden>," i first met  through my son beau. they grew close while fighting to take on the big banks — and he had enormous respect for her and her work.  there is no one’s opinion i valued more than beau’s, and i’m proud to have kamala standing with me on this campaign.
"
1210,2020-08-13,<JoeBiden>," . and i are keeping the people of iowa and everyone impacted by monday's derecho in our prayers. we've got to make sure iowans and those across the midwest get the relief they need for a quick and full recovery.
"
1211,2020-08-13,<JoeBiden>," when i was making my decision, i knew i needed someone who’s ready to help lead the nation on day one.   is that person.  "
1212,2020-08-13,<JoeBiden>," we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. and if we're going to get through these crises — we need to come together and unite for a better america.   gets that — and i believe there's no better person to help me get the job done.
"
1213,2020-08-12,<JoeBiden>," when i called  yesterday to ask her to be my running mate, i wanted to make sure jill and doug got to say hello.   you’re honorary bidens now!  "
1214,2020-08-12,<JoeBiden>," heather heyer was a brave young woman who saw what was happening in her hometown of charlottesville and decided to fight against it.   let us honor her memory by continuing to stand against hate.
"
1215,2020-08-12,<JoeBiden>," three years ago today, white supremacists descended on charlottesville with torches in hand and hate in their hearts. our president said they were ""very fine people.""   it was clear then, and it's clear now: we are in a battle for the soul of our nation, and we must win.
"
1216,2020-08-12,<JoeBiden>," one of the reasons i chose  is because we both believe you can define america in one simple word — possibilities.
"
1217,2020-08-12,<JoeBiden>," if you’re worried about whether you’ll have a job, worried about the poisons in the air you breathe and water you drink, worried about your civil rights or even your basic dignity being under attack— has had your back. now, we have to have hers.
"
1218,2020-08-12,<JoeBiden>," working families need someone on their side...because they certainly don’t have anyone on their side with this president.   that’s going to change in the biden-harris administration.
"
1219,2020-08-12,<JoeBiden>," this morning, little girls woke up across this nation — especially black and brown girls who so often may feel overlooked and undervalued in our society — potentially seeing themselves in a new way: as the stuff of presidents and vice presidents.
"
1220,2020-08-12,<JoeBiden>," we’ve all watched  in the senate go toe-to-toe with trump officials trying to hide the truth, asking the tough questions that need to be asked — and not stopping until she gets an answer. she’s ready to do this job.
"
1221,2020-08-12,<JoeBiden>," this afternoon,  and i will be speaking together for the first time since yesterday’s big announcement. tune in:  "
1222,2020-08-12,<JoeBiden>," whether it's taking on the big banks or pushing for marriage equality—kamala never shies away from fighting tooth and nail for what's right. it's why i chose her to be my running mate.  she'll wake up every day thinking about how to make life better for the people of our country.
"
1223,2020-08-12,<JoeBiden>," as the daughter of jamaican and indian immigrants,  grew up believing in the promise of america because she saw it firsthand.  together, kamala and i are going to fight every single day in the white house to make sure that promise is fulfilled for all americans.
"
1224,2020-08-12,<JoeBiden>," if  and i are elected, we’re going to inherit multiple crises, a nation divided, and a world in disarray. we won’t have a minute to waste.   that's exactly why i picked her: she's ready to lead on day one.
"
1225,2020-08-12,<JoeBiden>, . is the daughter of proud immigrants—a mother from india and a father from jamaica—who raised her to take action. that’s exactly what this moment calls for: action. and we hope you’ll take action with us:  
1226,2020-08-12,<JoeBiden>," right now, america faces:    - the worst pandemic in 100 years - the worst economic crisis since the great depression - the most powerful calls for racial justice in a generation   i need someone alongside me who's smart, tough, and ready to lead.  is that person.
"
1227,2020-08-11,<JoeBiden>," thanks to supporters like you, we are on track to have our biggest fundraising day ever. together, we can win this.  join us.  "
1228,2020-08-11,<JoeBiden>," back when kamala was attorney general, she worked closely with beau. i watched as they took on the big banks, lifted up working people, and protected women and kids from abuse. i was proud then, and i'm proud now to have her as my partner in this campaign.
"
1229,2020-08-11,<JoeBiden>," i have the great honor to announce that i’ve picked  — a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country’s finest public servants — as my running mate.
"
1230,2020-08-11,<JoeBiden>," don't forget that in the middle of this pandemic, the trump administration is in court trying to eliminate obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. it's heartless.  i'll protect and build on the aca to ensure everyone gets the care they need.  "
1231,2020-08-11,<JoeBiden>," i promise you if i'm elected, i won't waste any time getting this virus under control.  i'll call dr. fauci and ask him to stay on. i'll bring together top experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.  we'll get it done, together.
"
1232,2020-08-10,<JoeBiden>," this is the latest dire consequence of donald trump looking the other way on beijing's repression in hong kong. instead of standing for freedom and democracy, he consistently stands with xi jinping.  i'll put american values back at the center of our foreign policy.
"
1233,2020-08-10,<JoeBiden>," social security is the bedrock of american retirement — giving countless americans peace of mind and the ability to retire with dignity. i've been fighting to protect and expand the program throughout my career — and i'll continue that fight as president.
"
1234,2020-08-10,<JoeBiden>," folks, we need to listen to our frontline heroes. wear a mask. it’s not just about you. it’s about keeping your family, neighbors, and fellow citizens safe.  "
1235,2020-08-10,<JoeBiden>, bristol bay is no place for a mine — our administration decided that in 2014. we're only discussing it today because donald trump's epa reversed course hours after a closed-door meeting with the mining company's ceo.  
1236,2020-08-10,<JoeBiden>," donald trump said that if he’s re-elected, he’ll defund social security.  we can't let that happen.
"
1237,2020-08-10,<JoeBiden>," president trump keeps attacking the u.s. postal service, and now hundreds of thousands of veterans aren't getting their life-saving medications on time. it's despicable.  i promise you that as president, i will never put politics over the care of our nation's veterans.
"
1238,2020-08-10,<JoeBiden>," donald trump’s surrender to the pandemic has led to a resurgence of the virus and more economic pain and anxiety for millions of americans.   after six months of a nation in crisis, he still has no plan to get us through. but i do:  "
1239,2020-08-10,<JoeBiden>," to the millions of americans struggling to get by right now — those who can't find a job or pay the bills: i want you to know that i see you, and i won't forget you — and i'm going to fight every day in the white house to build an economy that works for you.
"
1240,2020-08-09,<JoeBiden>," every single eligible american should have the opportunity to vote-by-mail this november. if it's good enough for donald trump — then it's good enough for you and me.
"
1241,2020-08-09,<JoeBiden>," we can’t let donald trump destroy the u.s. postal service.
"
1242,2020-08-09,<JoeBiden>," it's been six years since michael brown's life was taken in ferguson — reigniting a movement. we must continue the work of tackling systemic racism and reforming policing.
"
1243,2020-08-09,<JoeBiden>," our planet can’t take four more years of donald trump. we have to get him out of the white house so we can start treating the climate crisis like the urgent threat it is.
"
1244,2020-08-09,<JoeBiden>," giving the trump administration another four years in office would have catastrophic implications for future generations. his victory would threaten the future of our democracy, and we must vote him out this november.  "
1245,2020-08-08,<JoeBiden>," the united states just passed 5 million reported infections of covid-19. it’s a number that boggles the mind and breaks the heart. each time the number goes up, it represents a life altered, a family stricken with anxiety, a community on edge. it shouldn’t have gotten this bad.
"
1246,2020-08-08,<JoeBiden>," today, donald trump stated that if re-elected, he'll undermine the entire financial footing of social security.  our seniors and millions of americans with disabilities are under enough stress without their hard-earned social security benefits in doubt.  "
1247,2020-08-08,<JoeBiden>," donald trump has refused to take serious action to combat the covid-19 crisis. and as a result, he got what he’s always wanted — the u.s. isolated from the rest of the world.  "
1248,2020-08-08,<JoeBiden>," it’s an important choice, and i want you to be one of the first to know who i’ve picked as my running mate – text first to 30330 to get notified when i’ve made my decision.
"
1249,2020-08-08,<JoeBiden>," between the coronavirus and the economic crisis, this is a tough time for our country, i know. but i firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. together, we will climb out of these crises and emerge stronger than before.
"
1250,2020-08-08,<JoeBiden>," the fact is, donald trump left our nation unprepared and unprotected for the worst public health crisis of our lifetime — and we're paying the price every single day.  "
1251,2020-08-08,<JoeBiden>," our nation is desperate for leadership — leadership that can unite us and steer us through these crises. but at the most critical moment of his presidency, donald trump has nothing to offer.
"
1252,2020-08-08,<JoeBiden>," no president can promise to prevent future outbreaks. but i'll promise you this: when i'm president we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better.
"
1253,2020-08-08,<JoeBiden>," john lewis will be remembered as a moral giant who dedicated his life to creating a more just, equal, and moral america.  donald trump will not.  "
1254,2020-08-07,<JoeBiden>," i can’t believe i have to say this, but we can’t let donald trump open up the grand canyon for uranium mining.
"
1255,2020-08-07,<JoeBiden>," i believe every american deserves a fair shot at success — not just the mar-a-lago crowd. that’s why as president, i’ll reverse donald trump’s giant tax giveaways to the super-wealthy and big corporations, and build an economy that works for everyone.
"
1256,2020-08-07,<JoeBiden>, it didn't have to be this bad.  
1257,2020-08-07,<JoeBiden>," here’s the truth—donald trump turned his back on the middle class long before covid-19. he cut taxes for the super-wealthy, drove u.s. manufacturing into a recession, and stacked the deck against hardworking americans.  it's time we pick a different path.  "
1258,2020-08-07,<JoeBiden>, make no mistake: this economic crisis is due to president trump’s failure to get this virus under control.  
1259,2020-08-07,<JoeBiden>," while i am grateful for the people who got their jobs back, my heart goes out to the more than 16 million americans still out of work. the truth is it didn't have to be this bad, but donald trump failed to act. he's the one person who should lose his job.  "
1260,2020-08-07,<JoeBiden>, the truth is that president trump could have acted months ago to curb this pandemic—it's obvious he still hasn’t learned his lesson. he continues to ignore the warnings of health experts and we're all paying the price.  
1261,2020-08-07,<JoeBiden>," here’s how covid-19 affected arizonans under the trump—ducey model:  - an infection rate—still—of nearly 20% - the fifth-highest number of current hospitalizations in the country - more than 4,000 deaths from covid-19 - more than 183,000 cases - lengthy delays in test results
"
1262,2020-08-07,<JoeBiden>," gov. ducey is rushing reopening without adequate testing and contact tracing.  he’s withholding support for increased testing and making local leaders plead for it.  he’s refusing to implement a mask mandate and turning his back on older americans and those at greater risk.
"
1263,2020-08-07,<JoeBiden>," president trump called arizona “a model for applying a science-based approach to the decreasing cases and hospitalizations without implementing a punishing lockdown.” he said governor ducey’s approach should be used by other states—but here’s what’s really happening in arizona:
"
1264,2020-08-06,<JoeBiden>," my commitment to you is this: i will always listen, i will never stop fighting for the african american community and i will never stop fighting for a more equitable future.
"
1265,2020-08-06,<JoeBiden>," throughout my career i've witnessed the diversity of thought, background, and sentiment within the african american community. it's this diversity that makes our workplaces, communities, and country a better place.
"
1266,2020-08-06,<JoeBiden>," earlier today, i made some comments about diversity in the african american and latino communities that i want to clarify. in no way did i mean to suggest the african american community is a monolith—not by identity, not on issues, not at all.
"
1267,2020-08-06,<JoeBiden>," i believe that the right to vote is the most fundamental american right there is. to protect it, we’ve got to:  - pass the john r. lewis voting rights act - enact automatic and same-day voter registration - stand up to republican voter suppression efforts
"
1268,2020-08-06,<JoeBiden>, john lewis left us with marching orders. it’s up to all of us to carry them out:  
1269,2020-08-06,<JoeBiden>," every moment with your loved ones is precious. i know that in my core because i’ve learned it through loss. it's why as president, i'm going to do everything i can to get this virus under control and get our lives back to normal as soon as we can.  "
1270,2020-08-06,<JoeBiden>," let me be clear: voting is a right — not a privilege. anyone who tells you otherwise can’t be trusted to hold the highest office in this land.
"
1271,2020-08-06,<JoeBiden>," the fight for civil rights is what drove me to get involved in politics in the first place. it's why i fought for and helped secure a 25-year extension of the voting rights act. and it's why as president, i'll immediately sign the john r. lewis voting rights act into law.  "
1272,2020-08-06,<JoeBiden>," 55 years ago today, the voting rights act was signed into law — bringing us one step closer to that more perfect union. as we mark its anniversary, we’ve got to continue our fight to restore the vra and protect the sacred right to vote.
"
1273,2020-08-06,<JoeBiden>, the scenes of death and destruction from hiroshima and nagasaki still horrify us 75 years later. they reach through history to remind us of the hideous damage nuclear weapons can inflict—and our collective responsibility to ensure they're never again used.  
1274,2020-08-06,<JoeBiden>," if i'm elected president, our students and educators will have all the tools and resources they need to succeed and get through covid-19.  "
1275,2020-08-05,<JoeBiden>," donald trump promised to bring back jobs, but his policies crushed the manufacturing sector—and that was true even before covid-19.  i’ll revitalize american manufacturing and innovation and create millions of good-paying jobs so we can build back better.  "
1276,2020-08-05,<JoeBiden>," growing up in scranton, i learned the importance of hard work, treating others with dignity and respect, and leaving no one behind. those values have guided my entire life — and they're the values i'll bring back to the white house.  "
1277,2020-08-05,<JoeBiden>," folks, a lot of you have been asking when i’m announcing my running mate, and i promise i’ll let you know soon. but here’s what i can tell you right now: i’m going to tell my supporters first — so text first to 30330 to be the first to know.
"
1278,2020-08-05,<JoeBiden>," i don’t buy for one second that the vitality of american manufacturing is a thing of the past. as president, i'll make bold investments in american manufacturing, industry, and innovation to make sure the future is made in america — by all of america.  "
1279,2020-08-05,<JoeBiden>, there's been a lot of talk about my vetting process lately. here’s an inside look:  
1280,2020-08-05,<JoeBiden>," weapons of war have no place in our communities. when i was a senator, i took on the  and secured a 10-year ban on assault weapons — and as president, i’ll ban these weapons again.  "
1281,2020-08-05,<JoeBiden>," eight years ago, a white supremacist targeted a sikh temple in oak creek, wi — ultimately taking seven lives in an unspeakable act of terror. to truly honor those we lost, it's up to all of us to stand up to bigotry in our lives, give hate no safe harbor, and reduce gun violence.
"
1282,2020-08-05,<JoeBiden>," i truly believe that we can revitalize american manufacturing and create a better economy at the same time. i want to build an economy that brings everyone along — one that works for the middle class, not just the wealthy and well-connected.  "
1283,2020-08-05,<JoeBiden>," the truth of the matter is, donald trump inherited a growing economy from president obama and me. and just like everything else he inherited in his life, he squandered it.  "
1284,2020-08-04,<JoeBiden>," from day one, donald trump downplayed the threat covid-19 posed, ignored scientists, and refused to take action.   now, nearly 5 million cases and more than 150,000 deaths later, it's crystal clear we're paying the price for his failed leadership.
"
1285,2020-08-04,<JoeBiden>," on day one, i’ll send a bill to congress creating a clear roadmap to citizenship for dreamers and the 11 million undocumented people already strengthening our nation. it’s long overdue.  "
1286,2020-08-04,<JoeBiden>," our hearts and prayers are with the people of lebanon, and the victims of the horrific explosion in beirut. i urge both the trump administration and international community to immediately mobilize assistance to the thousands injured in the blast.
"
1287,2020-08-04,<JoeBiden>," thousands of americans are dying every week. the president's response?  ""it is what it is.""  "
1288,2020-08-04,<JoeBiden>, i’ll get to work on day one enacting the changes needed to help the latino community thrive.  read my full plan here:  
1289,2020-08-04,<JoeBiden>," happy birthday to my brother and friend,  serving alongside you for eight years was the greatest honor of my life — and i'm grateful to have you by my side for these next 91 days.  "
1290,2020-08-04,<JoeBiden>," we can’t just build back to the way things were before these crises. we have to build a more inclusive, equitable future for all.  here’s how we’ll do it:  "
1291,2020-08-04,<JoeBiden>," the latino community is bearing disproportionate harm from this pandemic. but even before, many latino families were already struggling. we've got to do better. that's why today, i'm releasing my new agenda for the latino community:  "
1292,2020-08-04,<JoeBiden>," as president, i’ll take on the powerful gun lobby to pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and close loopholes to keep guns out of dangerous hands. we can and will end our gun violence epidemic.
"
1293,2020-08-04,<JoeBiden>," one year ago, just hours after the massacre in el paso, nine precious lives were cut short in dayton. in the wake of the tragedies, donald trump promised the most modest of gun safety policies, then caved to the  and failed to deliver.
"
1294,2020-08-04,<JoeBiden>," on july 1st, donald trump predicted the coronavirus was going to ""just disappear.""  he was wrong — and more than 25,000 americans died due to the virus last month.  mr. president, step up and do your job before even more american families feel the pain of losing a loved one.
"
1295,2020-08-03,<JoeBiden>," when we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy american products and support american jobs. period.  we’re going to make sure the future is made in america — by all of america:  "
1296,2020-08-03,<JoeBiden>," not a joke, folks.  get yours today:  "
1297,2020-08-03,<JoeBiden>," every american should be able to safely make their voice heard this november. we need to:  - expand vote-by-mail and early voting - implement online voter registration - make it safe and easy to vote in-person
"
1298,2020-08-03,<JoeBiden>," jill and i mourn the loss of the nine service members who perished in a training accident off the coast of california. these brave young men made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their fellow americans. our deepest condolences go out to their families.
"
1299,2020-08-03,<JoeBiden>," john hume committed his life to the principles of nonviolence, and through his faith, statesmanship, and perseverance, he helped bring northern ireland through the troubles to a better tomorrow. jill and i send our condolences to the entire hume family.  "
1300,2020-08-03,<JoeBiden>," in the days that followed the el paso shooting, i said americans have to come together, stand against hate, and leave nobody behind.  that charge feels more important than ever. this is our fight — and together, we will win.  "
1301,2020-08-03,<JoeBiden>," it's hard to believe this has to be said, but if i'm elected president, i’ll spend my monday mornings working with our nation’s top experts to control this virus — not insulting them on twitter.
"
1302,2020-08-03,<JoeBiden>," this is a moment to summon the purpose we felt one year ago after el paso. a moment to recommit to the battle for the soul of this nation. a battle against white supremacy, hatred, and gun violence.  it won't be easy — but it's a battle we must win.
"
1303,2020-08-03,<JoeBiden>," one year ago, a white supremacist armed with a semi-automatic rifle targeted the people of el paso. he thought his hatred of latinos and immigrants would prove more powerful than the culture and vibrancy of the community.  he was wrong.  "
1304,2020-08-02,<JoeBiden>," folks, there's simply too much at stake this november for anyone to sit on the sidelines. register to vote today — and then reach out to five friends and get them registered as well.  "
1305,2020-08-02,<JoeBiden>," welcome home, bob and doug! the first american splashdown in 45 years was executed with precision, and is truly a victory for american innovation and persistence. congratulations to everyone involved on a successful conclusion to this historic mission.  "
1306,2020-08-02,<JoeBiden>, join us as we host a roundtable with congresswoman veronica escobar to commemorate the anniversary of the el paso massacre:  
1307,2020-08-02,<JoeBiden>," it’s not enough to just go back to the way things were before these crises — we need to build back better than ever. we have to create a new american economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead.
"
1308,2020-08-02,<JoeBiden>," now more than ever, we need a president who believes in science.
"
1309,2020-08-02,<JoeBiden>, this pandemic has put a bright light on the disparities that have plagued our nation for too long. we’ve got to make sure these communities get the help they need now — and root out the systemic racism that created these inequalities in the first place.  
1310,2020-08-01,<JoeBiden>," enhanced unemployment benefits expired for millions overnight.  we don’t have an effective nationwide testing program or a plan to control the virus.  our health care workers still don’t have enough ppe.  enough with the weekend golf trips, mr. president. do your job.
"
1311,2020-08-01,<JoeBiden>, rent is due today.  donald trump abdicated his responsibility to lead us out of this covid-19 crisis—and we now face a potential housing crisis because of it.  mr. president: act now to make sure americans don't have to choose between a roof over their heads or food on the table.  
1312,2020-08-01,<JoeBiden>, you have enough on your plate — you shouldn't also have to worry about the president making things even tougher for you.  
1313,2020-08-01,<JoeBiden>," if we give donald trump four more years in the white house, he will forever alter the character of this nation.  we can’t let that happen.
"
1314,2020-08-01,<JoeBiden>," to the millions of people who get up every single day and make this country run: i see you, and i promise i will never stop fighting for you. you are the backbone of america.  "
1315,2020-08-01,<JoeBiden>, ordinary people doing extraordinary things. that's the story of america — and it's being written every day by folks like dr.  who fought the ebola outbreak and now covid-19.  and i called to thank him for his service and discuss the moment we're in.  
1316,2020-07-31,<JoeBiden>," folks, we’re just a few hours away from our critical end-of-month fundraising deadline. we need everyone to step up so we can hit our goal and make sure we can go toe-to-toe with president trump.  if you're able, please chip in today:  "
1317,2020-07-31,<JoeBiden>," jill and i are keeping everyone in the path of hurricane isaias in our prayers. we must ensure that our fellow americans, in puerto rico and across the east coast, get the support they need. please heed the warnings from authorities, take steps to prepare, and stay safe.
"
1318,2020-07-31,<JoeBiden>," together, we're going to make sure the future is made in america — by all of america.  "
1319,2020-07-31,<JoeBiden>," grassroots donations are the backbone of our campaign — and we want to thank you for all your help. so tonight, senator  and i are hosting an event that you won’t want to miss.  chip in to reserve your spot:  "
1320,2020-07-31,<JoeBiden>," we’re facing some of the biggest challenges in our history — and it’s abundantly clear donald trump just isn’t up for the job.  we need real leadership — and we need it now.
"
1321,2020-07-31,<JoeBiden>," it’s been over six months since the first confirmed case of covid-19 in the united states, and president trump still doesn't have an effective plan to contain its spread. it's an unjustifiable failure of leadership that costs lives every day.
"
1322,2020-07-30,<JoeBiden>," . and i wish all our muslim friends and neighbors a blessed #eidaladha. may your sacrifices on this day be accepted and strengthen you during these challenging times. eid mubarak!
"
1323,2020-07-30,<JoeBiden>," human trafficking is an unconscionable attack on the dignity of the most vulnerable among us. action can’t wait — on this world day against trafficking in persons, we’ve got to join together and commit to ending trafficking. #endhumantrafficking  "
1324,2020-07-30,<JoeBiden>," you won't have to worry about my tweets when i'm president.
"
1325,2020-07-30,<JoeBiden>, bill barr is the attorney general of the united states — not the president's private attorney.  
1326,2020-07-30,<JoeBiden>," 55 years ago today, medicare and medicaid were signed into law. and ever since, they've extended lives, enhanced liberty, and put the pursuit of happiness within reach for millions.  i'll protect and expand these programs for generations to come.  "
1327,2020-07-30,<JoeBiden>," throughout his life, john lewis taught us that while the journey toward equality is not easy, we must be unafraid and never cower and never, ever give up.  it's up to all of us to carry on his mission.  "
1328,2020-07-30,<JoeBiden>," it’s time senate republicans back their effusive praise of john lewis with action. pass the john r. lewis voting rights act.
"
1329,2020-07-30,<JoeBiden>," even after his passing, john lewis reminds us that the most powerful symbol of what it means to be an american is what we do with the time we have to make real the promise of our nation.  may his words guide us as we march on toward november.  "
1330,2020-07-30,<JoeBiden>," the last three months were the worst period for economic growth our nation has experienced in the 70 years since we started measuring it — a drop of nearly 33 percent.  let's be clear: this is no act of god, it's a failure of presidential leadership.  "
1331,2020-07-30,<JoeBiden>," i'm the proud husband of a teacher. i've seen firsthand how difficult the job can be in normal times — let alone in the middle of a pandemic. so when i heard beth's story, i knew  and i had to give her a call.  "
1332,2020-07-29,<JoeBiden>, donald trump's instinct to constantly add fuel to the fire is the last thing our country needs right now.  we need leadership that will calm the waters and lower the temperature.  
1333,2020-07-29,<JoeBiden>," we need a president who will bring us together instead of tearing us apart and who will enforce the law faithfully rather than put his own political interests first.
"
1334,2020-07-29,<JoeBiden>," folks, i'm excited to share that senator  and i are hosting a grassroots fundraiser this friday — and you're invited. we're going to chat about what's at stake this november and even answer a few of your questions.  chip in any amount to join us:  "
1335,2020-07-29,<JoeBiden>, donald trump has shown that he can’t beat the pandemic or turn the economy around. and he is unsurprisingly stoking the flames of division for political gain.  he is the worst possible person to lead our nation through this moment.  
1336,2020-07-29,<JoeBiden>, my heart goes out to jessica and the countless others across the nation who have lost a loved one due to covid-19. behind every number we see in the news is a family and community that will never again be whole — and we can't forget that.  
1337,2020-07-29,<JoeBiden>," congratulations to california child care providers united on a successful election. as president, i'll make it easier for child care workers to unionize — and i’ll provide resources so they earn higher wages while also making care more affordable. #childcareisessential
"
1338,2020-07-29,<JoeBiden>," we need an effective, coordinated nationwide testing and tracing program. we need more ppe for health care workers. we need a comprehensive plan to get this virus under control.  we need this president to do his job.
"
1339,2020-07-29,<JoeBiden>," i have no illusions about how tough the road ahead is. but i’m optimistic for one reason above all others: i know the history and the heart of this country.  there is nothing we're unable to achieve when we do it together.
"
1340,2020-07-28,<JoeBiden>, listen to the scientists: wear a mask.  
1341,2020-07-28,<JoeBiden>," donald trump voted by mail. you should be able to as well.
"
1342,2020-07-28,<JoeBiden>," small business ownership is one of our country's cornerstones for wealth building and job creation. but black and brown entrepreneurs face far too many barriers to ownership, growth, and success.  i've got a plan to change that:  "
1343,2020-07-28,<JoeBiden>, america has never lived up to our founding promise — and we can’t rest until we finally do. my new plan will advance racial equity across the american economy and bring us closer to reaching our highest ideals:  
1344,2020-07-28,<JoeBiden>," my housing plan will give a $15,000 tax credit to first-time home-buyers, expand affordable housing, and reverse president trump’s efforts to gut fair housing enforcement.  we're going to remove the barriers to homeownership that hold back too many americans of color.
"
1345,2020-07-28,<JoeBiden>," to support more black and brown small businesses, my administration will launch a new small business opportunity initiative. we're going to make sure that those with the best ideas are not denied the venture capital or financing they need because of their race or zip code.
"
1346,2020-07-28,<JoeBiden>," in good times, communities of color still lag. in bad times, they get hit first and the hardest. and in recovery, they take the longest to bounce back.  we have to break the cycle, and i’ve got a plan to do it:  "
1347,2020-07-28,<JoeBiden>," this election is not just about voting against donald trump. it’s about rising to this moment of crisis, understanding people’s struggle, and building a future worthy of their courage and ambition to overcome.
"
1348,2020-07-28,<JoeBiden>," a change of “tone” over a few days does not change the facts of the last four years.  donald trump fails the basic threshold test of being president: the duty to care about the entire country, not just his re-election prospects.
"
1349,2020-07-28,<JoeBiden>," the senate and this president should pass the bill to restore the voting rights act — renamed yesterday in memory of john lewis.  if they don’t, it will be one of the first things i do as president.
"
1350,2020-07-28,<JoeBiden>," i'm in wilmington, delaware, to unveil the fourth plank of my build back better plan. tune in as i discuss what my administration will do to advance racial equity in our economy:  "
1351,2020-07-28,<JoeBiden>," in this moment, we have the chance to build an economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead. one more vibrant and more powerful because everyone is in on the deal.  here's how we'll do it:  "
1352,2020-07-28,<JoeBiden>," we can't build this nation back better without tackling the systemic racism and disparities that have plagued our country for far too long. that's why today, i'm releasing my new plan to advance racial economic equity across the american economy.  "
1353,2020-07-28,<JoeBiden>, our students and educators deserve better than four more years of betsy devos. it’s time for a secretary of education who is actually a public school educator.  
1354,2020-07-27,<JoeBiden>," john — march on, dear friend. may god bless you. and may you continue to inspire righteous good trouble down from the heavens.  "
1355,2020-07-27,<JoeBiden>," tonight, jill and i are thinking about the 150,000 families left emptier by this virus.  to anyone who’s struggling, sick, or wondering how they’ll get through the day: know that i will not abandon you.   we’ll fight through this crisis together, and emerge stronger than ever.
"
1356,2020-07-27,<JoeBiden>," arianna’s a supporter of our campaign who’s been organizing food drives for her community during the covid crisis. my team told me about her work, so  and i decided to surprise her with a call.  "
1357,2020-07-27,<JoeBiden>," the development of a new vaccine requires a dedication to science, coordination, transparency, truth, and fairness to all — and we have a president who stands for none of these things.  "
1358,2020-07-27,<JoeBiden>, these policies aren’t just the right thing to do — they’re also the smart thing to do for the future of our country.  
1359,2020-07-27,<JoeBiden>, women-owned small businesses like marsh + mane are the backbone of communities across the nation. we have got to do more to invest in and support them.  here's what i'll do as president:  
1360,2020-07-27,<JoeBiden>," the hard truth is women — and particularly women of color — have never had a fair shot to get ahead in this country. that's why today, i'm releasing my plan to make sure women can fully participate in our economy and country.  "
1361,2020-07-27,<JoeBiden>," the hard truth is this pandemic didn’t have to be this bad. ron klain, former white house ebola response coordinator, breaks down what a biden administration would have done differently and what we would do now to get this virus under control:  "
1362,2020-07-26,<JoeBiden>," in 100 days, we’re going to make donald trump a one-term president.  "
1363,2020-07-26,<JoeBiden>," women have decided the course of history with grit, clarity, and courage. this election is no different.  we have just 100 days to get out the vote, unite the country, and vote donald trump out of the white house.  join us, and let's get to work:  "
1364,2020-07-26,<JoeBiden>," thirty years on, we still have work to do to realize the full aspiration of the americans with disabilities act. we need to ensure that every american has the chance to live independently and free from discriminatory systems and practices. #ada30  "
1365,2020-07-26,<JoeBiden>," folks, we have just 100 days until election day. now, more than ever, we have to do everything we can to make donald trump a one-term president.  register to vote:  "
1366,2020-07-26,<JoeBiden>," in 100 days, we have the chance to set our nation on a new path. one where we finally live up to our highest ideals and everyone has a fair shot at success.  join us:  "
1367,2020-07-25,<JoeBiden>," as hurricane hanna makes landfall, jill and i are sending our prayers to the people of south texas. we must ensure that affected residents get the support they need — and get it quickly. if you are in an impacted region, please heed the advice of local officials and seek shelter.
"
1368,2020-07-25,<JoeBiden>," i know firsthand how hard it can be to take care of an aging family member. it's why as president, i'll ease the financial burden on families and expand access to dignified care for older americans.  "
1369,2020-07-25,<JoeBiden>," no one should have to work more than one job to make ends meet. we have to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and build an inclusive middle class that brings everyone along.
"
1370,2020-07-25,<JoeBiden>," there is no quit in america — and you deserve a president who won’t quit on you.
"
1371,2020-07-25,<JoeBiden>," president trump ordered his administration to slow down coronavirus testing, he tried to block cdc funding, and he has ignored the experts from day one. his actions defy both logic and humanity.   what kind of president actively undercuts efforts that will save lives?
"
1372,2020-07-25,<JoeBiden>," every american family deserves access to affordable, high-quality child care.  here's how i'll make that happen:  "
1373,2020-07-24,<JoeBiden>," i know times are tough, but i want you to know you're not alone. we're all in this fight together. and together, we'll emerge stronger than before.
"
1374,2020-07-24,<JoeBiden>," the president has a duty to care for us all. to see people where they are and to understand what they’re going through.  i’ve been a single parent. even though i had a lot more support than a lot of folks going through tough times, i know how hard it is.  "
1375,2020-07-24,<JoeBiden>," this is the united states of america. we don’t settle — we aspire.  let’s get to work.
"
1376,2020-07-24,<JoeBiden>," the hard truth is that we can't just build back to the way things were before these crises — we have to build back better.  president  and i discussed how we can do that, and much more:  "
1377,2020-07-24,<JoeBiden>, our nation is at a crossroads. we can choose four more years of donald trump’s divisive politics and failed leadership — or we can forge a new path forward.  
1378,2020-07-24,<JoeBiden>," home care workers and child care workers — who are more often women, women of color, and immigrants — have been underpaid, unseen, and undervalued for far too long.  that will change with my administration:  "
1379,2020-07-23,<JoeBiden>," donald trump’s own staff admits that he fails the most important test of being the american president: the duty to care — for you, for all of us.  "
1380,2020-07-23,<JoeBiden>," we need a president who listens to someone other than himself.
"
1381,2020-07-23,<JoeBiden>," out of every trial and tribulation, we've always emerged stronger as a nation — and we will again. if we come together, there is not a single thing we cannot accomplish.  "
1382,2020-07-23,<JoeBiden>, hey  here’s to hoping we both win big this fall. stay safe. #openingday  
1383,2020-07-23,<JoeBiden>," covid-19 infections are going up.  the number of deaths is going up.   this morning it was announced that, once again, the number of unemployment claims is going up.   donald trump is moving us backwards. the american people are paying the price.
"
1384,2020-07-23,<JoeBiden>," care jobs are ready to be filled right now, allowing millions of people — primarily women — to get back to work immediately.  it's the right thing to do for our families and our essential workers — and it's the smart thing to do for our economy.  "
1385,2020-07-23,<JoeBiden>," folks, i sat down with my friend president  to discuss the significant moment we're in, who we are as a nation, and how we can build back better.   watch our full conversation:  "
1386,2020-07-23,<JoeBiden>," every day i hear from folks who tell me how important health care is to their families — well, it's deeply personal for president  and me, too. i'll fight to protect and build on obamacare and make sure everyone gets the care they need.  watch our conversation:  "
1387,2020-07-22,<JoeBiden>," let me be clear: if vote-by-mail is good enough for donald trump and his administration, then it's good enough for all of us.  "
1388,2020-07-22,<JoeBiden>, i know everything feels different right now. there’s just that feeling where you don’t know if everything will be okay. but i promise you that it can be and it will be.  
1389,2020-07-22,<JoeBiden>," today, the house passed the #nobanact because no one should be discriminated against or singled out based on the faith they practice. i will end president trump's muslim ban on day one and sign this bill into law.
"
1390,2020-07-22,<JoeBiden>," my plan to create a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce will put 3 million americans to work — and free up millions more people to join the paid labor force.  it's a fresh, bold approach that will help us recover faster and stronger.  "
1391,2020-07-22,<JoeBiden>," the goal of the census is clear: count every person. but donald trump continues to use this vital process to sow division and scare immigrant communities.  we won't let him deny communities the funding and representation they deserve. because in america, everyone counts.
"
1392,2020-07-22,<JoeBiden>," the words of a president matter. and from the moment president trump came down that escalator, he has used his to degrade people and sow division. it's not who we are.  watch my full conversation with president  tomorrow at 10 am et.  "
1393,2020-07-22,<JoeBiden>," today, we're facing a serious threat — and we have to meet it together as one country. it's up to all of us to do everything we can to keep our fellow americans safe and healthy.  "
1394,2020-07-21,<JoeBiden>," 10 years ago the obama-biden administration signed wall street reform to prevent the abuse that led to the great recession. donald trump and the republicans have tried to tear it down ever since. as president, i'll protect it so we can rebuild an economy that works for everyone.
"
1395,2020-07-21,<JoeBiden>," for your family, for your neighbors, for your country — wear a mask.
"
1396,2020-07-21,<JoeBiden>," happy birthday, congressman clyburn! your powerful voice of moral clarity never fails to steer us toward a better future — and reminds us all of why we're in public service in the first place. i’m grateful for your leadership and honored to call you a friend.  "
1397,2020-07-21,<JoeBiden>," let me say what president trump won't: russian interference in our elections is a violation of our sovereignty. and if i’m president, i’ll respond accordingly.  "
1398,2020-07-21,<JoeBiden>," home health workers do god’s work, but aren’t paid much. they have few benefits, and 40% are still on snap or medicaid. it's unacceptable.  i'll give caregivers and early childhood educators a much-needed raise.
"
1399,2020-07-21,<JoeBiden>," we need to make high-quality child care affordable and accessible. as president, i'll give every 3- and 4-year-old access to free, high-quality preschool. and low- to middle-income families won’t spend more than 7% of their income on quality care for children under age 5.
"
1400,2020-07-21,<JoeBiden>," we are trapped in a caregiving crisis, within an economic crisis, within a public health crisis. you’re doing everything you can, but this president is not.  if i’m your president, here’s what i would do:  "
1401,2020-07-21,<JoeBiden>," donald trump simply doesn’t understand: we can’t deal with our economic crisis without solving the public health crisis.   and for all his bluster about his expertise on the economy, he is unable to explain how he will actually help the working families hit the hardest.
"
1402,2020-07-21,<JoeBiden>," we have to mobilize a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation. today, i'm delivering remarks about how we're going to get it done. tune in:  "

1404,2020-07-20,<JoeBiden>," in honor of john lewis, c.t. vivian, and all the essential workers who have selflessly risked their lives, the senate should pass a bill that ensures working people get real relief — extended unemployment insurance, rental support, and guaranteed sick leave. #strikeforblacklives
"
1405,2020-07-20,<JoeBiden>," folks, it may be hard to believe, but we have just over 100 days until election day. i know we can beat donald trump and build this nation back better than before — but we need your help to do it.  if you're able, please chip in today:  "
1406,2020-07-20,<JoeBiden>," small manufacturers like mcgregor industries demonstrate the resilience, creativity, and staying-power of america’s industrial base.  together we're going to make sure the future is made in america — by all of america.  "
1407,2020-07-20,<JoeBiden>," today, i am putting the kremlin and other foreign governments on notice: if elected president, i will direct my administration to impose substantial and lasting costs on those who interfere with american elections.  "
1408,2020-07-20,<JoeBiden>," we're paying the price for this president's incompetence every single day.
"
1409,2020-07-20,<JoeBiden>, president trump asked to see the covid death chart.  here you go.  
1410,2020-07-20,<JoeBiden>," every day it becomes clearer: we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. who we are. what we believe. who we want to be. it’s all at stake.  we have to vote donald trump out this november.
"
1411,2020-07-20,<JoeBiden>," imagine the future we can create with donald trump out of the white house. a future where we:  - tackle the climate crisis - build a new american economy - end our gun violence epidemic - ensure our government works for all, not just the wealthy few
"
1412,2020-07-19,<JoeBiden>," in this moment of crisis, we have the chance to build a new american economy. one where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead.  together, we'll get it done.
"
1413,2020-07-19,<JoeBiden>, every day is national ice cream day in my book.  
1414,2020-07-19,<JoeBiden>," mr. president, your ignorance isn’t a virtue or a sign of your strength — it’s undercutting our response to this unprecedented crisis at every turn and it’s costing americans their jobs and their lives.  "
1415,2020-07-19,<JoeBiden>," the hard truth is that it didn’t have to be this bad, but donald trump ignored the experts and refused to take action. he has failed our nation.  "
1416,2020-07-19,<JoeBiden>," now more than ever, we need a president who will choose hope over fear.
"
1417,2020-07-19,<JoeBiden>," banning the confederate flag from military installations was long overdue.   banning the lgbtq pride flag — the very symbol of diversity and inclusion — is undeniably wrong. the pentagon should ensure it is authorized, or as president, i will.    "
1418,2020-07-18,<JoeBiden>," i know of no man with more courage than john lewis. he was a giant walking among us. when i saw him, i couldn’t help but think one thing: “i haven’t done enough.” may his life and legacy inspire every one of us to strive for justice, equality and what is right.  "
1419,2020-07-18,<JoeBiden>," we are made in the image of god, and then there is john lewis. he was truly one-of-a-kind, a moral compass who always knew where to point us and which direction to march. to john’s family, friends, staff, and constituents, jill and i send you our love and prayers.
"
1420,2020-07-17,<JoeBiden>," as president, i will see to it that america once again stands for human rights. that doesn't mean rights only for some, but rights for all — each and every american, and every person, everywhere. no exceptions.  "
1421,2020-07-17,<JoeBiden>," today, we lost a giant of the civil rights movement and a relentless champion in the struggle for justice. reverend c.t. vivian never stopped pushing our nation closer to our highest ideals — and we are better because of it. jill and i are keeping his loved ones in our prayers.
"
1422,2020-07-17,<JoeBiden>," eleven. that's how many times we've broken the single-day record for new covid-19 cases in the last month.  this virus isn't going to ""just disappear"" like president trump wants. it's surging — and we need real leadership from this white house to slow its spread.
"
1423,2020-07-17,<JoeBiden>," i’ve released 21 years of my tax returns — why hasn’t donald trump?  we deserve to know what this president is hiding.
"
1424,2020-07-17,<JoeBiden>, everyone wants our schools to reopen. the question is how to make it safe and how to make it stick. forcing educators and students back into classrooms in areas where infection rates are going up or remaining too high is just plain dangerous.  
1425,2020-07-17,<JoeBiden>," we have to make the places we live, work, and learn healthier and more energy-efficient. that's why my administration will upgrade 4 million buildings and weatherize 2 million homes across the country — creating over one million jobs in the process.  "
1426,2020-07-17,<JoeBiden>," no matter who you supported in 2016, i want you to know that you have a home in our campaign. you’re not just wanted — you’re needed.  together, we're going to beat donald trump and build this nation back better than it was before.  "
1427,2020-07-16,<JoeBiden>," we have the power to write the future we want for our country. don't let anyone tell you differently.
"
1428,2020-07-16,<JoeBiden>," president obama and i left a playbook for president trump on how to fight pandemics. he flat-out ignored it. and we're all paying the price every day.
"
1429,2020-07-16,<JoeBiden>," from day one, donald trump has been focused on the stock market and delivering for his wealthy friends and big corporations.  as president, i will be laser-focused on working families and small businesses.  "
1430,2020-07-16,<JoeBiden>," let's call this what it is: a modern-day poll tax. it's unconscionable.  we need to restore voting rights for individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies — and ensure everyone can make their voice heard at the ballot box.
"
1431,2020-07-16,<JoeBiden>," we are months into this crisis, and our health care workers are still being forced to reuse masks. it’s unacceptable.  mr. president, fix the ppe shortages before you tee off for yet another round of golf.
"
1432,2020-07-16,<JoeBiden>," i've said it before, and i'll say it again: donald trump is the worst possible person to lead us through a public health crisis.  "
1433,2020-07-16,<JoeBiden>," i don’t have bitcoin, and i’ll never ask you to send me any.  but if you want to chip in to help make donald trump a one-term president, you can do that here:  "
1434,2020-07-15,<JoeBiden>," meeting the threat of climate change presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to jolt new life into our economy. we're going to create millions of high-quality, union jobs by building a modern infrastructure and a clean energy future.  "
1435,2020-07-15,<JoeBiden>," there is no time to waste when it comes to addressing the existential threat of climate change. if i have the honor of being elected president, we'll get to work delivering results on day one.  "
1436,2020-07-15,<JoeBiden>," president trump needs to do everything in his power to surge nationwide testing — including developing and evaluating more accurate, affordable, accessible, faster tests so we can reopen safely.  infection rates are rising at an alarming pace. mr. president, act now.
"
1437,2020-07-15,<JoeBiden>," mr. president, “open everything now,” isn’t a strategy for success. it’s barely a slogan.   it’s long past time for you to step up and do your job.
"
1438,2020-07-15,<JoeBiden>, this pandemic has gotten bad enough that even donald trump finally decided to wear a mask in public.  i’m glad he made that shift — but it’s not enough.  we need real presidential leadership. right now.  
1439,2020-07-14,<JoeBiden>," we're facing an economic crisis and a climate crisis.    as president, i'll create millions of jobs building resilient roads and bridges, manufacturing electric vehicles, and weatherizing homes and buildings.   learn more:  "
1440,2020-07-14,<JoeBiden>," when i hear the words climate change, i hear the word ""jobs."" good paying, union jobs that will solve our jobs crisis while addressing our climate crisis.  "
1441,2020-07-14,<JoeBiden>," climate change is the challenge that's going to define our american future. and if i have the honor of being elected president, we won't tinker around the edges, we’ll seize this opportunity and meet this moment in history.
"
1442,2020-07-14,<JoeBiden>," when donald trump thinks about climate change, all he can muster is one word: “hoax.”   when i think about climate change, i think of a word as well: “jobs.”   good-paying, union jobs that put americans to work.  "
1443,2020-07-14,<JoeBiden>," every few weeks when he needs a distraction from the latest charge of corruption in his staff — or the conviction of high ranking members of his administration — donald trump announces it’s “infrastructure week.”  he's never delivered. i know how to get it done.
"
1444,2020-07-14,<JoeBiden>, we can’t just build things back to the way they were — we’ve got to build america back better. tune in as i deliver remarks on how we're going to invest in infrastructure and clean energy and create millions of jobs in the process:  
1445,2020-07-14,<JoeBiden>," i want every single american to know: if you're sick, struggling, or worried about how you're going to get through the day, i will not abandon you.  we're all in this together. and together, we'll emerge stronger than before.  "
1446,2020-07-13,<JoeBiden>," we shouldn't have to beg this president to listen to the experts.
"
1447,2020-07-13,<JoeBiden>," the hard truth is it didn't have to be this bad. but donald trump has squandered every chance he's had to contain the spread of this virus.
"
1448,2020-07-13,<JoeBiden>, america can’t sit on the sidelines in the race for the future. my administration will invest $300 billion in research and development over four years to secure our global leadership and create millions of good-paying jobs.  
1449,2020-07-13,<JoeBiden>," ""we're leading the world.""  "
1450,2020-07-13,<JoeBiden>," donald trump needs to spend less time playing golf and more time listening to experts like dr. fauci.
"
1451,2020-07-13,<JoeBiden>," in january, i sounded the alarm regarding covid-19.   over five months later, president trump still hasn't taken the action needed to respond to the virus. it's unacceptable.  this president has failed the american people every step of the way.  "
1452,2020-07-12,<JoeBiden>," the stakes couldn't be higher this november. time and time again, donald trump has failed the people of puerto rico.  as president, i'll spur economic development on the island and expand access to health care.
"
1453,2020-07-12,<JoeBiden>," together, we're going to build a new american economy:  "
1454,2020-07-12,<JoeBiden>," it's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, i'll actually listen to the experts and heed their advice. not silence them.
"
1455,2020-07-12,<JoeBiden>," mohamed amashah is finally home after 486 days in egyptian prison for holding a protest sign. arresting, torturing, and exiling activists like sarah hegazy and mohamed soltan or threatening their families is unacceptable. no more blank checks for trump’s ""favorite dictator.""
"
1456,2020-07-12,<JoeBiden>, ignore the polls.  we’ve got work to do:  
1457,2020-07-12,<JoeBiden>," health care is personal to me. and as president, i'll do everything i can to make sure every american has access to the care they need.  "
1458,2020-07-12,<JoeBiden>," we need a president who will always choose to unite rather than divide, because there’s nothing we can’t accomplish when we do it together.
"
1459,2020-07-12,<JoeBiden>," to all the nurses on the frontlines of this fight, thank you. you are american heroes.  "
1460,2020-07-11,<JoeBiden>," donald trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this moment.  we need real leadership, right now. lives are at stake.
"
1461,2020-07-11,<JoeBiden>," back in january, when president trump signed his hollow ""phase one"" trade deal with beijing, i made clear that no one should be fooled by trump's empty promises to deliver a meaningful “phase two"" deal.  good to see that he's finally admitting i was right.  "
1462,2020-07-11,<JoeBiden>," i’ve said it before, and i’ll say it again: donald trump is the most corrupt president in modern american history. every day that he remains in office, he further threatens the future of our democracy.  we have to vote him out this november.
"
1463,2020-07-11,<JoeBiden>," i have no illusion about how tough the road ahead is. but i’m optimistic for one reason above all others: i know the history and the heart of this country.  given a chance, ordinary americans can do extraordinary things.  "
1464,2020-07-11,<JoeBiden>, this was almost two months ago.   since then? tens of thousands more lives lost. a million and a half new cases.  the president? still golfing.  
1465,2020-07-11,<JoeBiden>," the united states has over 3 million cases of covid-19, and over 130,000 people have died — yet donald trump continues to say it will just ""fade away."" it’s unbelievable.  we're paying the price for this president's incompetence every single day.
"
1466,2020-07-11,<JoeBiden>," i see a different america than president trump. one that, despite all our flaws and shortcomings and failings, is still after more than two centuries dedicated to equality, liberty, human dignity, and justice.  i know we can reach our highest ideals — together.
"
1467,2020-07-10,<JoeBiden>," determination. resilience. grit. the strength to get up no matter how many times you’ve been knocked down. respect for hard work, and for the people who do it.   those are the values i learned growing up in scranton — and they're the values i’ll take to the oval office.
"
1468,2020-07-10,<JoeBiden>, this is what “america first” looks like under president trump:  
1469,2020-07-10,<JoeBiden>," through every trial and tribulation, we've always emerged stronger — and we will again.
"
1470,2020-07-10,<JoeBiden>, let’s use this opportunity to make bold investments in american industry and innovation so the future is made in america — and in all of america.   
1471,2020-07-10,<JoeBiden>," here's my promise to you: if i have the honor of being elected president, i will take care of your family like i would my own.  "
1472,2020-07-09,<JoeBiden>," the american people deserve to know what donald trump is hiding in his tax returns.
"
1473,2020-07-09,<JoeBiden>," we can't just build back to the way things were before these crises — we have to build back better.
"
1474,2020-07-09,<JoeBiden>, this is our moment to imagine and build a new american economy — one where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead.  
1475,2020-07-09,<JoeBiden>," i do not buy for one second that the vitality of american manufacturing is a thing of the past.   american manufacturing was the arsenal of democracy in world war ii, and must be part of the engine of american prosperity now.
"
1476,2020-07-09,<JoeBiden>, we can't just focus on the jobs of today — we have to also focus on the jobs and industries of tomorrow. i'll make a historic $300 billion investment in research and development that will spur innovation and help create 3 million jobs across the nation.  
1477,2020-07-09,<JoeBiden>," american workers can out-compete anyone, but they need a government that fights for them. i'll revitalize american manufacturing — especially smaller manufacturers and those owned by women and people of color — and ensure the future is made here in america.  "
1478,2020-07-09,<JoeBiden>," when we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy american products &amp; support american jobs.  but under trump, the rate of federal contractors offshoring jobs more than doubled. it's unacceptable.  i'll invest $400 billion in american-made products &amp; keep jobs here at home.  "
1479,2020-07-09,<JoeBiden>," i'm in dunmore, pennsylvania, to discuss my plan to create jobs, raise wages, and help america build back better. tune in to watch:  "
1480,2020-07-09,<JoeBiden>, we're in the middle of an economic crisis. but it's not enough to just turn things around — we have to build back better. we have to revitalize american manufacturing and make sure the future is made in america — by all of america.  here's how we'll do it:  
1481,2020-07-09,<JoeBiden>, the future must be made in america — by all of america. here's how we'll do it:  
1482,2020-07-08,<JoeBiden>," four years of betsy devos is more than enough. we need a secretary of education who is actually a public school educator.
"
1483,2020-07-08,<JoeBiden>," i commend the task forces for their service and for helping build a bold, transformative platform for our party and for our country. and i am deeply grateful to  for working with us to unite our party and deliver real, lasting change for generations to come.
"
1484,2020-07-08,<JoeBiden>, increased testing isn’t the reason for the surge in coronavirus cases — donald trump's failed leadership is.  
1485,2020-07-08,<JoeBiden>," trump launched his 2016 campaign by calling mexicans rapists.  he's spread racism against our latino community ever since.  we need to work in partnership with mexico.  we need to restore dignity and humanity to our immigration system.  that's what i'll do as president.
"
1486,2020-07-08,<JoeBiden>, let me be clear: no one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a pandemic because they can’t pay rent.  
1487,2020-07-08,<JoeBiden>," when there were 15 cases, the president said it wouldn't spread any farther.   we just hit our 3 millionth case.  we're paying for his failure.  "
1488,2020-07-08,<JoeBiden>," . — the courage you show every day is an inspiration to so many, and i'm grateful to have you by my side in this fight. we may not agree on everything, but this we do: health care is a right — not a privilege. and we're going to make that a reality, together.
"
1489,2020-07-07,<JoeBiden>," this is a national disgrace. we have to ensure these communities get the care they need immediately — and then tackle racial disparities in health care and our economy head-on.
"
1490,2020-07-07,<JoeBiden>, the most sacred obligation of our government is to keep our troops safe when we send them into battle — and to care for them when they come home. we need a president who will honor that obligation.  
1491,2020-07-07,<JoeBiden>," across the world, people come to this country with unrelenting optimism and determination toward the future. they study here, innovate here, they make america who we are. donald trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does.
"
1492,2020-07-07,<JoeBiden>," americans are safer when america is engaged in strengthening global health. on my first day as president, i will rejoin the  and restore our leadership on the world stage.
"
1493,2020-07-07,<JoeBiden>," we've seen what happens when the federal government fails to secure sufficient supplies of critical products like ppe — and we can't let it happen again. so today, i'm releasing my plan to rebuild u.s. supply chains:  "
1494,2020-07-07,<JoeBiden>," donald trump needs to do his job.
"
1495,2020-07-07,<JoeBiden>, character belongs in the white house.  
1496,2020-07-07,<JoeBiden>," to beat covid-19, we need a coordinated national response from the federal government — but donald trump refuses to do his job. i've laid out exactly what i would do, and i encourage this president to adopt the plan in its entirety:  "
1497,2020-07-06,<JoeBiden>," there’s enormous opportunity once we defeat donald trump. we are going to build our health care system, our economy, and our country back better than they've ever been before.
"
1498,2020-07-06,<JoeBiden>, the nation is crying out for leadership — leadership that can unite us and bring us together. but this president has nothing to offer.  
1499,2020-07-06,<JoeBiden>," with covid-19 surging across the nation, donald trump should be doing everything in his power to increase access to testing. instead, he's doing the opposite. it's despicable.
"
1500,2020-07-06,<JoeBiden>, it didn't have to be this bad. but donald trump failed to do his job — and we're all paying the price.  
1501,2020-07-06,<JoeBiden>, we can’t afford four more years of donald trump.  
1502,2020-07-05,<JoeBiden>," we're going to beat donald trump. and when we do, we won't just rebuild this nation — we'll transform it.
"
1503,2020-07-05,<JoeBiden>," there are so many unsung heroes in our communities, especially in times of crisis. we owe alassane and countless others a debt of gratitude — and i'll fight for them every day in the white house.  "
1504,2020-07-05,<JoeBiden>," on this venezuelan independence day, my thoughts are with venezuelans who continue to work tirelessly for the cause of democracy. it’s time for free and fair elections so that the venezuelan people can turn the page on the corrupt and repressive maduro regime.
"
1505,2020-07-05,<JoeBiden>," covid-19 is surging across the nation, and this president is doubling down on his efforts to rip health insurance and protections away from millions. it's heartless and cruel and must be stopped.
"
1506,2020-07-05,<JoeBiden>," donald trump wants to declare this health crisis over and unemployment solved so that he can get back to his campaign rallies. but he’s wrong — on both fronts.  we need a president who will actually do the work needed to get us through these crises.
"
1507,2020-07-05,<JoeBiden>," the hard truth is that it didn’t have to be this bad, but donald trump ignored the warnings and refused to take action. he failed our nation.  "
1508,2020-07-05,<JoeBiden>, i’ve carried the middle class values that my parents instilled in me my entire life — and they’re the values i’ll bring to the white house.  
1509,2020-07-04,<JoeBiden>," make no mistake, our best days still lie ahead. if we come together as one america, there’s not a single thing we cannot do.
"
1510,2020-07-04,<JoeBiden>, the health care workers on the frontlines of this fight are some of the greatest heroes our nation has ever seen.  
1511,2020-07-04,<JoeBiden>," america was founded on the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all — and it's long past time we lived up to it.
"
1512,2020-07-04,<JoeBiden>," american history isn’t a fairytale. the battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push-and-pull for more than 240 years. but it’s a battle we can and will win — together.
"
1513,2020-07-04,<JoeBiden>," this fourth of july, one of the most patriotic things you can do is wear a mask.
"
1514,2020-07-04,<JoeBiden>," our nation was founded on a simple idea: we're all created equal. we've never lived up to it — but we've never stopped trying. this independence day, let's not just celebrate those words, let's commit to finally fulfill them. happy #fourthofjuly!  "
1515,2020-07-03,<JoeBiden>," “if you put the wrong person in office, you'll see things that you would not have believed are possible.""  "
1516,2020-07-03,<JoeBiden>," it didn't have to be this bad. but month after month, as other leaders in other countries took the necessary steps to get the virus under control, donald trump failed us.  here's what i'll do as president:  "
1517,2020-07-03,<JoeBiden>," it’s abundantly clear that this virus isn’t going to just “fade away,” mr. president. it’s time for you to step up, take action, and lead.
"
1518,2020-07-03,<JoeBiden>," now more than ever, we need a president who will choose science over fiction.
"
1519,2020-07-03,<JoeBiden>, donald trump styled himself as a wartime president. but now it seems this president has surrendered. he has waved the white flag and left the field of battle when we need him most. it's unacceptable.  we need real leadership. right now.  
1520,2020-07-03,<JoeBiden>," we are five months into this crisis, and our health care workers still don't have the masks and protective equipment they need. it's a national disgrace.  mr. president, use your authority and fix the shortage of ppe before you tee off for yet another round of golf.
"
1521,2020-07-02,<JoeBiden>," donald trump has called himself a ""cheerleader"" for the nation. but we don't need a cheerleader — we need a president. one who will:  - lead by example - take responsibility - tell the unvarnished truth - listen to the experts and follow the science
"
1522,2020-07-02,<JoeBiden>," let me be clear: there’s no victory to be celebrated when we’re still down nearly 15 million jobs and the pandemic is getting worse, not better.
"
1523,2020-07-02,<JoeBiden>, this is a job donald trump is entirely unfit for.  
1524,2020-07-02,<JoeBiden>," “mr. president, it's too much.”  "
1525,2020-07-02,<JoeBiden>," this is a shameful move. now is the time for employers to have empathy for families juggling work and caregiving.  it's long past time for president trump to show some leadership so we can get this virus under control.
"
1526,2020-07-02,<JoeBiden>, tune in as i address the nation on the economic crisis and the latest jobs report:  
1527,2020-07-01,<JoeBiden>," mr. president, this pandemic isn't about you. it's about the health and well-being of the american people.  "
1528,2020-07-01,<JoeBiden>," i’ll read my daily briefings.
"
1529,2020-07-01,<JoeBiden>," small businesses are the backbone of communities across our nation, and we need to do so much more to help them. donald trump may have forgotten about them — but i never will.  "
1530,2020-07-01,<JoeBiden>," if the reports are true, donald trump either read his briefings about the russian bounties and did nothing — or he didn't read them at all. either way, it's an unjustifiable dereliction of duty.  the american people deserve answers.  "
1531,2020-07-01,<JoeBiden>," on day one, i’ll get right to work tackling covid-19. i'll bring together our nation's top experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.  we are all in this together — and we've got to fight this together.  "
1532,2020-07-01,<JoeBiden>," we need a clear message from the very top of our federal government that everyone needs to wear a mask in public. period.  it’s not just about you — it’s about your family, your neighbors, your colleagues. it’s about keeping other people safe.
"
1533,2020-07-01,<JoeBiden>," this is my promise to you: when i am president, i will take care of your health care coverage and your family the same way i would my own.  "
1534,2020-06-30,<JoeBiden>," as #immigrantheritagemonth comes to a close, i want to make one thing clear: immigrants have always made our nation stronger — our diversity is, and has always been, our greatest strength.  donald trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does.
"
1535,2020-06-30,<JoeBiden>," folks, we’re just a few hours away from our end-of-quarter deadline, and we need your help to hit our goal. every donation — big or small — goes a long way to helping us catch up to donald trump.  if you can, please chip in today:  "
1536,2020-06-30,<JoeBiden>," on the final day of #pridemonth, here’s my promise to you: if i have the honor of being elected, i will be the most pro-equality president in our nation’s history. lgbtq+ rights are human rights — and we can't rest until everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law.
"
1537,2020-06-30,<JoeBiden>, we’re facing a serious threat — and we need to meet it together as one country. but this president gives us no direction and actively pits us against one another.  we can't continue on like this.  
1538,2020-06-30,<JoeBiden>," if i’m elected, i’ll immediately reach out to dr. fauci and ask him to continue his incredible service to our country.   i’ll have the nation’s top medical experts and scientists ready to advise our response on day one — and i'll actually listen to them.
"
1539,2020-06-30,<JoeBiden>," mr. president, the american people didn’t make enormous sacrifices over the past four months so you could waste your time with late night rants and tweets.  step up. take responsibility. do your job.
"
1540,2020-06-30,<JoeBiden>," tune in as i deliver remarks on how president trump failed to protect the american people, save our economy, and control the virus:  "
1541,2020-06-30,<JoeBiden>," i want every single american to know: if you’re sick, if you’re struggling, if you’re worried about how you’re going to get through the day — i will not abandon you. i will not leave you to face these challenges alone.  we are going to get through this — together.
"
1542,2020-06-29,<JoeBiden>," as simple as it sounds, we need a president who listens. so much of this could have been prevented if donald trump listened to someone other than himself.
"
1543,2020-06-29,<JoeBiden>," folks, tomorrow night marks our first end-of-quarter deadline of the general election. we need your help to hit our goal so we can catch up to donald trump's hefty cash-on-hand advantage.   i know times are tough, but if you're able, please chip in today:  "
1544,2020-06-29,<JoeBiden>, the president spent his weekend golfing.  
1545,2020-06-29,<JoeBiden>," here’s my promise to you: i’ll appoint a director who will actually go after financial predators and protect consumers.
"
1546,2020-06-29,<JoeBiden>," today's decision reaffirmed that states can't put in place laws that unduly burden a woman's right to make her own health care decisions—but the fight isn't over. as president, i'll codify roe v. wade and protect a woman’s constitutional right to choose.   "
1547,2020-06-29,<JoeBiden>," it's time we remember who we are as americans: we treat each other with dignity and respect, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor.  we are everything that donald trump is not.
"
1548,2020-06-29,<JoeBiden>," william perry pendley spent his career fighting to sell off public lands — and to allow drilling, mining, and logging on them with hardly any oversight.   now the president has nominated him to oversee them at  consider me opposed.
"
1549,2020-06-28,<JoeBiden>," white supremacy should be rooted out and relegated to the pages of history — not promoted by the president of the united states.
"
1550,2020-06-28,<JoeBiden>," the arc of the moral universe bent a little bit more today.
"
1551,2020-06-28,<JoeBiden>, obamacare was and is a big deal. we can't let donald trump tear it down — we have to protect and build on it.  
1552,2020-06-28,<JoeBiden>," 51 years ago today, a movement was born on christopher street. as we remember the anniversary of the stonewall uprising and the brave individuals who changed our world forever, let's recommit to finishing the job and finally achieving full lgbtq+ equality. #pride  "
1553,2020-06-28,<JoeBiden>," donald trump's entire presidency has been a gift to putin, but this is beyond the pale. it’s a betrayal of the most sacred duty we bear as a nation, to protect and equip our troops when we send them into harm’s way.  "
1554,2020-06-28,<JoeBiden>," today the president shared a video of people shouting “white power” and said they were “great.” just like he did after charlottesville.   we’re in a battle for the soul of the nation — and the president has picked a side. but make no mistake: it’s a battle we will win.
"
1555,2020-06-27,<JoeBiden>," children should be released from ice detention with their parents immediately. this is pretty simple, and i can't believe i have to say it: families belong together.  "
1556,2020-06-27,<JoeBiden>," now, let's push our progress further.   "
1557,2020-06-27,<JoeBiden>," every day that donald trump sits in the oval office, he proves just how unfit he is to lead our nation.
"
1558,2020-06-27,<JoeBiden>," if donald trump prevails in the u.s. supreme court, insurers could strip away your health insurance coverage or jack up premiums — simply because you experience long-term effects after battling the coronavirus.  we can't let that happen.  "
1559,2020-06-26,<JoeBiden>," equal representation and participation matter. #dcstatehood

1560,2020-06-26,<JoeBiden>," i know these times are dark, but i firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. if we come together as one america, there's nothing that we can't accomplish.
"
1561,2020-06-26,<JoeBiden>, health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the few. we have to ensure every single american has access to the care they need and deserve.  here’s what i would do as president:  
1562,2020-06-26,<JoeBiden>," congratulations, alexis. we need you in this fight. proud to stand with you and planned parenthood action fund.
"
1563,2020-06-26,<JoeBiden>, donald trump is acting like a child who just can’t believe this pandemic has happened to him.  
1564,2020-06-26,<JoeBiden>," last week, president trump claimed the virus would ""fade away.""  now, we're facing a record-high number of new cases, and it's surging across the country.  trump refuses to listen to the experts and take action — and we're all paying the price.
"
1565,2020-06-25,<JoeBiden>," in this moment, we have an enormous opportunity to root out systemic racism and close the racial wealth and income gaps. we can do it, together.  "
1566,2020-06-25,<JoeBiden>," donald trump is the worst possible person to lead us through a global pandemic.
"
1567,2020-06-25,<JoeBiden>," dc should be a state. pass it on.
"
1568,2020-06-25,<JoeBiden>," the american people have sacrificed so much to fight this virus — we've lost lives, businesses, paychecks. and now, we're losing the progress we've made because this president refuses to do his job.  donald trump has failed our nation every step of the way.
"
1569,2020-06-25,<JoeBiden>," while president trump continues his victory lap, over 20 million americans remain out of work. he may have forgotten about you, but i never will — and i'll fight for you every single day in the white house.
"
1570,2020-06-25,<JoeBiden>," while the trump administration continues their efforts to rip health care away from millions, i'm speaking about how we can make quality, affordable health care available to every american.  tune in:  "
1571,2020-06-25,<JoeBiden>, health care workers are selflessly risking their lives every day on the front lines of the fight against covid-19 — and hundreds have paid the ultimate price.  they are american heroes — and we cannot forget the sacrifices they made to care for us all.  
1572,2020-06-25,<JoeBiden>," democracy is under threat globally. restoring the soul of america means fixing democracy at home, and confronting — not cozying up to — dictators around the world. when i'm president, america will defend democracy at home and abroad.  "
1573,2020-06-25,<JoeBiden>," health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the few.
"
1574,2020-06-24,<JoeBiden>," this virus is not just going to disappear because you want it to, mr. president.  listen to the experts. take clear, concrete action. do your job.
"
1575,2020-06-24,<JoeBiden>," tonight,  and i will be hosting ""a community of pride"" to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the world's first pride march. join us,    and  at 7:30 pm et:  "
1576,2020-06-24,<JoeBiden>," i am proud to have the  under the exceptional leadership of my friend gina mccarthy, by my side. together, we'll lead the world in a clean energy revolution that will help us reduce our carbon emissions and create good-paying union jobs.
"
1577,2020-06-24,<JoeBiden>, ignore the polls.   register to vote:  
1578,2020-06-24,<JoeBiden>," brian — the courage and strength you've shown in the face of daunting odds is an inspiration to us all. i'm confident that with folks like you leading the way and with the power of our best minds, we'll find treatments and cures and beat this thing once and for all.
"
1579,2020-06-24,<JoeBiden>," workers called back on the job deserve access to regular, reliable covid-19 testing.
"
1580,2020-06-23,<JoeBiden>," instead of passing police reform or helping hardworking americans get through this crisis, republicans are jamming through another one of trump’s unqualified nominees. it's wrong.  cory wilson lacks judicial temperament and experience—and has no place on a federal court.
"
1581,2020-06-23,<JoeBiden>," we need a president who will expand access to quality, affordable health care — not rip it away.
"
1582,2020-06-23,<JoeBiden>," to everyone who is scared, hurting, and wondering what's going to happen next: i want you to know i see you. i hear you. and i'll fight for you every single day in the white house.  "
1583,2020-06-23,<JoeBiden>, our planet cannot take four more years of donald trump.  
1584,2020-06-23,<JoeBiden>," the american people are tough, resilient, and always full of hope. there’s not a single thing we can't do if we do it together.
"
1585,2020-06-23,<JoeBiden>, it's clear donald trump will stop at nothing to tear down obamacare and rip health care away from millions. we cannot let him get away with it. we have to build on the aca with a new public option to ensure everyone receives the care they deserve.  
1586,2020-06-23,<JoeBiden>," it's pretty simple: if we want to save people's jobs and save people's lives, we need more testing — and we need it faster. the president is intentionally slowing it down.
"
1587,2020-06-23,<JoeBiden>," this is yet another attempt to distract from this administration's failure to lead an effective response to covid-19. immigrants help grow our economy and create jobs. the president can't scapegoat his way out of this crisis.
"
1588,2020-06-22,<JoeBiden>," it's worth repeating that this weekend, president trump admitted he directed his administration to slow down coronavirus testing in the middle of a global pandemic.  he continues to prove just how unfit he is to lead our nation.
"
1589,2020-06-22,<JoeBiden>," to ashley, and all the health care workers on the front lines of this fight, thank you. you are american heroes.  "
1590,2020-06-22,<JoeBiden>," tomorrow, president  and i are hosting a virtual grassroots fundraiser. we’ll be answering some of your questions and taking a few trips down memory lane. you won’t want to miss it.   time is running out to reserve your spot. rsvp today:  "
1591,2020-06-22,<JoeBiden>," the strength of the lgbtq+ community has always been rooted in the ability to find hope in spite of setbacks. if we stand together #unitedbypride, we'll get through this — and emerge stronger.  "
1592,2020-06-22,<JoeBiden>, no one should have to choose between their paycheck and their health. that's why my plan for a safe and effective reopening ensures everyone has access to testing and paid leave for all those who get sick from covid-19.  read more here:  
1593,2020-06-22,<JoeBiden>," we can overcome four years of donald trump. but if we give him eight years in the white house, he will forever alter the character of our nation.  we can't stand by and let that happen.
"
1594,2020-06-22,<JoeBiden>, from my days as a public defender to my time as vice president — i've spent my career fighting against injustice. and i'm not finished yet.  
1595,2020-06-21,<JoeBiden>," trump talks tough on venezuela, but admires thugs and dictators like nicolas maduro.   as president, i will stand with the venezuelan people and for democracy.
"
1596,2020-06-21,<JoeBiden>," trump opposed sanctioning china’s government over its atrocious human rights violations to protect his hollow trade deal and serve his own personal interests.  where trump has been weak, i will be strong, clear, and consistent in standing up for america's values and its people.
"
1597,2020-06-21,<JoeBiden>," my dad instilled a lot in me, but perhaps most important is the belief that there’s no higher calling than to be a good parent. happy father’s day to all the dads working to help raise their children — and all our children — to be honorable, generous, and kind.  "
1598,2020-06-21,<JoeBiden>," i can't believe i have to say this, but we should be speeding up testing — not slowing it down.  "
1599,2020-06-21,<JoeBiden>," it’s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we’ve made some of our greatest progress. if we stand together, as one america, we'll rise stronger than before.  "
1600,2020-06-20,<JoeBiden>, i've found that the way to overcome enormous tragedy in your life is to turn that grief and pain into purpose. christian cooper and i discussed how we can take our collective pain in this moment and turn it into a catalyst for change:  
1601,2020-06-20,<JoeBiden>," this nation has always strived to serve as a beacon of hope, but trump has made it clear that he does not believe our country should be a place of refuge.   as president, i'll recommit to building a more inclusive and welcoming america. #worldrefugeeday    "
1602,2020-06-20,<JoeBiden>, folks credit me for speaking out on marriage equality in 2012 — but i'm not the one who took a real risk. countless others did the hard work and paid a price just for being themselves. christian cooper and i discussed the trailblazers who came before us and the work that remains:  
1603,2020-06-20,<JoeBiden>," donald trump is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he’s willing to put people at risk and violate cdc guidelines — as long as they sign a waiver promising not to hold his campaign liable.  unbelievable.
"
1604,2020-06-20,<JoeBiden>, the tulsa race massacre is one of the worst incidents of racial violence in our history — and it has been erased from our national consciousness for far too long.  it’s time we reckon with what happened in 1921.  
1605,2020-06-20,<JoeBiden>," christian cooper’s encounter in central park was another wake-up call for our nation and a reminder of the work that remains to root out hate and intolerance. i'm grateful for christian's support and know with folks like him leading the way, we'll get the job done.  "
1606,2020-06-20,<JoeBiden>," we're months into this pandemic and still don't have proper testing, ppe, or clear nationwide guidance. instead, donald trump:  - pushes dangerous, disproven drugs - stands in the way of the cdc - refuses to wear a mask  he is failing even the most basic test of leadership.
"
1607,2020-06-19,<JoeBiden>," i know it can be hard to keep faith that we will ever achieve that more perfect union we strive to be. but ours is a union worth fighting for — and we are all called to the cause.  none of us can turn away. none of us can stay silent.
"
1608,2020-06-19,<JoeBiden>," donald trump’s failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies on twitter has cost us lives — and is putting hope for an economic recovery at risk.
"
1609,2020-06-19,<JoeBiden>, i’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. who we are. what we believe. and maybe most important — who we want to be. it’s all at stake.  that's the case we're making in our first tv ad of the general election:  
1610,2020-06-19,<JoeBiden>," #juneteenth reminds us of how vulnerable our nation is to being poisoned by systems and acts of inhumanity—but it's also a reminder of our ability to change. together, we can lay the roots of real and lasting justice, and become the extraordinary nation that was promised to all.
"
1611,2020-06-18,<JoeBiden>," amy — from the moment you announced you were running for president in a snowstorm, it wasn't hard to see you had the grit and determination to do anything you set your mind to. you know how to get things done. with your help, we’re going to beat donald trump.
"
1612,2020-06-18,<JoeBiden>, to all the dreamers who make our country better and stronger every single day: thank you. this country needs you. #homeishere  
1613,2020-06-18,<JoeBiden>," the decisions of the last few days should remind us all of the immense power of the supreme court — and the generational impact its justices can have.  we have the power to shape the court's future this november — and we can’t forget that.
"
1614,2020-06-18,<JoeBiden>," i'm ready on day one. after more than three years in office, why isn't donald trump ready?  "
1615,2020-06-18,<JoeBiden>," dreamers are americans. period.
"
1616,2020-06-18,<JoeBiden>," just like donald trump couldn’t wish covid-19 away in march, and just like he couldn’t tweet it away in april — he can’t ignore it away in june.  "
1617,2020-06-18,<JoeBiden>," here’s my promise to you: on day one, i’ll send a bill to congress that creates a clear roadmap to citizenship for dreamers and 11 million undocumented people who are already strengthening our nation. it’s long overdue.
"
1618,2020-06-18,<JoeBiden>," it didn’t have to be this bad. but we have a president who is more interested in taking a victory lap than he is in doing the work needed to solve this crisis.  we need a president who will put the american people first — and actually do the work.
"
1619,2020-06-18,<JoeBiden>," thanks, barack. you're right — and we won't stop until every dreamer feels safe in this country.
"
1620,2020-06-18,<JoeBiden>," donald trump inherited a growing economy from president obama and me. and just like everything else he has inherited in his life, he has squandered it.  "
1621,2020-06-18,<JoeBiden>," the supreme court’s ruling today is a victory made possible by the courage and resilience of hundreds of thousands of daca recipients who bravely stood up and refused to be ignored. and as president, i will get to work immediately to make it permanent.  "
1622,2020-06-17,<JoeBiden>," donald trump wants to style himself a wartime president against an invisible enemy — but he has surrendered the fight.  instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he has waved the white flag and retreated.
"
1623,2020-06-17,<JoeBiden>," vice president pence claimed success because covid-19 deaths are “down to” fewer than 750 a day.  that's more than 20,000 a month — and they're self-congratulating? unbelievable.  it may be good enough for president trump, but it will never be acceptable if i am president.  "
1624,2020-06-17,<JoeBiden>," i’m proud to stand with folks across the country participating in today’s #workersfirst caravan. senate republicans need to pass the #heroesact now and take action to root out systemic racism.
"
1625,2020-06-17,<JoeBiden>," if john bolton's accounts are true, it’s not only morally repugnant, it’s a violation of donald trump’s sacred duty to the american people to protect america’s interests and defend our values.
"
1626,2020-06-17,<JoeBiden>," donald trump ignored the experts, downplayed the threat covid-19 posed, and failed to take the action necessary to contain it — and now in many states, covid cases are on the rise again.  this president has failed to lead our nation.
"
1627,2020-06-17,<JoeBiden>," five years ago, nine good souls were ripped from this world — killed by hate and white supremacy. today, we honor the memory of the emanuel nine and the unspeakable grace of those they left behind.  "
1628,2020-06-17,<JoeBiden>," i'm in darby, pennsylvania, to discuss how we can make sure the country's reopening is safe, effective, and gets americans back to work. tune in:  "
1629,2020-06-17,<JoeBiden>," the truth of our nation is that too often the color of your skin alone can endanger your life and, for far too long, systemic racism has oppressed communities of color in the united states.  it has to change.
"
1630,2020-06-16,<JoeBiden>," we need a president who chooses unity over division.
"
1631,2020-06-16,<JoeBiden>," i’ve said it before, and i’ll say it again: donald trump is running the most corrupt administration in modern american history.
"
1632,2020-06-16,<JoeBiden>," we have the power to write the future we want for this country. one where health care is a right, we lead the world in the fight against climate change, we end our gun violence epidemic, and our government works for all — not just the powerful.  let’s do it together.
"
1633,2020-06-16,<JoeBiden>," we can’t forget that in the middle of a global pandemic, the trump administration is trying to gut obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. it's morally reprehensible.
"
1634,2020-06-16,<JoeBiden>," systemic racism pervades every part of our society, including law enforcement — and we have to do the hard work to root it out. in january, i sat down with jake, a field organizer on our campaign, to listen to what he had to say and discuss how we can move forward:  "
1635,2020-06-16,<JoeBiden>," this virus won’t just go away because you want it to, mr. president. it’s time for you to step up and do your job.
"
1636,2020-06-15,<JoeBiden>, los dreamers son estadounidenses. trump les quitó la protección que lograron con tanto esfuerzo. esto es inaceptable. el primer día de mi presidencia enviaré un proyecto de ley al congreso que protegerá a los beneficiarios de daca de la deportación.  
1637,2020-06-15,<JoeBiden>," lgbtq+ rights are human rights. period.
"
1638,2020-06-15,<JoeBiden>," folks, i’ve got some big news: next week, i’m getting together with my friend and former boss, president  for a virtual grassroots fundraiser. we would love to see you there.   chip in now to get your ticket:  "
1639,2020-06-15,<JoeBiden>," dreamers are americans. but trump's ripped away the hard-won protections of daca recipients, throwing their lives into upheaval. it’s unacceptable, and on day one of my presidency i will protect them from deportation and send a bill to congress.  "
1640,2020-06-15,<JoeBiden>," i wish i could say this hate began with donald trump and will end with him. it didn’t, and it won’t. american history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.   it's up to all of us to do the hard work to ensure the american ideal finally wins out.  "
1641,2020-06-15,<JoeBiden>," i'm grateful for  support and proud to stand with them in this fight. as president, i’m going to do everything in my power to expand access to quality, affordable health care — including reproductive health care.
"
1642,2020-06-15,<JoeBiden>," donald trump is not responsible for covid-19, but he does bear full responsibility for his slow, uncoordinated, bungled response.  "
1643,2020-06-15,<JoeBiden>, race-neutral policies are not a sufficient response to race-based disparities. we need to tackle systemic racism head-on and ensure everyone has a fair shot at the american dream.  here’s what i would do as president:  
1644,2020-06-15,<JoeBiden>, today's decision is another step in our march toward equality for all. the supreme court has confirmed the simple but profoundly american idea that every human being should be treated with respect. but we're not done.  
1645,2020-06-14,<JoeBiden>," after reports of wealthy trump donors getting millions in relief meant for small businesses, the administration is now refusing to disclose where the ppp money went. it's unacceptable.  the american people deserve answers.  "
1646,2020-06-14,<JoeBiden>," in every corner of the country, people are raising their voices and demanding justice. it gives me so much hope.  together, we’re going to transform this nation and ensure justice finally rings out for all.
"
1647,2020-06-14,<JoeBiden>," we need a president who heals — not one who fans the flames of hate.   we need a president who unites — not one who sows further discord for political gain.   we need a president who leads the way with a steady hand — not one who incites violence with his erratic tweets.
"
1648,2020-06-14,<JoeBiden>," we’re facing some of the greatest challenges in our nation’s history — and it’s clear donald trump isn’t up for the job.  we need real leadership, right now.
"
1649,2020-06-14,<JoeBiden>," we have to ensure every worker called back on the job has access to regular, reliable covid-19 testing and effective personal protective equipment.  "
1650,2020-06-13,<JoeBiden>," we need a president who will fight to further lgbtq+ equality — not roll back the hard-won progress we've already made.
"
1651,2020-06-13,<JoeBiden>, we need real policing reform — and we need it now.  
1652,2020-06-13,<JoeBiden>," our nation is at an inflection point. we can't go back to the way things were before — we have to take a bold step forward and usher in a new era of equality and opportunity.  we can do it, together.
"
1653,2020-06-13,<JoeBiden>, here's my promise to you: i will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our nation — not use them for political gain.  we shouldn’t accept anything less from an american president.  
1654,2020-06-13,<JoeBiden>," we need a national ban on chokeholds. now.
"
1655,2020-06-13,<JoeBiden>," i’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. that is truer today than ever. if we give donald trump eight years in the white house, he will fundamentally alter the character of this nation.   we can’t let that happen.
"
1656,2020-06-12,<JoeBiden>," in light of donald trump's inhumane reversal of protections for transgender people, i want to share a conversation i had a few weeks ago. adi deserves to be treated with the same respect and dignity as anyone else. period.  "
1657,2020-06-12,<JoeBiden>," on the fourth anniversary of pulse. in the middle of pride month. during a global pandemic.  donald trump's cruelty truly knows no bounds. we have to defeat him this november.
"
1658,2020-06-12,<JoeBiden>," two years after trump's singapore meeting with north korean dictator kim jong un, the u.s. and our allies are less safe and kim's arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles keeps growing. photo-ops and love letters are no substitute for deterrence and principled diplomacy.
"
1659,2020-06-12,<JoeBiden>," medgar evers once said, ""freedom has never been free."" on this day in 1963, he paid the ultimate price in pursuit of freedom for his brothers and sisters. he was gunned down fighting to end racial injustice. we must honor him by carrying forward that cause in our own lives today.
"
1660,2020-06-12,<JoeBiden>," four years ago today, 49 lives were cut short in an act of unspeakable terrorism at pulse nightclub. as we remember those we lost — including so many in the lgbtq+ and hispanic communities — we have to double down on our efforts to #honorthemwithaction.  "
1661,2020-06-12,<JoeBiden>," we need real policing reform, and we need it now. congress should immediately:  - outlaw chokeholds - improve oversight and accountability - create a model use of force standard - stop the transfer of weapons of war to local police forces
"
1662,2020-06-12,<JoeBiden>," donald trump forgot about covid-19, but covid-19 didn’t forget about us.   the president couldn’t wish away the virus in april, he couldn’t tweet it away in may, and he can’t ignore it away in june.
"
1663,2020-06-12,<JoeBiden>, our country is crying out for leadership that donald trump can’t deliver.  
1664,2020-06-11,<JoeBiden>," we need a president who chooses hope over fear.
"
1665,2020-06-11,<JoeBiden>, we can't let history repeat itself — facebook needs to act now to stop the spread of disinformation and protect our elections. watch my deputy campaign manager kate bedingfield break down what's happening and how you can help us fix it:  
1666,2020-06-11,<JoeBiden>," covid-19 can affect anyone, anywhere — but it doesn't impact every community equally. watch as dr. ebony jade hilton explains how it’s impacting communities of color:  "
1667,2020-06-11,<JoeBiden>," while the president was spiking the football and taking a victory lap, another 1.5 million americans filed new unemployment claims last week.   he is completely oblivious to what's really happening in this country — and hardworking americans are paying the price.
"
1668,2020-06-11,<JoeBiden>," we have to ensure our economic reopening is safe and strong — and builds the foundation for an economy that works for everyone. today, i'm releasing my plan to make that happen:  "
1669,2020-06-11,<JoeBiden>," we have to make sure our economic reopening is safe, effective, and gets americans back to work. tune in for a roundtable discussion on how we can make that happen:  "
1670,2020-06-11,<JoeBiden>," we have to make sure our economic reopening is safe, effective, and gets americans back to work. tune in for a roundtable discussion on how we can make that happen:  "
1671,2020-06-11,<JoeBiden>," with less than 150 days until election day, the stakes couldn't be higher. we've got to fix facebook to protect our democracy and ensure fair elections.   if you agree, sign the open letter today to demand facebook take action. #movefastfixit  "
1672,2020-06-11,<JoeBiden>," so far, facebook has failed to enact any real reforms to stop the spread of disinformation on its platform. time is running out.   today, we're releasing an open letter demanding the company change its policies:  "
1673,2020-06-11,<JoeBiden>," folks, we saw in 2016 what can happen when social media platforms are left unchecked and allow disinformation to run rampant. it puts the very integrity of our elections at risk.   we simply cannot let it happen again in 2020.
"
1674,2020-06-11,<JoeBiden>," it's in our darkest moments that we've produced some of our greatest progress — and we have that opportunity once again. let's make this a moment of action to address systemic racism and propel our nation into an era of true equality and opportunity.
"
1675,2020-06-10,<JoeBiden>," there is systemic racism not just in our law enforcement but also in housing, education, and everything we do — and we have to do the hard work to end it.  "
1676,2020-06-10,<JoeBiden>, we have to make this an era of action — starting with real police reform. no more excuses. no more delays.   add your name to demand congress ban chokeholds — and pass real police reform — right now:  
1677,2020-06-10,<JoeBiden>," this pandemic isn't just going to go away because you want it to, mr. president. step up and do your job before your negligence costs even more lives than it already has.  "
1678,2020-06-10,<JoeBiden>, ignore the polls. we can't take anything for granted this november — the stakes are simply too high.   register to vote:  
1679,2020-06-10,<JoeBiden>," nothing about the fights we're facing will be easy. racism has been a fixture in our society for hundreds of years.    but i’m ready to get to work on day one. we can’t accept anything less from an american president.
"
1680,2020-06-10,<JoeBiden>," donald trump’s hate-filled, conspiracy-laden rhetoric is inflaming the racial divides in our country—but just fixing the way the president talks won’t cut it. we need to root out systemic racism and ensure black americans have a real shot to get ahead.  "
1681,2020-06-10,<JoeBiden>," america was founded on the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all. we’ve never fully lived up to that promise — and we can’t rest until we finally do.
"
1682,2020-06-09,<JoeBiden>," from ballot shortages and issues with machines to hours-long lines — what happened today in georgia should enrage us all. we need to act now to prevent it from happening again in november. our democracy depends on it.
"
1683,2020-06-09,<JoeBiden>," because of donald trump's negligence and incompetence:   - more than 110,000 people have died - we have nearly 2 million cases of covid-19 - over 20 million americans are out of work   and yet he’s patting himself on the back. unbelievable.
"
1684,2020-06-09,<JoeBiden>, small businesses like rafael's are the backbone of communities all across this nation. we have to do so much more to help them through this crisis.  
1685,2020-06-09,<JoeBiden>," let me be clear: we can't leave this moment and once again turn away and do nothing.   we need justice. we need action. we need reform.
"
1686,2020-06-09,<JoeBiden>, grief is a heavy burden to bear — and it's even harder with the eyes of the world watching. i know. but that burden is now a purpose — to change the world for the better in the name of george floyd.  that's the message i shared with his loved ones during today's service:  
1687,2020-06-09,<JoeBiden>," my dad used to say there's no greater sin than the abuse of power.  whether it's an officer bloodying a peaceful protester or a president defending him with a conspiracy theory he saw on tv.  i'm a catholic – just like martin. our faith says that we can't accept either.
"
1688,2020-06-09,<JoeBiden>," 13 million people who had jobs when you took office are unemployed today.
"
1689,2020-06-09,<JoeBiden>," together, let’s make this an era of action.  "
1690,2020-06-08,<JoeBiden>," this moment is a wake-up call for all of us. it's long past time we deal with systemic racism, growing economic inequality, and the denial of the promise of this nation to so many.  "
1691,2020-06-08,<JoeBiden>," donald trump inherited the longest economic expansion in history from the obama-biden administration, but like everything else he’s inherited, he has squandered it.  "
1692,2020-06-08,<JoeBiden>," to everyone speaking out and peacefully demanding justice across the nation: i see you, i hear you, and i stand with you.  "
1693,2020-06-08,<JoeBiden>," at every turn, president trump ignored the experts, downplayed the threat covid-19 posed, and misled the american people — and we’re all paying the price every single day.  "
1694,2020-06-08,<JoeBiden>," we've made incredible progress on lgbtq+ equality, but we still have further to go. we can't rest until everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law—regardless of who they are or whom they love.  join #outforbiden and let's get to work:  "
1695,2020-06-08,<JoeBiden>," we're facing some of the greatest challenges in our history, and donald trump is patting himself on the back. he just has no idea what’s really going on in this country.   it's time for him to step out of his bunker and look around at the consequences of his words and actions.
"
1696,2020-06-08,<JoeBiden>," american history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending. but we have the power to write the future we want for this nation.  don't let anyone tell you differently.
"
1697,2020-06-07,<JoeBiden>," donald trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this moment.
"
1698,2020-06-07,<JoeBiden>, our nation is at an inflection point. we can choose four more years of donald trump's poisonous rhetoric and divisive politics — or we can take the next great step forward.  
1699,2020-06-07,<JoeBiden>, these disparities have plagued our nation for far too long. it’s time we rebuild our country upon more just and equal foundations — and finally close race-based wealth and income gaps.  
1700,2020-06-07,<JoeBiden>, we need to build an economy that rewards work — not just wealth.  
1701,2020-06-07,<JoeBiden>," this isn’t about politics. this is about the future of our country. grateful for your support, secretary powell.
"
1702,2020-06-07,<JoeBiden>," the words of a president matter. and time and time again, donald trump has callously used his to incite violence, stoke the flames of hatred and division, and drive us further apart.   we cannot give him another four years in the white house.
"
1703,2020-06-06,<JoeBiden>," we need to stand up as a nation — with the black community and with all minority communities — and come together as one america. because the pain is too immense for one community to bear alone.   it is the duty of every american to grapple with it — and grapple with it now.
"
1704,2020-06-06,<JoeBiden>," i promised george floyd's family that he wouldn’t just become another hashtag — and i intend to keep that promise.   we need justice. and we need real police reform to ensure this never occurs again.
"
1705,2020-06-06,<JoeBiden>," to all those families who are scared, and hurting, and wondering what’s going to happen next: i want you to know i see you. i won’t ever forget you. and i won’t be satisfied until this economy starts working for all of you.  "
1706,2020-06-06,<JoeBiden>," today, we honor those who answered duty’s call on june 6, 1944, on the beachheads of normandy. we must be a living memorial to their bravery and sacrifice—and recognize always that our strength is rooted in our fervid and unfailing defense of democratic rights and freedoms. #dday
"
1707,2020-06-06,<JoeBiden>," today, the pain is so raw it can be hard to keep faith that justice is at hand or that we will ever achieve the more perfect union we all want. but ours is a union worth fighting for, and we are all called to the cause.   no one can stay silent.  "
1708,2020-06-06,<JoeBiden>," we're just 150 days out from election day, and the stakes have never been higher. we have to defeat donald trump, and once we do, we won’t just rebuild this country — we'll transform it. together.   help us make it happen:  "
1709,2020-06-06,<JoeBiden>," donald trump was warned, but he failed to act. now more than 20 million americans are out of a job and paying the price. it didn’t have to be this bad.  "
1710,2020-06-05,<JoeBiden>," folks, tonight we secured the 1,991 delegates needed to win the democratic nomination. i'm going to spend every day fighting to earn your vote so that, together, we can win the battle for the soul of this nation.  "
1711,2020-06-05,<JoeBiden>," tonight, i’m thinking of breonna taylor’s mother, tamika palmer. today should have been her daughter's birthday. i've talked a lot about turning pain into purpose. but for breonna and tamika, it’s on us to find purpose. our country needs to act — now.  "
1712,2020-06-05,<JoeBiden>, donald trump still doesn’t get it. he’s out there spiking the football — completely oblivious to the tens of millions of people who are facing the greatest struggle of their lives.  
1713,2020-06-05,<JoeBiden>," this #gunviolenceawarenessday, i am reflecting on the life of hadiya pendleton, whose murder inspired the #wearorange movement.  the hard truth is that black americans are ten times more likely to die by gun homicide. it has to stop.
"
1714,2020-06-05,<JoeBiden>," when it comes to this economic crisis, donald trump either doesn’t know what’s going on, or he just doesn’t care.  "
1715,2020-06-05,<JoeBiden>, donald trump is dangerously unfit to lead our nation through this moment. but don't just take my word for it:  
1716,2020-06-05,<JoeBiden>," let’s be clear about something: the depth of this job crisis is not attributable to an act of god — but to the failure of a president.
"
1717,2020-06-05,<JoeBiden>," george floyd’s last words, “i can’t breathe,” have echoed across our nation and around the world.  for the president to try to put any other words in his mouth is frankly despicable.
"
1718,2020-06-05,<JoeBiden>, tune in as i speak about the latest jobs report and the state of the economy:  
1719,2020-06-05,<JoeBiden>," those who have worked the closest with donald trump know how unfit he is to serve as president.
"
1720,2020-06-05,<JoeBiden>," it is long past time we made the promise of this nation real for all of our people.
"
1721,2020-06-04,<JoeBiden>," we are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us.   we are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us.   we are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us.
"
1722,2020-06-04,<JoeBiden>," we can’t take four more years of this.
"
1723,2020-06-04,<JoeBiden>," to everyone struggling with mental health—you're not alone. there is no shame in seeking help, and there shouldn't be any barriers in your way to getting that help.   together, we can achieve mental health parity, expand access to care, and wipe out the stigma.  "
1724,2020-06-04,<JoeBiden>," it's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, i’ll do my job and take responsibility. i won’t blame others. and i’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you.
"
1725,2020-06-04,<JoeBiden>," we are at our best when we open our hearts, not when we clench our fists.
"
1726,2020-06-04,<JoeBiden>," jim mattis and i haven’t always agreed on everything, but you'd be hard pressed to find a more powerful indictment of trump's actions and character than the one he's written.  ""we do not need to militarize our response to protests. we need to unite around a common purpose.""
"
1727,2020-06-04,<JoeBiden>," i wish i could say this hate began with donald trump and will end with him. it didn’t, and it won’t. american history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.  it's up to all of us to create the america we know we can be.  "
1728,2020-06-04,<JoeBiden>," more than 42 million americans have now filed for unemployment in the last three months, and black and latino communities are being hit hardest.  "
1729,2020-06-03,<JoeBiden>, there’s no time to waste — we need to get to work immediately on real police reform. congressman  has a bill to outlaw chokeholds. congress should put it on president trump’s desk in the next few days. period.  
1730,2020-06-03,<JoeBiden>," the nation is crying out for leadership — but this president has nothing to offer.
"
1731,2020-06-03,<JoeBiden>," donald trump has turned our country into a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears. he thinks division helps him.  i ask every american to look at where we are now, and think anew: is this who we are? is this who we want to be?  "
1732,2020-06-03,<JoeBiden>, we need a president who listens.  
1733,2020-06-03,<JoeBiden>, it’s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we’ve made some of our greatest progress — and we have that chance once again. we’re not just going to rebuild this nation — we’re going to transform it.   there is nothing we can’t do if we do it together.  
1734,2020-06-03,<JoeBiden>," if we stand together, we will rise stronger than before. a more equal, more just, more hopeful nation — closer to that more perfect union we must always strive to be.
"
1735,2020-06-03,<JoeBiden>," i ask all of america — not to deny our pain or cover it over — but to use it to compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity for our great democracy.
"
1736,2020-06-02,<JoeBiden>," if the senate has time to confirm donald trump’s unqualified judicial nominees, it has time to pass legislation that will give true meaning to our constitution’s promise of equal protection under the law.  no more excuses. no more delays.
"
1737,2020-06-02,<JoeBiden>," when 100,000 americans died because of his incompetent leadership, this president golfed.  when americans peacefully protested outside the white house, this president tear-gassed them for a photo-op.  donald trump was elected to serve us all — but he only looks out for himself.
"
1738,2020-06-02,<JoeBiden>, the presidency is a big job. nobody will get everything right. i won’t either.  but i promise you this: i won’t traffic in fear and division or fan the flames of hate. i will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country — not use them for political gain.  
1739,2020-06-02,<JoeBiden>," that’s what the presidency is: a duty of care — to all of us, not just our voters, not just our donors, but all of us.  "
1740,2020-06-02,<JoeBiden>, “i can’t breathe.”   george floyd’s last words. but they didn’t die with him. they’re still being heard. they’re echoing across this nation.   it’s a wake-up call for all of us.  
1741,2020-06-02,<JoeBiden>," julián — i made a promise to george's family that he wouldn't just become another hashtag. we're going to tackle this head on — and we're going to need your help to do it. grateful for your support.
"
1742,2020-06-02,<JoeBiden>," i’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation.  who we are. what we believe. and maybe most important—who we want to be. it’s all at stake.   that is truer today than ever. and it’s in this urgency we can find the path forward.
"
1743,2020-06-02,<JoeBiden>," the president held up a bible at st. john’s church yesterday. if he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something:   that we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves.   that’s hard work. but it’s the work of america.
"
1744,2020-06-02,<JoeBiden>," a country is crying out for leadership. leadership that can unite us, leadership that brings us together, leadership that can recognize the pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time.
"
1745,2020-06-02,<JoeBiden>," let us vow to make this, at last, an era of action to reverse systemic racism with long overdue and concrete changes.  this morning i'm speaking in philadelphia, pennsylvania on where we are and where we need to go. tune in:  "
1746,2020-06-01,<JoeBiden>," pride is a global movement of love, self-expression, and community — resilient in the face of oppression and fear and hopeful for a better future. this month, let us recommit to those principles and remain steadfast in the fight for justice and equality.  "
1747,2020-06-01,<JoeBiden>," he's using the american military against the american people.  he tear-gassed peaceful protesters and fired rubber bullets.  for a photo.  for our children, for the very soul of our country, we must defeat him. but i mean it when i say this: we can only do it together.
"
1748,2020-06-01,<JoeBiden>," in this moment, the very soul of america is at stake.   we must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being.   we have to finally make real the american promise: that all men and women are not only equal at creation, but throughout their lives.
"
1749,2020-06-01,<JoeBiden>," after another night of unrest in america, i’m hosting a virtual roundtable with mayors from across the country to discuss where we go from here. tune in:  "
1750,2020-05-31,<JoeBiden>," we are a nation in pain right now, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us.   as president, i will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, i will listen, just as i did today visiting the site of last night's protests in wilmington.  "
1751,2020-05-30,<JoeBiden>," we are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. we are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. please stay safe. please take care of each other.  "
1752,2020-05-30,<JoeBiden>," trump’s tantrum diplomacy is eroding u.s. credibility on the international stage. withdrawing from  during a global pandemic is a recipe for disaster and increases the cost of the american response. we must instead rally the world to confront covid-19.
"
1753,2020-05-30,<JoeBiden>," if we are complacent, if we are silent, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence.  none of us can turn away. we all have an obligation to speak out.
"
1754,2020-05-30,<JoeBiden>," you can't defeat bigotry; it only hides. and when leaders give it oxygen — as donald trump has done — it comes roaring back.  we all have a moral obligation to stand up, speak out, and hold people accountable.  "
1755,2020-05-30,<JoeBiden>," today, in lifting our ambitions and our imaginations to the heavens, the united states has once more reshaped the future of space travel.  "
1756,2020-05-30,<JoeBiden>," every day that donald trump spends in the white house, he further debases the values and ideals of our nation. he is wholly unfit to be president.  "
1757,2020-05-29,<JoeBiden>," this is no time for incendiary tweets. this is no time to encourage violence.  this is a national crisis — and we need real leadership right now.
"
1758,2020-05-29,<JoeBiden>," we are a country with an open wound.  none of us can turn away. none of us can be silent. none of us any longer can hear those words — “i can’t breathe” — and do nothing.  we must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being.  "
1759,2020-05-29,<JoeBiden>," it’s time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.  it’s time for us to face the deep, open wound we have in this nation.  we need justice for george floyd.
"
1760,2020-05-29,<JoeBiden>, tune in as i address the unfolding situation in minnesota and the killing of george floyd:  
1761,2020-05-29,<JoeBiden>," i will be speaking more about the events in minnesota later today.
"
1762,2020-05-29,<JoeBiden>," i will not lift the president’s tweet. i will not give him that amplification. but he is calling for violence against american citizens during a moment of pain for so many. i’m furious, and you should be too.
"
1763,2020-05-29,<JoeBiden>," this is not abstract: a black reporter was arrested while doing his job this morning, while the white police officer who killed george floyd remains free. i am glad swift action was taken, but this, to me, says everything.
"
1764,2020-05-28,<JoeBiden>," we can’t allow this crisis to exacerbate the disparities that plague our nation.
"
1765,2020-05-28,<JoeBiden>," we’re months into this crisis, and donald trump still doesn't have an effective national testing strategy.   i do:  "
1766,2020-05-28,<JoeBiden>, ordinary people doing extraordinary things. that's the story of america — and we’re seeing it written every single day. it gives me hope.  
1767,2020-05-28,<JoeBiden>," 100,000+ lives lost across the country. 1,700,000+ confirmed u.s. cases. 40,000,000+ unemployment claims filed.  donald trump has failed our nation.
"
1768,2020-05-28,<JoeBiden>," today, we learned that another 2.1 million people filed for unemployment last week, bringing the total number of new claims since this crisis began to more than 40 million. it's just the latest evidence of donald trump’s utter failure of leadership.  "
1769,2020-05-28,<JoeBiden>," thirty years ago, i proudly cosponsored the landmark americans with disabilities act. it was an enormous step forward, but there's more work to do. so today, i’m releasing my plan to achieve full participation and equality for people with disabilities:  "
1770,2020-05-28,<JoeBiden>," the hard truth is that this crisis didn’t have to be this bad.
"
1771,2020-05-28,<JoeBiden>, two tweets from the same day in october.  
1772,2020-05-27,<JoeBiden>, every day donald trump proves how unfit he is to lead our nation.  
1773,2020-05-27,<JoeBiden>," presidents are supposed to lead by example — and every day donald trump proves how incapable he is of doing that.
"
1774,2020-05-27,<JoeBiden>, george floyd’s life mattered.  
1775,2020-05-27,<JoeBiden>," . and i are saddened to learn of the passing of larry kramer, an american hero. through his activism, larry taught us all how to speak up and demand our government do its job. his outspokenness raised our consciousness on hiv/aids and saved countless lives.
"
1776,2020-05-27,<JoeBiden>," there are moments in our history so grim, so heart-rending, that they're forever fixed in each of our hearts as shared grief. today is one of those moments. 100,000 lives have now been lost to this virus.  to those hurting, i'm so sorry for your loss. the nation grieves with you.  "
1777,2020-05-27,<JoeBiden>," over the last few months, countless asian americans have been threatened, attacked, and blamed for covid-19. they've cruelly been made the scapegoat by the most powerful man on the planet, president trump. it has to end.  read more from  and me:  "
1778,2020-05-27,<JoeBiden>," we’re in the middle of a global pandemic — and not only is donald trump preventing people from getting the health insurance they need, but he’s also actively trying to terminate the insurance millions already have.  it’s morally reprehensible.
"
1779,2020-05-27,<JoeBiden>, tune in now as  joins me for a conversation on how covid-19 is impacting states:  
1780,2020-05-27,<JoeBiden>," this morning, i’ll be joined by  for a conversation on how covid-19 is making an impact on states.   tune in live at 10:30am edt:  "
1781,2020-05-26,<JoeBiden>," last year california passed #ab5, affording gig workers protections and benefits like a minimum wage and overtime pay.  now, gig economy giants are trying to gut the law and exempt their workers. it's unacceptable.  i urge californians to vote no on the initiative this november.
"
1782,2020-05-26,<JoeBiden>," george floyd deserved better and his family deserves justice. his life mattered.  i'm grateful for the swift action in minneapolis to fire the officers involved — they must be held responsible for their egregious actions. the fbi should conduct a thorough investigation.
"
1783,2020-05-26,<JoeBiden>," donald trump's wealthy donors got tens of millions of dollars in relief, while countless small businesses were turned away. it's no wonder he didn't want any oversight.  we need a government that works for all — not just the super-wealthy.
"
1784,2020-05-26,<JoeBiden>," the truth is asking for money is the worst part of running for president—especially in times as tough as these. but we’re coming up on our end of month fundraising deadline, and i need your help to ensure we hit our goal.  if you can, please chip in today:  "
1785,2020-05-26,<JoeBiden>," 1 in 4 u.s. workers has filed for unemployment benefits in the last 10 weeks. it’s a crisis unlike anything we’ve seen in our lifetime — and the trump administration is failing to do enough to help.
"
1786,2020-05-26,<JoeBiden>," folks, today we’re launching #league46⚾️ — a next generation coalition ready to make donald trump a one-term president. we've got unlimited capacity to create change — and together, we’re going to transform this country.  join today:  "
1787,2020-05-26,<JoeBiden>," so much of this could have been prevented if we had a president who listened to someone other than himself.
"
1788,2020-05-26,<JoeBiden>," we are months into this crisis, and donald trump still doesn't have a comprehensive plan when it comes to covid-19 or the economy. it's unacceptable. i released a detailed plan laying out what i would do months ago, and have built on it since. take a look:  "
1789,2020-05-25,<JoeBiden>," there’s not a single thing the american people can’t do if we do it together.
"
1790,2020-05-25,<JoeBiden>," we have always been able to take crises and turn them into opportunities — and we have the chance to do that once again. if we match our ambitions to the scale of the challenges we face, we can and will transform our country for generations to come.
"
1791,2020-05-25,<JoeBiden>," this ruling goes a long way toward protecting the sacred right to vote, but there's still work to do. we've got to ensure everyone — including individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies — has the right to make their voice heard at the ballot box.
"
1792,2020-05-25,<JoeBiden>," to all the members of our military and our military families, especially those who have lost their service member, thank you. we owe you. we can never lessen the magnitude of your loss, but this i can promise you: we will never forget. #memorialday  "
1793,2020-05-24,<JoeBiden>," the presidency is about a lot more than tweeting from your golf cart. it requires taking on the ultimate responsibility for the biggest decisions in the world. donald trump simply wasn’t prepared for that. i promise you i will be.
"
1794,2020-05-24,<JoeBiden>," climate change poses an existential threat to our future — and time is running out to address it. we have to get donald trump out of the white house and tackle the challenge head-on.
"
1795,2020-05-24,<JoeBiden>," hunger today isn’t about scarcity — it’s about a massive failure in leadership.   if i were president, i’d immediately work with  to empower our restaurants to be part of the solution as families go hungry during the covid-19 crisis.  "
1796,2020-05-24,<JoeBiden>," we’re in the middle of a global pandemic, and the trump administration is trying to prevent people from getting health care.  "
1797,2020-05-24,<JoeBiden>," folks write letters to me asking all kinds of questions, but jack's question on my favorite ice cream flavor might be the best one yet.  here’s what i told him:  "

1800,2020-05-23,<JoeBiden>," as ramadan draws to an end,  and i want to wish a safe and warm celebration to our muslim friends and neighbors. even though we can't be all together to celebrate, we hope it is filled with joy, family, and success for the year to come. #eidmubarak
"
1801,2020-05-23,<JoeBiden>, donald trump has failed to live up to our trust and treaty obligations to native americans. it’s unacceptable.  i’ll make meaningful investments in indian country — including increasing funding for indian health services and making that funding mandatory.  
1802,2020-05-23,<JoeBiden>," we can protect the sacred right to vote and protect public health at the same time.
"
1803,2020-05-23,<JoeBiden>," the hard truth is donald trump ignored the warnings of health experts and intelligence agencies, downplayed the threat covid-19 posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak.  it’s one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history.
"
1804,2020-05-23,<JoeBiden>," 36,000 americans could be alive today if president trump had acted sooner. let's put that into perspective:  "
1805,2020-05-23,<JoeBiden>," we're in the midst of the worst economic crisis in our lifetime, and senate republicans continue to delay relief for the american people saying, ""i don’t see the need right now."" unbelievable.  we've got to take back the senate this november.  "
1806,2020-05-22,<JoeBiden>, adi is an incredible young advocate for the transgender community. he also graduated high school today. we wanted to say congrats...with a couple friends!  
1807,2020-05-22,<JoeBiden>, chip in to help make it happen:  
1808,2020-05-22,<JoeBiden>, no worker’s life is worth getting a cheaper hamburger. period.  
1809,2020-05-22,<JoeBiden>, think of how many small businesses could have been helped with the $47 million that went to private jet companies owned by wealthy trump donors. it’s ridiculous.  we need a president who puts hardworking americans ahead of the wealthy and well-connected.  
1810,2020-05-22,<JoeBiden>," we will get through this, and we will come out stronger. i promise.  "
1811,2020-05-22,<JoeBiden>," in announcing the intent to withdraw from the open skies treaty, president trump has doubled down on his short-sighted policy of going it alone and abandoning american leadership.  "
1812,2020-05-22,<JoeBiden>," i've said it before, and i'll say it again: no company pulling in billions of dollars in profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers.  it's time for amazon to pay its fair share.  "
1813,2020-05-22,<JoeBiden>, join andrew yang to discuss the economic impact of covid-19. tune in now:  
1814,2020-05-22,<JoeBiden>," in the middle of this crisis, president trump is trying to cut food assistance. it’s morally bankrupt.  we should do everything in our power to ensure no one goes hungry in america.
"
1815,2020-05-22,<JoeBiden>, a president who can't handle a crisis is no president at all.  
1816,2020-05-21,<JoeBiden>," it didn’t have to be this bad. the hard truth is that donald trump failed to take action, and it cost american lives.  "
1817,2020-05-21,<JoeBiden>," turns out, it takes more than a tweet to implement a comprehensive national testing strategy.
"
1818,2020-05-21,<JoeBiden>, i’m looking forward to joining my friend  on the  tonight. check out some of my favorite moments from the last time i was on his show — and then make sure to tune in to cbs at 11:35 pm et.

1820,2020-05-21,<JoeBiden>, donald trump’s inaction cost lives.  
1821,2020-05-21,<JoeBiden>," while we hope to soon return to some sense of normalcy in our lives, we cannot allow ourselves to return to the everyday gun violence that has plagued our past. we need to pass common-sense reforms and end our gun violence epidemic.
"
1822,2020-05-21,<JoeBiden>, i promise you this: a biden administration will listen to scientists and heed their advice — not silence them.  
1823,2020-05-21,<JoeBiden>," when i launched my campaign, i said we were in a battle for the soul of the nation — we’re seeing that soul on full display. folks are reaching out to help one another and doing truly heroic things. it makes me so proud.
"
1824,2020-05-20,<JoeBiden>, this shouldn’t be a partisan issue. we need to ensure every single eligible american can safely make their voice heard this november.  
1825,2020-05-20,<JoeBiden>, we don't have a food shortage problem — we have a leadership problem.  
1826,2020-05-20,<JoeBiden>," donald trump is using a global health crisis as an excuse to deport children and continue separating families. it's heartless and un-american. people across the political spectrum rejected these policies before, and will do so again, because they know families belong together.
"
1827,2020-05-20,<JoeBiden>," folks, i’m excited to share that we’re hosting a grassroots fundraiser with  grassroots donors are the backbone of our campaign — and i want to thank you for all your support.  chip in any amount to join us friday afternoon:  "
1828,2020-05-20,<JoeBiden>," my heart and jill's go out to the people of midland, michigan, experiencing another crisis in the midst of this pandemic.  "
1829,2020-05-20,<JoeBiden>," donald trump needs to do his job and implement a national testing strategy.
"
1830,2020-05-20,<JoeBiden>," from my home in delaware to milwaukee, wisconsin — join us for a virtual rally at 3:30 pm ct:  "
1831,2020-05-20,<JoeBiden>," donald trump has failed to provide for our nurses and doctors on the frontlines. now he’s short-changing our troops and their families. unacceptable.
"
1832,2020-05-20,<JoeBiden>," now more than ever, we need a president who will choose to unite rather than divide.
"
1833,2020-05-20,<JoeBiden>," when we emerge from this crisis, we can’t just go back to the way things were before. we need to take this country to a place we’ve never been. where we finally live up to our highest ideals and everyone gets a full share of the american dream.
"
1834,2020-05-19,<JoeBiden>," congratulations to dr.  on the start of her second term. taiwan’s thriving democracy and response to covid-19 are an example to the world. america’s support for taiwan must remain strong, principled, and bipartisan.
"
1835,2020-05-19,<JoeBiden>," the united states of america has always emerged stronger from every trial and tribulation — and we will again. we will overcome this.
"
1836,2020-05-19,<JoeBiden>," fundamentally, this is about whose side the government is on and whether it is accountable to the american people. this is a case i will continue to make, and if elected president will deliver on.  "
1837,2020-05-19,<JoeBiden>," that's exactly why  and i have called for more oversight. we need more conditions on corporations to ensure relief goes to their workers, not their ceos. no $500 billion slush fund. no blank checks. the trump administration is prioritizing big corporations over workers.
"
1838,2020-05-19,<JoeBiden>," during today’s senate banking committee hearing, secretary  refused to require corporations benefiting from $500 billion in cares act funds to keep workers on their payrolls.  asked him several times, each time he ducked and refused.
"
1839,2020-05-19,<JoeBiden>," today,  and i are mourning the death of our dear friend, annie glenn. her long life was filled with great love and great meaning, with purpose and her own brand of uncommon courage.  "
1840,2020-05-19,<JoeBiden>," tonight, i'll be joining  for a virtual town hall to discuss the impact of covid-19 on food security and the restaurant industry — and what our government should be doing to ensure no one in america goes hungry.  watch live at 7 pm et:  "
1841,2020-05-19,<JoeBiden>, donald trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this crisis.  
1842,2020-05-19,<JoeBiden>," we need a president who believes in science.
"
1843,2020-05-19,<JoeBiden>," i am proud to stand with  in calling for a strong osha standard for rns and other frontline health care workers and full utilization of the defense production act to mass produce personal protective equipment.
"
1844,2020-05-19,<JoeBiden>," it’s time we reward the people who actually make this country work. not wall street ceos — but the middle class. ordinary women and men who are capable of doing extraordinary things when given half a chance.  that's who i'll fight for every single day in the white house.
"
1845,2020-05-18,<JoeBiden>," donald trump is not responsible for the coronavirus. but he does bear full responsibility for failing to protect our nation from the worst public health and economic crisis in our lifetime.
"
1846,2020-05-18,<JoeBiden>," with your help, we'll defeat donald trump. and we won't just rebuild this nation — we’ll transform it. i know times are tough, but if you're able, please chip in today to help make it happen:  "
1847,2020-05-18,<JoeBiden>," one of president trump's top advisors admitted that this administration ""really let the country down"" on testing.  he's right. it's long past time for trump to step up and implement a national testing strategy so we can begin safely reopening the economy.  "
1848,2020-05-18,<JoeBiden>," - expand vote-by-mail and early voting - implement online voter registration - ensure everyone can safely vote in-person  we need to do everything in our power to ensure every american can safely make their voice heard this november.
"
1849,2020-05-18,<JoeBiden>," companies getting relief from taxpayers have an obligation to protect workers' paychecks, and the trump administration has an obligation to hold their feet to the fire to ensure they do.  we need real relief paired with real oversight—not no-strings-attached corporate bailouts.
"
1850,2020-05-18,<JoeBiden>," donald trump is the most corrupt president in modern american history — and his recovery efforts are making that clearer than ever.
"
1851,2020-05-18,<JoeBiden>," in the middle of the worst public health crisis in our lifetime, president trump is actively trying to terminate health insurance for millions of americans. it's unthinkable.  here's what i would do to ensure everyone has access to the coverage they need:  "
1852,2020-05-17,<JoeBiden>," in times of crisis, americans stand as one. it's who we are. and it's how we're going to get through this — together.
"
1853,2020-05-17,<JoeBiden>," a year ago today, the house passed the #equalityact, a long-overdue bill that would ensure lgbtq+ people are treated with dignity and respect under the law. but  won't bring it up for a vote. it's unacceptable.  passing it will be a top legislative priority of mine.
"
1854,2020-05-17,<JoeBiden>, i'm incredibly grateful for everyone who has chipped in to help fuel this campaign — especially in times as tough as these.  and i called a few folks to thank them for their support:  
1855,2020-05-17,<JoeBiden>," as we reflect on the incredible legacy of brown v. board of education, we’re reminded of the urgent work that remains before us 66 years later. we can’t rest until every kid gets a fair shot, and we finally live up to our founding ideals of liberty, justice, and equality for all.
"
1856,2020-05-17,<JoeBiden>," moments of crisis require presidents to step up, transcend partisan politics, and unite the nation to achieve a common goal. but donald trump has done nothing but stoke division—and we're seeing the effect every day. he is the worst possible person to lead us through this crisis.
"
1857,2020-05-17,<JoeBiden>," no graduating class gets to choose the world into which they graduate, but few have ever entered at a point in this country's history where they genuinely have a chance to write a new chapter.  congratulations to the class of 2020, i can't wait to see the future you create.  "
1858,2020-05-17,<JoeBiden>," behind every covid-19 death is a family and a community that will never be the same.  behind every unemployment claim is a life thrown into uncertainty — a person wondering how they’ll make ends meet.  there is a real human toll to this crisis. we cannot forget that.
"
1859,2020-05-17,<JoeBiden>," today, on the international day against homophobia, transphobia and biphobia, i stand with lgbtq+ people and their allies to celebrate and champion the inherent dignity and worth of all persons—regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. #idahotb  "

"
1861,2020-05-16,<JoeBiden>," from this moment of crisis, we have the opportunity to not just rebuild our economy — but transform it.
"
1862,2020-05-16,<JoeBiden>, every day donald trump proves how wholly unfit he is to lead our country.  
1863,2020-05-16,<JoeBiden>, we need a president who puts hardworking americans ahead of the wealthy and well-connected.  
1864,2020-05-16,<JoeBiden>," defeating donald trump is going to take everything we've got. his campaign has been preparing for the last four years and has millions in the bank. i know times are tough, but if you can, please pitch in today to help us catch up:  "
1865,2020-05-16,<JoeBiden>," on this armed forces day,  and i want to express our gratitude and support for the men and women in uniform — serving and defending our country around the world. thank you for your selfless service and sacrifice. you continue to make us proud.  "
1866,2020-05-16,<JoeBiden>," it seems the way to get fired by president trump is not to commit wrongdoing, but to investigate it.
"
1867,2020-05-15,<JoeBiden>," the fact is donald trump wasted an awful lot of time, and lives were lost as a consequence.  "
1868,2020-05-15,<JoeBiden>," i want donald trump to look the american people in the eye and explain why their hard-earned dollars are bailing out his wealthy donors.
"
1869,2020-05-15,<JoeBiden>," we're building a campaign that will defeat donald trump and transform this nation — but we need your help to do it. join us this sunday for a grassroots strategy summit, where we'll lay out our path to victory and how you can get involved:  "
1870,2020-05-15,<JoeBiden>," unions like  are supporting their workers and communities during this pandemic. to build a stronger, more inclusive, and more resilient middle class after this crisis, we must encourage unionization. that starts with enacting the pro act.  "
1871,2020-05-15,<JoeBiden>," los fracasos internacionales de trump han abierto el camino para que cuba se una al consejo de derechos humanos de la onu. esto traiciona a los presos políticos en cuba y mina aún más la diplomacia de los ee.uu. como presidente, defenderé los derechos humanos del pueblo cubano.
"
1872,2020-05-15,<JoeBiden>," trump's international failures have cleared a path for cuba to join the un human rights council. this would betray cuba's political prisoners and further undermine u.s. diplomacy. as president, i will lead by empowering the cuban people and defending human rights.
"
1873,2020-05-15,<JoeBiden>," to everyone who has lost a loved one due to covid-19: i know it's incredibly difficult right now, but there will come a time when their memory brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye. it will take time, but that’s when you know you’re going to make it.

"
1876,2020-05-15,<JoeBiden>," to all of our front line workers who are working day in and day out to keep our nation afloat during this crisis, thank you.
"
1877,2020-05-14,<JoeBiden>," we are months into this crisis. there is simply no excuse for president trump's failure to implement a national testing strategy.
"
1878,2020-05-14,<JoeBiden>," tonight,  and i will be joining  for a discussion on combating covid-19 and how we can ensure everyone can make their voice heard this november.  tune in to  at 10 pm et to watch live.
"
1879,2020-05-14,<JoeBiden>," donald trump can deflect and shift blame all he wants, but the hard truth is he failed to protect our nation from the worst public health and economic crisis in our lifetime.  "
1880,2020-05-14,<JoeBiden>," sherian, a small business owner from south carolina, recently asked how i would help businesses like hers recover from this crisis and how we can tackle health care disparities among communities of color. they're important questions. here's what i said:  "
1881,2020-05-14,<JoeBiden>," the lives of tens of millions of americans have been thrown into chaos through no fault of their own — and donald trump simply isn't doing enough to help them.
"
1882,2020-05-14,<JoeBiden>," join me for a virtual roundtable on covid-19 with governors gretchen whitmer, phil murphy and ned lamont who are at the forefront of this crisis:  "
1883,2020-05-14,<JoeBiden>, small businesses are the backbone of this country. we have to do so much more to support them through this crisis. here's what i would do if i were president:  
1884,2020-05-14,<JoeBiden>," with the void of leadership in the white house, governors across the country have stepped up to meet this moment. this afternoon, i’ll be joined by a few of them for a roundtable discussion on covid-19.   tune in at 3:30 pm et to watch:  "
1885,2020-05-14,<JoeBiden>," as the economy continues to spiral downwards and unemployment soars to great depression-era levels, we cannot ignore the hard truth: this crisis hit us harder and will take longer to recover from because of donald trump’s failures.  "
1886,2020-05-14,<JoeBiden>," there's nothing that the american people cannot accomplish when we stand together — one nation, united in purpose.
"
1887,2020-05-13,<JoeBiden>, happy birthday to the one and only   
1888,2020-05-13,<JoeBiden>," “60 days into the coronavirus crisis, the white house does not have a plan, a framework, a philosophy, or a goal.”  real presidents lead. reality tv presidents don’t.  "
1889,2020-05-13,<JoeBiden>," not only does the trump administration want to take away health coverage for millions in the middle of a pandemic, but now they want to let people go hungry, too. their cruelty truly knows no bounds.  "
1890,2020-05-13,<JoeBiden>," moments of crisis require swift and decisive action from our leaders, but donald trump and his administration have done nothing but dither and delay. they have failed the american people on every single front.
"
1891,2020-05-13,<JoeBiden>," i would trust the guy who’s one of our nation's top public health experts, not the one who pondered injecting disinfectant into the body and looked directly at a solar eclipse.
"
1892,2020-05-13,<JoeBiden>," enough with the anger and division and fear-mongering, mr. president. it's time for you to step up, appeal to our better angels, and unite the country. we'll overcome this crisis by coming together — not by tearing each other apart.
"
1893,2020-05-13,<JoeBiden>, it didn’t have to be this bad. donald trump utterly failed to prepare for this pandemic and delayed in taking the necessary steps to safeguard our nation against the near-worst-case-economic scenario we are now living.  
1894,2020-05-13,<JoeBiden>, we owe so much to every single worker on the front lines of this crisis. the least we can do is provide them the pay and protection they need and deserve. here's what i would do if i were president:  
1895,2020-05-13,<JoeBiden>, i joined  on  good luck america to discuss everything from memes to stimulus oversight. head to  
1896,2020-05-13,<JoeBiden>, a united party is key to winning the white house this november. the work of the task forces will be essential to identifying ways to build on our progress and not simply turn the clock back to a time before donald trump — but transform our country.  
1897,2020-05-13,<JoeBiden>," donald trump can put up all of the banners he wants in the rose garden, but it doesn’t change the fact that he failed our nation when it comes to covid-19 testing.  "
1898,2020-05-12,<JoeBiden>, i wish the president would spend less time talking and tweeting and more time listening to experts like dr. fauci. this isn’t politics. this is life and death.  
1899,2020-05-12,<JoeBiden>," . and i are saddened to learn of the passing of aimee stephens. we send our deepest condolences to her wife, donna, and her family. aimee's spirit and courage will not only be her legacy but our guiding light as we carry on her fight for equality.  "
1900,2020-05-12,<JoeBiden>," the trump administration clearly knows what's needed to make workplaces safe and operational: adequate testing, contact tracing, masks, and additional precautions.  they're putting in the work to keep themselves safe. why aren't they doing the same for the american people?
"
1901,2020-05-12,<JoeBiden>," this is a bunch of malarkey and you know it,  we left a 69-page playbook on how to fight pandemics.  you can read it here if you’d like:  "
1902,2020-05-12,<JoeBiden>, donald trump knew about this crisis all the way back in january — and his response since has been incompetent at best.  
1903,2020-05-12,<JoeBiden>," here's the deal: we can choose who our country works for. we can choose whether it works for just the wealthy — or everyone else as well.  that’s the choice we must make — all of us together — this november.
"
1904,2020-05-12,<JoeBiden>," let me be clear: my administration will review every single stimulus loan given to big companies and political insiders. we will find any dollar taken corruptly, we will come get it, and we will punish the wrongdoers.  "
1905,2020-05-11,<JoeBiden>," i believe everyone deserves a fair shot at success — not just the mar-a-lago crowd.
"
1906,2020-05-11,<JoeBiden>, donald trump just doesn't understand: we have an economic crisis because we have a public health crisis — and we have a public health crisis because he failed to act.  
1907,2020-05-11,<JoeBiden>," in april, we raised $60.5 million between my campaign and  i'm humbled and know what a sacrifice it is to give in times as difficult as these. but may is our most important month yet, and we need your help. if you can, please chip in today:  "
1908,2020-05-11,<JoeBiden>," donald trump and his team seem to understand how critical testing is to their own safety. so why are they insisting that it’s unnecessary for the american people?
"
1909,2020-05-11,<JoeBiden>," with folks staying at home during this time of social distancing, we put together some fun activities to keep everyone entertained. text free to 30330 to be the first to get a look at what we’ve been working on.  "
1910,2020-05-11,<JoeBiden>," donald trump hopes to split us into dueling camps, casting democrats as doomsayers hoping to keep america grounded and republicans as freedom fighters trying to liberate the economy.  it’s a childish tactic—and a false choice none of us should fall for.  "
1911,2020-05-11,<JoeBiden>," i have a better idea: give people coronavirus economic relief and don't hold their hard-earned benefits hostage.
"
1912,2020-05-11,<JoeBiden>," this crisis presents an opportunity to not just rebuild our economy — but transform it.  joined me to discuss how we can do that and create a stronger, fairer, more inclusive middle class.  listen to the full episode:  "
1913,2020-05-10,<JoeBiden>," no podemos callar ante la violencia contra personas transgénero de color, como las recientes tragedias en missouri y puerto rico. es nuestra obligación garantizar que todos puedan vivir abiertamente, con orgullo y sin miedo.  "
1914,2020-05-10,<JoeBiden>," we cannot be silent in the face of rising violence against transgender people of color—like the recent tragedies in missouri and puerto rico. it's our moral obligation to end this epidemic, and ensure everyone can live open and proud and free from fear.  "
1915,2020-05-10,<JoeBiden>," . and i covered a lot of ground on the next episode of here's the deal, but the most surprising part might have been learning about his connection to the roosevelts.  make sure to tune in for the full episode tomorrow morning:  "
1916,2020-05-10,<JoeBiden>," don't let anyone tell you differently: we have the power to write the future we want for our country.
"
1917,2020-05-10,<JoeBiden>, tax cuts for the super-wealthy. bailouts for large corporations. working americans left behind.  that’s donald trump’s record.  
1918,2020-05-10,<JoeBiden>," i believe rebuilding the middle class is the moral obligation of our time. we have to build a stronger, more inclusive, more resilient middle class — one that can withstand the next public health crisis or whatever else comes our way.
"
1919,2020-05-10,<JoeBiden>," ordinary people, given half a chance, have never let their country down.  that’s who i believe in. that’s who i’m in this race to fight for.
"
1920,2020-05-10,<JoeBiden>," to the extraordinary mothers everywhere, like catherine eugenia finnegan biden, my wishes for a safe and happy mother’s day.  "
1921,2020-05-09,<JoeBiden>," there's a clear choice this november:  donald trump will do everything he can to terminate health care for millions in a global pandemic.  i will do everything i can to ensure every american has access to the quality, affordable care they need.  "
1922,2020-05-09,<JoeBiden>," there’s no quit in america. none at all. we’re going to get through this — and we're going to come out stronger.
"
1923,2020-05-09,<JoeBiden>, no one should pay a dollar out of pocket for coronavirus testing or treatment. period.  
1924,2020-05-09,<JoeBiden>, imagine what we could be doing now with the $2 trillion in tax cuts that donald trump delivered for his rich friends.  
1925,2020-05-09,<JoeBiden>," we need to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. and this time, we're going to bring everyone along.  we have to make sure every single person gets a fair shot at success.
"
1926,2020-05-09,<JoeBiden>, crisis reveals character — and character belongs in the white house.  
1927,2020-05-08,<JoeBiden>, ahmaud arbery was shot down in cold blood. his family deserves justice — and they deserve it now.  
1928,2020-05-08,<JoeBiden>," make no mistake: covid-19 has caused a massive economic challenge. but this crisis hit us harder, and will last longer, because donald trump spent the last three years undermining the core pillars of our economic strength.  "
1929,2020-05-08,<JoeBiden>," two years ago, donald trump withdrew from the iran deal. this week, he vetoed a war powers resolution that would've prevented him from starting a war with iran without congressional consent. his decisions have increased the risk of war in the middle east.  "
1930,2020-05-08,<JoeBiden>," corruption is a feature of donald trump's economic agenda—not a bug. he will pick his wealthy friends and corporate cronies over working families every time.  i say it’s time we pick a different way—one where everyone gets a fair shot at success, not just the mar-a-lago crowd.  "
1931,2020-05-08,<JoeBiden>," 75 years ago on #veday, america and its allies defeated fascism in europe. from the devastation of war, we built a lasting peace. today, as we honor the veterans who sacrificed for us, let us remember the importance of uniting against common threats.
"
1932,2020-05-08,<JoeBiden>," it didn’t have to be this bad. the hard truth is that donald trump was simply not up to the job.
"
1933,2020-05-08,<JoeBiden>, i’m the proud husband of a teacher who inspires me every day. i’ve seen firsthand how hard teachers work with little support and few resources. thank you to all the amazing teachers who've inspired and educated the future of our country. #teacherappreciationweek  
1934,2020-05-08,<JoeBiden>, wouldn't it be nice to have a president who listens to someone other than himself?  
1935,2020-05-08,<JoeBiden>," donald trump loves to crow about what a great economy he built.  this crisis has revealed what a failure trumponomics has been. and american workers and families are paying the price.   tune in for my remarks live on  at 12 pm edt.
"
1936,2020-05-08,<JoeBiden>," here's the simple truth: the united states of america has never been defeated when we're together — and we're not going to be defeated now.  we can and will overcome this.
"
1937,2020-05-07,<JoeBiden>," i can't hit the campaign trail in-person due to covid-19 — so instead, i’m traveling across the country from my home in delaware. head over to my instagram to catch up on today’s trip to florida 📲.
"
1938,2020-05-07,<JoeBiden>," where are the tests, mr. president?
"
1939,2020-05-07,<JoeBiden>," every step of the way, president trump has ignored the experts, downplayed the threat covid-19 posed, and misled the american people — and we’re all paying the price every single day.  i promise you, i will do the opposite.
"
1940,2020-05-07,<JoeBiden>," over 33 million americans have filed unemployment claims since mid-march — one out of every five workers. it’s a national economic disaster that requires urgent action. we have to get help to everyone who needs it — efficiently, equitably, and immediately.  "
1941,2020-05-07,<JoeBiden>, real presidents lead. reality tv presidents don’t.  
1942,2020-05-07,<JoeBiden>, i believe the moral obligation of our time is to rebuild our economy in a way that finally brings everyone along. a biden administration will encourage the economic empowerment of african americans and close the racial wealth and income gaps.  read more:  
1943,2020-05-07,<JoeBiden>, these folks are true heroes — every single one of them.  take a minute to read their stories:  
1944,2020-05-06,<JoeBiden>," we can't host any in-person events due to covid-19, but that won't stop me from hitting the campaign trail—virtually, of course. tomorrow, i'll be making stops around florida and wrapping up the day with a virtual rally in tampa.  tune in at 5:15 pm et:  "
1945,2020-05-06,<JoeBiden>," i’ve said it before, and i’ll say it again: no one is expendable. no life is worth losing to add one more point to the dow.
"
1946,2020-05-06,<JoeBiden>," the nurses on the front lines of this crisis are american heroes. we owe them more than we could ever repay, but we can start by ensuring they have the protective equipment they need to stay safe, emergency paid sick leave, and premium pay. #nationalnursesday
"
1947,2020-05-06,<JoeBiden>," you heard it straight from the president himself: he wants to terminate health care for millions of americans in the middle of a global pandemic.  we can't let that happen.
"
1948,2020-05-06,<JoeBiden>," the stakes in this election have never been higher. over the last few months, we've seen how wholly unfit donald trump is to lead our nation.  we have to vote him out of the white house this november.
"
1949,2020-05-06,<JoeBiden>," we can’t sit by as donald trump and republicans use covid-19 as an excuse to disenfranchise voters. we need to ensure people have the opportunity to vote by mail, early vote, vote absentee and, in every way possible, safely vote in person this november.  "
1950,2020-05-06,<JoeBiden>," today, amid the covid-19 pandemic, the trump-backed lawsuit to dismantle the aca enters a new phase. if trump and republican ags succeed, it’ll mean devastation for our health care system that will cause untold pain and suffering. we can't let that happen.  "
1951,2020-05-06,<JoeBiden>, these stories are heartbreaking and remind us that the numbers we see in the news are more than just statistics. every death is a tragedy and marks a family and community that will never be the same.  and i are keeping them all in our prayers.   
1952,2020-05-05,<JoeBiden>," the video is clear: ahmaud arbery was killed in cold blood. my heart goes out to his family, who deserve justice and deserve it now. it is time for a swift, full, and transparent investigation into his murder.
"
1953,2020-05-05,<JoeBiden>, this didn't have to happen. the trump administration failed to take action and produce desperately needed protective equipment — and those on the front lines of this crisis paid the price. it's heartbreaking.  
1954,2020-05-05,<JoeBiden>," the biden administration will not silence scientists.
"
1955,2020-05-05,<JoeBiden>," the choice between the economy and public health is a false one—if we don’t beat the virus, we'll never get back to full economic strength and will lose countless lives. we have to get the number of new cases down and scale up testing before we return to some sense of normalcy.
"
1956,2020-05-05,<JoeBiden>," it’s important to stay connected while we’re social distancing — but there’s always that one friend who doesn’t get the hint when it’s time to end the video chat.   glad we don’t know anyone like that — right,   "
1957,2020-05-05,<JoeBiden>," it's been a big few weeks. president obama, secretary clinton, senator sanders, senator warren, and speaker pelosi all endorsed our campaign. now, we need your help to keep the momentum going.  i know times are tough, but if you can, please chip in today:  "
1958,2020-05-05,<JoeBiden>," each week, i get hundreds of letters from people across the country. folks share their hopes, ideas, struggles, and concerns — and i try to respond to as many as i can. we're going to share a few of them with you in our new series: sincerely, joe.  "
1959,2020-05-05,<JoeBiden>," thank you to all the:  firefighters paramedics police officers doctors nurses medical support staff grocery and retail workers meatpackers delivery drivers transit workers and everyone else on the front lines of this fight.  you truly are the heart and soul of this country.
"
1960,2020-05-04,<JoeBiden>," let me be clear: essential workers on the front lines of this crisis deserve premium pay, emergency paid sick leave, and protections that keep them safe.
"
1961,2020-05-04,<JoeBiden>," across the country, folks are stepping up, taking care of their neighbors, and lending a hand to those in need. it's who we are. in times of crisis, we stand as one. and it makes me so proud to be an american.
"
1962,2020-05-04,<JoeBiden>," today, i’m releasing a new plan to achieve equity for the african american community and take us one step closer to making america what it ought to be. read more:  "
1963,2020-05-04,<JoeBiden>," over 1 million cases of covid-19. almost 70,000 dead. what is upsetting president trump? tough questions from the press.  cry me a river, mr. president.  "
1964,2020-05-04,<JoeBiden>," make no mistake: we can emerge from this crisis a stronger, better, and fairer nation. it’s within our power — we just need a president and an administration who are up for the task.
"
1965,2020-05-04,<JoeBiden>," i've always believed that we've been at our best when we've acted as one america. this crisis is an opportunity for us to be that nation again. there's not a single thing we cannot accomplish if we do it together.
"
1966,2020-05-03,<JoeBiden>," in times of crisis, the american people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. donald trump has not been that president.  "
1967,2020-05-03,<JoeBiden>," the hard truth is that it didn’t have to be this bad. the lack of preparation, the slow response on testing, the failure to administer the relief in the cares act appropriately — all of it stems from donald trump’s failures as president.  "
1968,2020-05-03,<JoeBiden>," this sunday night, settle in and join labor leader dolores huerta, actor john leguizamo, secretary hilda solis, and congresswoman escobar for a #todosconbiden discussion. tune in now:  "
1969,2020-05-03,<JoeBiden>," the american people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. we can and will overcome this — together.
"
1970,2020-05-03,<JoeBiden>," donald trump seems to think he can direct funding based on which politicians are nice to him, which states he’s trying to win in november, and which businesses he wants to enrich — all without any accountability.  and i think that’s unacceptable.  "
1971,2020-05-03,<JoeBiden>," this #worldpressfreedomday, support for an independent press at home and around the world matters more than ever. we must vote trump out this november and assure that attacks on our free press are never again acceptable — especially not in the white house.  "
1972,2020-05-03,<JoeBiden>," trump deflects legitimate questions with attacks. he bullies members of the press, instead of taking responsibility for his failures. his efforts to undermine public confidence in the integrity of reporting violate our core values and threaten our very system of government.
"
1973,2020-05-03,<JoeBiden>," a free press is essential to a free society. that's why attacking the press and attempting to intimidate independent media is a standard part of the authoritarian playbook around the world. and it’s why donald trump’s efforts to demonize the media put us on such a dangerous path.
"
1974,2020-05-03,<JoeBiden>, the u.s. postal service is an essential pillar of american life. we simply cannot let donald trump destroy it.  
1975,2020-05-03,<JoeBiden>," over the last few weeks, i worked with our supporters and staff to create a code for our campaign—the principles we’ll live by, reflecting the community we’ve built, the team we aspire to be, and some of my own ‘rules’ as well.  i’m excited to share it:  "
1976,2020-05-02,<JoeBiden>," this pandemic is bigger than any one individual or country. this moment requires all of us to come together — across the nation and around the world — to solve this crisis.
"
1977,2020-05-02,<JoeBiden>," when i say donald trump is the most corrupt president in modern american history, this is what i'm talking about.  monty bennett should return the tens of millions of dollars he received, and we should give it to the small businesses that need it.
"
1978,2020-05-02,<JoeBiden>," we left a playbook. he ignored it.  we created an office to prepare for pandemics. he gutted it.  we had cdc officials in china to detect and contain outbreaks. he pulled them out.  trump can try and shift blame all he wants, but the fact is his actions left us unprepared.
"
1979,2020-05-02,<JoeBiden>," mi corazón y el de jill están con puerto rico a raíz de los terremotos de hoy. mientras la isla enfrenta el impacto de este suceso y la pandemia del covid-19 tenemos que asegurarnos que reciban los recursos y la asistencia que necesitan para recuperarse lo más pronto posible.
"
1980,2020-05-02,<JoeBiden>," my heart and jill's are with the people of puerto rico in the wake of another damaging earthquake. as the island grapples with both the impact of this earthquake and this pandemic, we need to ensure they get the resources and assistance needed to recover as soon as possible.
"
1981,2020-05-02,<JoeBiden>," to  don’t give up this fight. this is not over yet.  to  equal pay, now. or else when i'm president, you can go elsewhere for world cup funding.
"
1982,2020-05-02,<JoeBiden>," on march 6th, donald trump said: “anybody that wants a test can get a test.”  it was a lie then, and it's still not true nearly two months later. it's a disgrace, and it's slowing efforts to reopen safely.  this administration needs to act immediately to surge testing nationwide.
"
1983,2020-05-01,<JoeBiden>," when we come together and act as one america, there's not a single thing we cannot accomplish.
"
1984,2020-05-01,<JoeBiden>, no one should have to pay for coronavirus treatment. period.  
1985,2020-05-01,<JoeBiden>," i'll say what donald trump won't: the confederate flag, swastikas, and other symbols of hate that have been used in these protests have no place in america. the president should encourage folks to follow gov. whitmer’s public health orders — not sow further discord and division.
"
1986,2020-05-01,<JoeBiden>," as we mark the beginning of asian pacific american heritage month,  and i extend our best wishes to aanhpi communities across america. we look forward to celebrating your extraordinary accomplishments and contributions in the month ahead.
"
1987,2020-05-01,<JoeBiden>," when we emerge from this crisis, we can't just go back to the way things were before. we have to build a better future for all.  we can and will transform this nation — together.
"
1988,2020-05-01,<JoeBiden>," this crisis isn't about you, mr. president. it's about the american people.  "
1989,2020-05-01,<JoeBiden>," we have lived long enough with a president who doesn’t think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. that’s not me. as a presidential candidate, i’m accountable to the american people.  "
1990,2020-04-30,<JoeBiden>, we need a president who listens.  
1991,2020-04-30,<JoeBiden>, we need more tests. our front line workers need protective equipment. americans need additional economic relief.  yet the trump administration is spending time and energy on president trump's wasteful border wall.  unbelievable.  
1992,2020-04-30,<JoeBiden>," the number is overwhelming, but each one represents a life thrown into uncertainty, a family unable to make ends meet, and a community worried about how it will recover.  we have to do more to help them. now.
"
1993,2020-04-30,<JoeBiden>," - more than 60,000 people in the u.s. have died - 30 million have filed for unemployment - at least 1 million have gotten sick  enough with the late night twitter tantrums, mr. president. it's time for you to step up and lead.
"
1994,2020-04-30,<JoeBiden>," instead of preparing our country to fight covid-19, donald trump wasted months and promised it would miraculously go away by april.  he was wrong. and we're all paying the price.  "
1995,2020-04-30,<JoeBiden>," an open and independent press is more important than ever in times like this. they deserve to be treated with respect — not belittled with schoolyard taunts from this president.
"
1996,2020-04-30,<JoeBiden>," donald trump either read his daily briefings and ignored the warnings, or didn't read them at all. either way, it's a complete and unjustifiable dereliction of duty.
"
1997,2020-04-30,<JoeBiden>, i’ve been a big fan of megan’s for years and can’t wait to join her this afternoon. you can watch our chat live at 2:45 pm et:  
1998,2020-04-30,<JoeBiden>," we may be physically apart, but we are all in this together.  "
1999,2020-04-30,<JoeBiden>," as president, i promise you i'll honor all those we've lost from covid-19.  "
2000,2020-04-30,<JoeBiden>," the climate emergency isn't just a threat to our environment, it's a threat to our health, economy, and so much more. we have to get donald trump out of the white house and take action to combat it before it's too late.
"
2001,2020-04-29,<JoeBiden>," in the middle of a global pandemic, the trump administration is still working to gut the affordable care act and rip health care away from millions. it's morally reprehensible.  they need to drop the lawsuit immediately.  "
2002,2020-04-29,<JoeBiden>," with rent due in a few days and folks across the country worried they won't be able to make their payments, it's clear more needs to be done to provide relief. we need to freeze rent immediately for people who have lost their jobs and place a temporary ban on evictions.
"
2003,2020-04-29,<JoeBiden>," the words of a president matter — and donald trump has used his to downplay covid-19, pass blame onto others, and mislead the american people. i will do the opposite.  "
2004,2020-04-29,<JoeBiden>," the trump admin failed to provide enough testing, ppe, and safety enforcement. workers have gotten sick, plants have closed, and the meat supply is at risk. it's past time workers have the protections they need to stay healthy and do their job safely.  "
2005,2020-04-29,<JoeBiden>," ""i wish he were president right now, but i can't wait until he is if all of us do our part to support the kind of person that we want back in the white house."" —   join us:  "
2006,2020-04-29,<JoeBiden>," wear a mask in public. read your daily briefings. listen to the experts.  this really isn't rocket science. it's common sense.
"
2007,2020-04-29,<JoeBiden>," throughout our history, we have emerged from every crisis stronger than before — and we will again.
"
2008,2020-04-29,<JoeBiden>," we owe a profound debt of gratitude to the health care workers on the front lines of this fight. i checked in with monica, an icu nurse, to talk about how she's getting through this and to thank her for all she's doing:  "
2009,2020-04-29,<JoeBiden>," i couldn't agree with  more. we need a president who will listen to the science, bring us together, and lead with compassion and heart. if i have the honor of being elected, that's the exact kind of president i will be.  "
2010,2020-04-28,<JoeBiden>," there are nearly 330 million people in the united states — and according to the trump white house, we've only conducted 5.4 million covid-19 tests. it's abysmal.  donald trump needs to scale up testing, and he needs to do it immediately.
"
2011,2020-04-28,<JoeBiden>," let me be very clear: no one is expendable.  we shouldn’t allow rationing of health care that discriminates based on age or disability.
"
2012,2020-04-28,<JoeBiden>," the fact is there has been so much unnecessary death in this country. if we had listened to the experts and heeded their warnings, it could have been stopped short. but donald trump failed to act — and now the american people are paying the price.  "
2013,2020-04-28,<JoeBiden>," i’ve known  for years, and know that her dedication and passion for bettering our country are second to none. i’m grateful for her endorsement and for her friendship — and look forward to working alongside her to get donald trump out of the white house.  "
2014,2020-04-28,<JoeBiden>," covid-19 is affecting the entire nation, but the impact doesn’t look the same for everyone. i'm hosting a town hall on how covid-19 is impacting women — and i'll be joined by special guest hillary clinton. tune in now to watch:  "
2015,2020-04-28,<JoeBiden>," if you're excited too, join us at 3 pm et:  "
2016,2020-04-28,<JoeBiden>," we're months into this crisis and workers still don't have enough protective equipment, there still aren't enough tests, and the death toll continues to rise.  the president should spend less time congratulating himself and more time doing his job.  "
2017,2020-04-28,<JoeBiden>," we are months into this crisis, and health care workers still don’t have the protective equipment they need. it’s a national disgrace.  "
2018,2020-04-27,<JoeBiden>," tomorrow afternoon, i'll be hosting a town hall on how covid-19 is impacting women — and i'll be joined by a special guest. tune in at 3 pm et to watch:  "
2019,2020-04-27,<JoeBiden>," the trump administration could have helped prevent this. but once again, they failed to take action — and now the american people are paying the price.
"
2020,2020-04-27,<JoeBiden>," testing is the springboard we need to help get our economy safely up and running again. trump could rapidly scale it up. he hasn’t. instead, he’s passed blame and pushed sole responsibility to governors.  we've got to do better.  "
2021,2020-04-27,<JoeBiden>," covid-19 is a danger to everyone. we will stop it by coming together as one america — not by targeting others.  thank you for helping lead this fight, "
2022,2020-04-27,<JoeBiden>, join senator kamala harris and symone sanders for a town hall addressing the impact and disparities of covid-19 in the black community. tune in now:  
2023,2020-04-27,<JoeBiden>," covid-19 can hit anyone, anywhere — but it doesn’t affect every community equally. this afternoon, join senator  and  for a discussion on its disproportionate impact on communities of color.  tune in at 3:30 pm et:  "
2024,2020-04-27,<JoeBiden>," we want our country to get moving and healthy again. but we must take the necessary, rational steps, grounded in science, to do so safely, so covid-19 doesn’t come roaring back.  "
2025,2020-04-27,<JoeBiden>," i'm incredibly honored by  endorsement and grateful for her historic leadership in congress.   together, we helped pass obamacare and together we can not only bring this country back from the brink from this current crisis, but transform it.
"
2026,2020-04-26,<JoeBiden>," america has always met every big challenge with an even bigger solution — this moment should be no different. we need an infrastructure program that will combat climate change and create good-paying jobs at the same time.
"
2027,2020-04-26,<JoeBiden>," wealthy firms with ties to trump got millions, while countless small businesses were turned away. no wonder he wanted no one to watch how the money was deployed.  the american people deserve rigorous oversight — and small businesses deserve relief. now.  "
2028,2020-04-26,<JoeBiden>," the american people are stepping up and rising to meet this moment. it's time for our president to do the same.
"
2029,2020-04-26,<JoeBiden>," now more than ever, we need a president who will choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction.  "
2030,2020-04-26,<JoeBiden>," imagine the future we can build with donald trump out of the white house. a future where:  - health care is a right - we combat climate change - we end our gun violence epidemic - our government works for all — not just the powerful  let’s build that future, together.
"
2031,2020-04-26,<JoeBiden>, the workers on the front lines of this crisis are risking their lives every day to combat covid-19 and keep this country running. the least we can do is provide them the pay and protection they need and deserve.  
2032,2020-04-25,<JoeBiden>," 366 days ago, we launched this campaign.  192 days from now, we’ll beat donald trump.  let’s go win this thing, together.  "

"
2040,2020-04-25,<JoeBiden>," it’s stories like these that make me so proud to be an american and make me confident that we will overcome this. because there’s nothing the american people have been unable to accomplish when we do it together.
"
2041,2020-04-25,<JoeBiden>," after seeing the shortage of masks around the country, marilyn decided to step up and organize efforts in northern virginia to make homemade masks. because of her selfless work, countless front line workers have the masks they need to stay safe.
"
2042,2020-04-25,<JoeBiden>," older adults are especially vulnerable to covid-19. recognizing that, erica decided to organize youth in her community to buy groceries for seniors — ensuring they receive the food they need while staying safe at home. she's a true hero.

"
2060,2020-04-23,<JoeBiden>," the words of a president matter — never more than in times of crisis. a president should seek to calm and heal, provide a steady hand, and a clear path forward.  instead, this is what we get from donald trump:  "
2061,2020-04-23,<JoeBiden>, donald trump will always put his wealthy and well-connected friends first — that should come as no surprise. but to allow the banks to do it on the backs of small business owners in the middle of a global pandemic is a new low — even for him.

2082,2020-04-21,<JoeBiden>," the right to vote is the most fundamental american right there is. we need to immediately expand vote-by-mail, online voter registration, and early voting to ensure everyone can safely exercise their right to participate in our electoral process.  "

2103,2020-04-19,<JoeBiden>," at a time when studies are linking air pollution with covid-19 mortality rates for the most vulnerable in our society, the trump administration is rolling back environmental protections — allowing more poison into our air.  "

2113,2020-04-17,<JoeBiden>," donald trump is not responsible for covid-19, but he is responsible for our slow, uncoordinated response.  experts say that if we had acted two weeks earlier, more lives could have been saved.  trump failed to take swift action—and we're paying the price.  "
2114,2020-04-17,<JoeBiden>, president trump is trying to rewrite history when it comes to china and covid-19 — but the facts don't back him up. tony blinken was the deputy secretary of state and is one of my top foreign policy advisors. he'll explain.

2127,2020-04-15,<JoeBiden>," we won’t defeat this president by being like him. we’ll win by doing the opposite. where he seeks to divide us, we’ll connect people. where he shows cruelty, we’ll show compassion. and when he fights, we’ll fight harder. but we can’t do it without you.
"
2128,2020-04-15,<JoeBiden>," mayor  campaign had a set of “rules of the road” that helped define the character of his campaign and his supporters. i think it’s a good idea, and one i’d like  to adopt.

"
2142,2020-04-14,<JoeBiden>," leadership is about never proclaiming power. it’s about collaboration, it’s about coming together in a crisis and finding common ground. it’s about results.    that’s who i am and the role i aspire to fulfill in guiding this democratic nation to better times.
"
2143,2020-04-14,<JoeBiden>," i am not running for office to be king of america. i respect the constitution. i’ve read the constitution. i’ve sworn an oath to it many times. i respect the great job so many of this country’s governors — democratic and republican — are doing under these horrific circumstances.

"
2147,2020-04-13,<JoeBiden>," for months, the trump administration was repeatedly warned about the threat covid-19 posed to our nation. they ignored the experts, failed to take action, and now americans are paying the price.  "

2165,2020-04-11,<JoeBiden>, president trump needs to do everything in his power to expand the number of testing sites and surge the number of tests. mass testing is key to reopening the economy and finding a way out of this crisis.  
2166,2020-04-10,<JoeBiden>," the american people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. there's nothing we can't do if we do it together.
"
2167,2020-04-10,<JoeBiden>, no one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a global pandemic. we need to freeze rent for people who lose their jobs and place a ban on evictions immediately.  
2168,2020-04-10,<JoeBiden>, we need a president who demonstrates the leadership to address every aspect of this pandemic  —  including the spate of racist incidents targeting asian americans and pacific islanders  —  with urgency and seriousness. donald trump is not that president.  
2169,2020-04-10,<JoeBiden>, the folks on the front lines of this crisis are american heroes.  
2170,2020-04-10,<JoeBiden>," la historia de los ee.uu. es la historia de gente común que hace cosas extraordinarias. sé que unidos, y como una nación, nosotros somos más fuertes que este virus. sé que superaremos esto y seremos más fuertes por ello, se lo prometo. no pierdan la fe.  "
2171,2020-04-10,<JoeBiden>, the health inequities being exposed by covid-19 are unconscionable.  we can do better. we have to.  
2172,2020-04-10,<JoeBiden>," whether you supported bernie or any other candidate throughout the primary, know that there is a home for you in our campaign. you're not just welcome — you're needed. and i will do everything i can to earn your vote this november.
"
2173,2020-04-10,<JoeBiden>," america’s story is one of ordinary people doing extraordinary things given half a chance. this virus is tough. but together and as a nation — we're tougher.  i know we’ll get through this and we’ll be stronger for it, i promise you. keep the faith.  "
2174,2020-04-09,<JoeBiden>," the stakes in this election have never been higher. we have to come together and beat donald trump.
"
2175,2020-04-09,<JoeBiden>," this virus can hit anyone — regardless of race, economic status, or access to power — but it doesn’t impact every community equally. it hits hardest those who are most vulnerable and who have the fewest resources.  we have to do better for all our people.  "
2176,2020-04-09,<JoeBiden>," the devastating unemployment numbers have made one thing even clearer: we need a fourth coronavirus relief package, and we need it fast. we need to take extraordinary steps to protect american families and ensure those laid off are made financially whole.
"
2177,2020-04-09,<JoeBiden>," this morning's news of another rise in unemployment claims—on top of the millions already filed—is devastating. we have to make sure those affected get the benefits they deserve, but we can't stop there.  i'm announcing two new policies to help americans get the relief they need:  "
2178,2020-04-09,<JoeBiden>," i can't believe i have to say this, but we should be expanding the number of testing sites and surging the number of tests — not reducing them. testing is key to finding a way out of this crisis.
"
2179,2020-04-09,<JoeBiden>," we have to do more to ease the economic burden on working people. so today, i'm adopting two new policies to help deliver relief. as president, i will:  - lower medicare eligibility to age 60 - forgive student debt for low-income and middle class families  "
2180,2020-04-09,<JoeBiden>," let me be clear: no one should have to pay for their coronavirus treatment.
"
2181,2020-04-09,<JoeBiden>, eleven-year-old isaac johnston asked me what else kids should be doing in addition to washing their hands and staying home. my advice was simple:  - stay a safe distance from friends - sneeze into your elbow - and eat your vegetables  
2182,2020-04-09,<JoeBiden>," a total of about 17 million people have filed for unemployment over the last three weeks. this is unprecedented.   the economic devastation that families all across this country are experiencing is not their fault. we've got to take extraordinary steps to protect them.
"
2183,2020-04-08,<JoeBiden>, we're seeing the soul of our nation on full display every day in this crisis — and it makes me so proud to be an american.  
2184,2020-04-08,<JoeBiden>," if we come together, we will defeat donald trump. and when we do that, we will not only do the hard work of rebuilding this nation — we will transform it.
"
2185,2020-04-08,<JoeBiden>," this nation has never been defeated when we’re together. and we’re not going to be defeated now.
"
2186,2020-04-08,<JoeBiden>, join our virtual town hall on unemployment and the issues currently facing working families across the nation. tune in now:  
2187,2020-04-08,<JoeBiden>," the coronavirus is not donald trump's fault, but the slow and chaotic response to it is. he's the commander in chief — it's time he steps up, takes responsibility, and does his job.  "
2188,2020-04-08,<JoeBiden>," the primary is over, but we're just getting started. we're building a campaign to defeat donald trump and ensure that america finally lives up to our founding promises — but we can't do it without your help.  if you're with us, chip in today:  "
2189,2020-04-08,<JoeBiden>," in the wake of covid-19, working families across the country are facing a whole new set of challenges. this afternoon, i'll be hosting a town hall to listen to folks' concerns and discuss what we should be doing to deliver relief.  tune in at 5:30 pm et:  "
2190,2020-04-08,<JoeBiden>, together we will defeat donald trump. but we will also address the climate crisis. we will make college affordable. and we will make health care available to all.  we will not just rebuild this nation – we’ll transform it. and i’m asking you to join me.  
2191,2020-04-08,<JoeBiden>," and to bernie’s supporters: i know that i need to earn your votes. and i know that might take time. but i want you to know that i see you, i hear you, and i understand the urgency of this moment. i hope you'll join us. you're more than welcome: you're needed.
"
2192,2020-04-08,<JoeBiden>," we know how hard this is. you have put the interest of the nation – and the need to defeat donald trump – above all else. and for that we’re grateful. but we want you to know: we’ll be reaching out. you’ll be heard by me. as you say: not me, us.
"
2193,2020-04-08,<JoeBiden>," to bernie and jane, as friends, from jill and me: you haven’t just run a political campaign; you’ve created a movement. and make no mistake about it, we believe it’s a movement that is as powerful today as it was yesterday. that’s a good thing for our nation and our future.
"
2194,2020-04-08,<JoeBiden>," i know bernie well. he’s a good man, a great leader, and one of the most powerful voices for change in our country. and it’s hard to sum up his contributions to our politics in one, single tweet. so i won’t try to.  "
2195,2020-04-08,<JoeBiden>," as jewish families across america and around the world prepare to observe the first night of passover, jill and i want to say chag sameach, and offer our very best wishes, to all who are celebrating.  "
2196,2020-04-08,<JoeBiden>," it is a national disgrace that our health care workers still don't have the protective equipment they need. donald trump needs to fully use the power of the defense production act to deliver these life-saving supplies.
"
2197,2020-04-07,<JoeBiden>, we’re starting to see evidence that long-term exposure to air pollution—which disproportionately affects communities of color &amp; low-income communities—is linked to covid-19 death rates. it's past time we treat pollution like the threat to our health it is.  
2198,2020-04-07,<JoeBiden>," the weeks ahead will be some of the toughest we’ve ever experienced as a nation. we need to face them with the same spirit and resolve that have guided us through previous crises. because out of every trial and tribulation, america has always emerged stronger — and we will again.
"
2199,2020-04-07,<JoeBiden>," folks, i know these are tough times, but this crisis has made it clearer than ever how much elections matter — and what a difference it makes who is in the white house. if you can, please chip in to fuel our campaign. i would really appreciate it.   "
2200,2020-04-07,<JoeBiden>,"  jill and i send our heartfelt condolences to the entire graves family. as the founder of black enterprise, earl graves sr. was a trailblazer in his own right, a leader in the american business community, and paved the way for many black entrepreneurs to realize their dreams.
"
2201,2020-04-07,<JoeBiden>," on #worldhealthday, we thank the tireless health care workers fighting covid-19, and we see clearly why protecting the health of americans requires u.s. global leadership—to coordinate an international response, strengthen health systems everywhere, and prevent the next pandemic.
"
2202,2020-04-07,<JoeBiden>," secretary modly's resignation is appropriate and called for. his disparaging remarks were far beneath the dignity of the office he held. our sailors, our nation, and captain crozier deserve better.
"
2203,2020-04-07,<JoeBiden>, what do fig newtons and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches have in common? listen to this preview of this week's podcast to find out — and then check out the full episode at  
2204,2020-04-07,<JoeBiden>, congressman john lewis is a moral giant who has spent his entire life pushing our nation to live up to our highest ideals. i'm honored to call him a friend — and grateful to have him by my side in this battle for the soul of our nation.  
2205,2020-04-06,<JoeBiden>, we're going to get through this. together.  
2206,2020-04-06,<JoeBiden>," for months, i called on president trump to step up and take the action necessary to combat covid-19.  but week after week, he downplayed the threat it posed, misled the american people, and failed to act.  take a look:  "
2207,2020-04-06,<JoeBiden>," judy, from itsjudyslife, asked an important question during our family town hall on covid-19: what extra precautions should expectant mothers be taking at this time?  listen to what former u.s. surgeon general dr. vivek murthy had to say:  "
2208,2020-04-06,<JoeBiden>," we need a president who actually listens to the experts and heeds their advice.
"
2209,2020-04-06,<JoeBiden>," mr. president, i hope we can gather in milwaukee, but that is going to depend on you stepping up and doing what needs to be done to handle this pandemic. i have laid out how you can do that:  "
2210,2020-04-06,<JoeBiden>," folks, our second episode of here’s the deal is live! this week,  joins me for a discussion on covid-19, president trump’s personal attacks, and the importance of bipartisanship to deliver results.  listen at  "
2211,2020-04-06,<JoeBiden>," it is close to criminal the way they’re dealing with captain crozier. he spoke up to protect his sailors — he should have a commendation, not be fired.  "
2212,2020-04-05,<JoeBiden>," during our family town hall on covid-19, i was asked what we can do to prevent this from happening again. here’s where i'd start:  "
2213,2020-04-05,<JoeBiden>," during these uncertain times, getting the right information out there is so important.  myself and  had the opportunity to host a conversation about covid-19 with 3 family vloggers: itsjudyslife, j house vlogs and the curly coopers. tune in now:  "
2214,2020-04-05,<JoeBiden>," these health care workers — and all those on the front lines of this fight — are american heroes.
"
2215,2020-04-05,<JoeBiden>," every day that donald trump refuses to use the full power of the defense production act further threatens american lives.
"
2216,2020-04-05,<JoeBiden>," we all want to protect our families — the first step is arming ourselves with the facts.    and i hosted a town hall on covid-19 with three family youtubers: itsjudyslife, j house vlogs and the curly coopers. tune in tonight at 7pm edt:  "
2217,2020-04-05,<JoeBiden>," we are at war with this virus — and the health care workers on the front lines are our soldiers. it is unacceptable that they don’t have the lifesaving masks, gowns, and protective gear they need.
"
2218,2020-04-05,<JoeBiden>," out of every crisis, america has always emerged stronger — and we will again. we will not be defeated.  "
2219,2020-04-04,<JoeBiden>, donald trump needs to reopen obamacare enrollment immediately. this is no time to put pettiness and ideology above helping those who are in the greatest need.  lives are at stake.  
2220,2020-04-04,<JoeBiden>," jill and i had the pleasure of hosting a town hall with family vloggers itsjudyslife, the curly coopers, and jhouse vlogs where we answered their questions about the covid-19 outbreak.  tune in to the premiere on sunday at 7pm et:  "
2221,2020-04-04,<JoeBiden>," donald trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he is responsible for failing to prepare our nation to respond to it.
"
2222,2020-04-04,<JoeBiden>," we owe so much to those working around the clock to keep our country running during this crisis. the least we can do is provide the pay, benefits, and protections they need and deserve.
"
2223,2020-04-04,<JoeBiden>," we need a supply commander to step up and take charge and get the doctors, nurses, health care workers, first responders, firefighters, and cops the equipment they need to protect themselves and save lives.  "
2224,2020-04-04,<JoeBiden>," in january, while donald trump was downplaying covid-19, i wrote an op-ed calling for immediate action to combat the growing threat.  in it, i also said trump was the worst possible leader to deal with a public health crisis.  i stand by that statement.  "
2225,2020-04-04,<JoeBiden>," throughout the campaign, i’ve talked a lot about the soul of our nation — we’re seeing that soul on full display. there’s so much good happening — people reaching out to one another, neighbors helping neighbors, caring for those in need. it makes me so proud to be an american.
"
2226,2020-04-03,<JoeBiden>," my friend,  knows what it takes to persevere in the face of uncertainty. take a few minutes to read these powerful words from her on how we can get through this — together.  "
2227,2020-04-03,<JoeBiden>," this is a headline every american should see: “trump administration ended pandemic early-warning program to detect coronaviruses”  donald trump’s shortsighted actions left our nation ill-prepared to deal with this outbreak.
"
2228,2020-04-03,<JoeBiden>," those are the kinds of questions trump will be responsible for. he doesn’t have a great record when it comes to delivering on promises, but i hope this time is different.   being president is about taking responsibility. the blame game won’t cut it. too many lives are at stake.
"
2229,2020-04-03,<JoeBiden>," the cares act provides money to help working people—how do we make sure it gets to them as quickly as possible?   there’s money for major corporations—how do we make sure that there is rigorous oversight to ensure it is used to help workers and not enrich top executives?
"
2230,2020-04-03,<JoeBiden>," i’ve done this work before. it’s hard, painstaking work.   i was in charge of administering the $800 billion recovery act — so i understand that the devil is in the details. it’s about follow-through.
"
2231,2020-04-03,<JoeBiden>," i’ve put together a checklist for making the economic relief and recovery effort work for families, workers, and small businesses. i encourage president trump to adopt any and all of the ideas.  "
2232,2020-04-03,<JoeBiden>," families across the country are impacted by covid-19—and it can be especially difficult to explain to children.   jill and i spoke with itsjudyslife, jhousevlogs and the curly coopers to answer their questions about the crisis. tune in on sunday at 7pm et:  "
2233,2020-04-03,<JoeBiden>," captain crozier was faithful to his duty—both to his sailors and his country. navy leadership sent a chilling message about speaking truth to power. the poor judgment here belongs to the trump admin, not a courageous officer trying to protect his sailors.  "
2234,2020-04-03,<JoeBiden>," this is another clear warning sign that more needs to be done to keep as many people on payroll as possible. fast, bold action to bolster american workers now will save more pain later. congress must get to work immediately on the next package. we can't afford to waste time.
"
2235,2020-04-03,<JoeBiden>," now more than ever, we need to choose hope over fear. we will beat covid-19. we will overcome this. together.
"
2236,2020-04-03,<JoeBiden>, wisconsin — you have until 5 pm ct tonight to request your mail-in absentee ballot ahead of next week’s primary. head to  
2237,2020-04-02,<JoeBiden>, the evidence is clear: donald trump ignored the warnings. he failed to act. and now americans are paying the price.  
2238,2020-04-02,<JoeBiden>, real courage is confronting something that you're afraid to do and doing it anyway. that’s what people across this country are doing every single day in the face of this crisis. they are american heroes.  
2239,2020-04-02,<JoeBiden>," in order for our government to work for all americans, it's important it be representative of all americans. with openly lgbtq individuals only making up .17% of elected officials, we have work to do.  this national #outtowin day, i'm asking: will you run?  "
2240,2020-04-02,<JoeBiden>, i'm about to roll out my plan to make the economic recovery work. tune in now:  
2241,2020-04-02,<JoeBiden>," my heart goes out to the millions of americans who filed unemployment claims in recent weeks, and the millions more who worry what next week holds for them.  donald trump needs to take action to ensure americans receive the economic relief they need as soon as possible.
"
2242,2020-04-02,<JoeBiden>," i know many folks are feeling anxious and worried. i just want you to know that you're not alone. americans in every corner of the country are feeling the same exact way you are. we may be physically apart, but we are all in this together — and we will overcome this. i promise.
"
2243,2020-04-02,<JoeBiden>," our health care workers on the front lines of this fight still don’t have the masks, gowns, and other protective equipment they need. it’s unacceptable.  add your name to demand donald trump use his full authority to deliver these lifesaving supplies:  "
2244,2020-04-02,<JoeBiden>, the economic damage from this public health crisis is both rising and deepening at an alarming rate. it is putting working families and the american middle class through unimaginable financial pain — and they need to be made whole as fast as possible.  
2245,2020-04-01,<JoeBiden>," it's now april, and:  - states still don't have enough tests - hospitals still don't have enough ventilators - health care workers still don't have enough masks  donald trump needs to use all available authorities immediately to solve these shortages.
"
2246,2020-04-01,<JoeBiden>," at a time when americans might need health care the most, the trump administration is preventing people who need insurance from getting it. their cruelty truly knows no bounds.  "
2247,2020-04-01,<JoeBiden>," amigos, ¡es el día del censo! solo toma unos minutos completar el censo, pero ayudará a determinar el futuro de su comunidad para la próxima década. visite  "
2248,2020-04-01,<JoeBiden>," this callous decision will cost lives. period.
"
2249,2020-04-01,<JoeBiden>," folks, it’s census day! the census only takes a few minutes to complete but will help determine the future of your community for the next decade. head to  "
2250,2020-04-01,<JoeBiden>," it is a national disgrace that our health care workers still don't have the protective equipment they need.
"
2251,2020-04-01,<JoeBiden>," thank you to the governors who are meeting this moment with decisive action, a steady hand, and compassionate leadership. thank you for stepping up when president trump has not.
"
2252,2020-04-01,<JoeBiden>, the words of a president matter.  
2253,2020-03-31,<JoeBiden>," we’re in the middle of a global pandemic, and the trump administration is preventing people from getting health care.  i can’t believe this needs to be said, but president trump needs to reopen obamacare enrollment, and he needs to do it now. lives are at stake.
"
2254,2020-03-31,<JoeBiden>," hoy, al honrar la vida y el legado del activista césar chávez, también agradecemos a los más de 2 millones de trabajadores agrícolas que están en primera línea, trabajando para mantener a los estadounidenses alimentados y sanos durante esta pandemia.  "
2255,2020-03-31,<JoeBiden>," today as we honor the life and legacy of civil rights and labor movement activist, césar chávez, we also thank the more than 2 million farmworkers who are on the frontlines, working to keep americans fed and healthy during this pandemic.  "
2256,2020-03-31,<JoeBiden>," tonight marks our biggest public end-of-quarter deadline of the campaign so far. i know times are tough, but what’s at stake in this election has never been clearer. if you could chip in to help us reach our goal, i would really appreciate it:  "
2257,2020-03-31,<JoeBiden>, it's 2020 — it’s unacceptable that women still don’t get equal pay for equal work. let’s close the gender pay gap and end #equalpayday once and for all.  
2258,2020-03-31,<JoeBiden>," in the midst of a pandemic, the trump administration chose to expend effort to attempt to disestablish the mashpee wampanoag tribe’s reservation. #istandwithmashpee and with all of indian country.  "
2259,2020-03-31,<JoeBiden>," today and every day,  and i are proud to stand with the trans community. we see you, we support you, and we will continue to do everything we can to ensure you are affirmed and accepted just as you are. #transdayofvisibility
"
2260,2020-03-31,<JoeBiden>," as president, i would never send an american soldier anywhere in the world without the equipment and protection they need. we should not do any less for the heroes on the front lines of the battle we’re in now.  "
2261,2020-03-31,<JoeBiden>," i'm confident that the american people will meet this moment. there’s never been a challenge we've been unable to overcome if we do it together.
"
2262,2020-03-31,<JoeBiden>," we have to place a temporary ban on evictions nationwide. no one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a pandemic.
"
2263,2020-03-31,<JoeBiden>," in order to combat covid-19, we need both a decisive public health response and a decisive economic response. i’ve laid out exactly what i would do if i were president during this crisis, take a look:  "
2264,2020-03-30,<JoeBiden>," our health care workers are putting their lives on the line every day, and our president is accusing them of stealing lifesaving supplies. it's time for donald trump to do his job, so our heroes are able to do theirs. lives are at stake.  "
2265,2020-03-30,<JoeBiden>, this is unconscionable. americans are already afraid of the impact the deadly covid-19 pandemic is having on their lives — they don't need the added stress of losing their health insurance. drop the lawsuit.  
2266,2020-03-30,<JoeBiden>," i know these are confusing and scary times, so for the first episode of our new podcast i sat down with ron klain, former white house ebola response coordinator, to help provide some clarity around covid-19.  listen at  "
2267,2020-03-30,<JoeBiden>," the medical professionals on the front lines of this crisis are american heroes — risking their lives in order to save others. we owe them more than we could ever repay, but we can start by ensuring they have the protective equipment they need to stay safe. #nationaldoctorsday
"
2268,2020-03-30,<JoeBiden>," president trump should be using the defense production act to get our first responders and health care providers the masks, gowns, and protective equipment they need. this is a matter of life and death.  "
2269,2020-03-30,<JoeBiden>," the american people are generous, decent, good, and fair. in times of crisis, we come together as one. we look out for our neighbors and lend a hand to those in need. we will get through this, together. i promise.
"
2270,2020-03-30,<JoeBiden>," not a joke, folks, we just launched our new podcast. it’s called ""here's the deal."" for our first episode, i sat down with ron klain, former white house ebola response coordinator, for a discussion on covid-19.  listen at  "
2271,2020-03-29,<JoeBiden>," i am issuing this challenge to the president: in the next 48 hours, direct the production and distribution of respirator masks, gloves, protective face shields and gowns to fill every supply request made by a governor to the federal government.   lives are at stake.
"
2272,2020-03-29,<JoeBiden>," we will overcome this — together.
"
2273,2020-03-29,<JoeBiden>," as president, i will always choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction.
"
2274,2020-03-29,<JoeBiden>," it's hard to read this story and not conclude one thing: the trump administration failed the american people.
"
2275,2020-03-29,<JoeBiden>," instacart needs to step up and give their workers the protections and pay they need and deserve. now.
"
2276,2020-03-29,<JoeBiden>," dreamers are americans. we should never endanger or throw into question their ability to contribute to our nation, but to do so in a moment of national crisis is beyond misguided.  "
2277,2020-03-29,<JoeBiden>," the folks working to keep our country running are true heroes — and we need to ensure they have the protections, accommodations, and benefits they need and deserve. we couldn't get through this without them.  "
2278,2020-03-28,<JoeBiden>, donald trump’s ego will cost lives.  
2279,2020-03-28,<JoeBiden>," losing a loved one is incredibly difficult, but it’s even harder when you’re not able to be with them in their final moments — and that’s what’s happening around the country because of the coronavirus. it’s heartbreaking, and i’m keeping everyone affected in my prayers.  "
2280,2020-03-28,<JoeBiden>," the administration promised millions of tests by mid-march. but it's not happening fast enough. where are the tests, mr. president?
"
2281,2020-03-28,<JoeBiden>," mr. president, this isn’t about you, it’s about the health of the american people. stop making everything personal.  you are the president of all 50 states — not just the ones that voted for you or that have governors who “treat you right.” it’s time you acted like it.
"
2282,2020-03-28,<JoeBiden>," let me be clear: no one should have to pay for coronavirus testing or treatment.
"
2283,2020-03-28,<JoeBiden>," last night, the great rev. joseph e. lowery passed away, leaving an indelible mark on our country's history towards progress. he never once wavered in his spirit and in the resolve to end injustice — wherever he saw it. our thoughts and prayers are with his family.
"
2284,2020-03-27,<JoeBiden>," i just wrapped up tonight’s cnn town hall, where we discussed covid-19 and how we move forward. i know times are tough, but the stakes in this election have never been higher. if you could chip in a few dollars i would really appreciate it.  "
2285,2020-03-27,<JoeBiden>," you can't deal with the economic crisis until you deal with the public health crisis. it's a false choice.
"
2286,2020-03-27,<JoeBiden>," in response to the economic impact of covid-19, we need to provide immediate relief to those who are drowning in student debt.  "
2287,2020-03-27,<JoeBiden>, join me and the hardworking folks on the frontlines of the covid-19 outbreak for a virtual round table. tune in now:  
2288,2020-03-27,<JoeBiden>," this afternoon, i’ll be sitting down for a conversation with nurses, firefighters, and emergency medical technicians on the front lines of the fight against covid-19. tune in at 4:15 et to join us:  "
2289,2020-03-27,<JoeBiden>," patients need ventilators.  nurses need equipment.  and donald trump is attacking people who dare to do something about it.   i thank god every day for people like  who are doing the work he won’t.
"
2290,2020-03-27,<JoeBiden>," the coronavirus is not donald trump's fault, but his inept response is.  he ignored the warnings for months, downplayed the threat it posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak.  it's one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history.
"
2291,2020-03-27,<JoeBiden>," it’s never a matter of if another pandemic will happen, it’s just a matter of when — and it’s the president’s job to ensure we’re ready.  donald trump's careless, shortsighted actions left our nation ill-prepared and now americans are paying the price.
"
2292,2020-03-26,<JoeBiden>," the relief bill passed by congress was a good start, but now we need to:  - forgive at least $10,000 of student loan debt per person - provide emergency paid sick leave to everyone who needs it - ensure no one has to pay for covid-19 treatment or an eventual vaccine
"
2293,2020-03-26,<JoeBiden>," the american people are incredible. across the country, folks are pulling together, helping one another, and doing what needs to be done to stop the spread. i'm so darn proud to be an american.  "
2294,2020-03-26,<JoeBiden>," president trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he bears full responsibility for the slow and uncoordinated response. the harsh reality is that at least 3 million people now don’t have jobs because he didn’t do his job when it mattered.  "
2295,2020-03-26,<JoeBiden>," thank you to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, and everyone on the front lines of this fight. your hard work is what makes america run every single day — but especially in times of crisis. we truly couldn't get through this without you.  "
2296,2020-03-26,<JoeBiden>," the trump administration misled the american people.
"
2297,2020-03-26,<JoeBiden>," we've gotta act now to keep the doors open for small businesses on main street.  it's simple: the government provides the guarantees; the banks have to move the loans out fast.  if they won't, we need a financial version of the defense production act to make it happen.
"
2298,2020-03-26,<JoeBiden>," if i were president, here's what i would do right now:  - use all available authorities to turn the tide on this epidemic - launch a task force to ensure money rapidly gets to people who need it - bring leaders of congress together to build the next deal  "
2299,2020-03-26,<JoeBiden>," live from our homes to yours. looking forward to tonight, "
2300,2020-03-26,<JoeBiden>," it's hard to believe this has to be said, but if i'm elected president, i will always lead the way with science. i will listen to the experts and heed their advice. i will do the opposite of what we’re seeing donald trump do every day.
"
2301,2020-03-26,<JoeBiden>," across the country, ordinary people are stepping up and doing extraordinary things — folks like isaac and stephanie, who are creating supplies for their local hospitals. stories like this one make me so proud to be an american. we will overcome this challenge — together.
"
2302,2020-03-26,<JoeBiden>," the senate passed a major economic relief package late last night. it's a very important step, but the key is how it will be executed. if i were president, here's how i'd make it work:  "
2303,2020-03-25,<JoeBiden>," ""if the administration had reacted to the ventilator shortage in february, a private sector effort starting now might have made lifesaving equipment in mid- to late april. now it is unlikely to be before june.""  donald trump's inaction will cost lives.  "
2304,2020-03-25,<JoeBiden>," in times of crisis, american presidents have always stepped up to meet the moment. but all we've gotten from donald trump are lies, excuses, and scapegoats.  trump has failed our country at a time when we need him most.  "
2305,2020-03-25,<JoeBiden>, alright  join us for happy hour. watch our virtual round table on the issues that matter to young folks:  
2306,2020-03-25,<JoeBiden>, we will not allow this pandemic to rob our young people of the futures and the economic opportunities they have been working to build.  
2307,2020-03-25,<JoeBiden>, dr. fauci should be on tv a lot more than president trump.  
2308,2020-03-25,<JoeBiden>," alright, folks. we're doing a happy hour tonight and you're invited. join us at 6:30 pm et at  "
2309,2020-03-25,<JoeBiden>, i'm about to deliver remarks on the impact of the coronavirus on young americans. tune in to watch live:  
2310,2020-03-25,<JoeBiden>," the character of the american people is on full display across the country. in the middle of a crisis, folks are stepping up and doing what they can to help out those in need. the angeleno campaign, led by my friend mayor  is a great example of the work being done.
"
2311,2020-03-25,<JoeBiden>," the american people are rising to meet this moment. we need our president to do the same.
"
2312,2020-03-24,<JoeBiden>," let me be very clear: no one is expendable. no matter your age, race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability.  no life is worth losing to add one more point to the dow.
"
2313,2020-03-24,<JoeBiden>," president trump says no one saw this coming, but that’s just not true. our own intelligence officials were warning of the coronavirus threat back in january. trump ignored them, and now we’re paying the price.  "
2314,2020-03-24,<JoeBiden>," as americans, we may be physically apart, but we are truly all in this together. when we have stood as one, this nation has never been defeated. and we are not going to be defeated now.  "
2315,2020-03-24,<JoeBiden>," president trump should stop attacking our nation's governors on twitter and start delivering them the life-saving supplies they need.
"
2316,2020-03-24,<JoeBiden>, let me be clear: donald trump knew about the threat the coronavirus posed and failed to act. it’s one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in american history.  
2317,2020-03-24,<JoeBiden>," the stakes in this election couldn’t be higher. donald trump is wholly unfit to lead this nation — and that has become even clearer in the last few weeks. we have to vote him out of the white house.
"
2318,2020-03-24,<JoeBiden>," it has been a month since this tweet.
"
2319,2020-03-24,<JoeBiden>," i know we are up to this challenge. the american people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. we can and will overcome this — together.
"
2320,2020-03-23,<JoeBiden>," as this public health crisis rages, with the economy in peril, and with front line workers putting their lives at risk — trump and republican attorneys-general are attempting to strip health insurance away from millions.  no more games. drop this lawsuit. save lives.  "
2321,2020-03-23,<JoeBiden>," in january, donald trump claimed the coronavirus was “totally under control.”  in february, he said it would disappear.  now, he’s saying it “could’ve been stopped pretty easily if we had known.”  donald trump knew. he failed to act. and now we’re paying the price.
"
2322,2020-03-23,<JoeBiden>," across the country, there are incredible stories of folks stepping up to help their neighbors, stories like this one. it's who we are as americans. brave and big-hearted. always willing to lend a hand and care for those in need.  we will overcome this, together.
"
2323,2020-03-23,<JoeBiden>," where are the tests? where are the masks? where are the ventilators?  the american people deserve answers, mr. president.  "
2324,2020-03-23,<JoeBiden>," obamacare was a big deal — and that still holds true a decade later. on its tenth anniversary, we need to double down on our efforts to protect it from donald trump's attacks and build on it to ensure every american receives the care they need.  "
2325,2020-03-23,<JoeBiden>," a $500 billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions is unacceptable. we have to ensure the help these companies receive goes to their workers — not their ceos.  it's time for president trump and mitch mcconnell to put american families first.
"
2326,2020-03-23,<JoeBiden>," during a public health crisis, it's unconscionable that donald trump and others are continuing a lawsuit designed to strip millions of people of their health insurance. this morning, i called on them to drop the lawsuit and protect americans' health care.  "
2327,2020-03-23,<JoeBiden>," what is president trump waiting for?   health care workers don't have enough masks to keep themselves safe.  hospitals are running low on ventilators that sick americans could literally need to breathe.  he needs to act now to deliver these essential supplies. lives depend on it.
"
2328,2020-03-23,<JoeBiden>, i'm about to deliver remarks on the coronavirus pandemic. tune in to watch live:  
2329,2020-03-23,<JoeBiden>," president trump and mitch mcconnell are trying to put a corporate bailout ahead of families. it's simply wrong. we need to be focused on helping hardworking americans, communities, and small businesses — not handing big corporations a blank check.  "
2330,2020-03-22,<JoeBiden>," it’s simple: president trump and mitch mcconnell are trying to put corporate bailouts ahead of families. and it’s wrong. hardworking, struggling americans should come first — not the big corporations looking for a blank check.  "
2331,2020-03-22,<JoeBiden>, president trump’s dithering on preparing us for this global pandemic and his lies about his response to this dangerous crisis is one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in american history.   
2332,2020-03-22,<JoeBiden>," in this moment of crisis, we should be sending federal resources to those who need it most. it's not just good economics — it's the right thing to do. we have to get this right.
"
2333,2020-03-22,<JoeBiden>," we should also increase monthly social security checks by $200/month, as proposed by senator wyden and colleagues. seniors and people with disabilities are uniquely at risk right now.
"
2334,2020-03-22,<JoeBiden>," additionally, we should forgive a minimum of $10,000/person of federal student loans, as proposed by senator warren and colleagues. young people and other student debt holders bore the brunt of the last crisis. it shouldn't happen again.
"
2335,2020-03-22,<JoeBiden>," on march 6th, donald trump claimed: “anybody that wants a test can get a test.”  that was a flat-out lie then, and it’s still not true today. it’s a disgrace.  we need to ensure everyone who needs a test can get one free of charge. period.
"
2336,2020-03-22,<JoeBiden>," no bill should pass without immediate, generous relief for workers who are losing jobs and hours, small businesses losing revenue, and communities facing emergency needs.
"
2337,2020-03-22,<JoeBiden>," no bill should pass without conditions on corporations to ensure the help they get goes to their workers, not their ceos. no blank checks.
"
2338,2020-03-22,<JoeBiden>," it's simple: the white house and  have tried to put corporate bailouts ahead of families.
"
2339,2020-03-22,<JoeBiden>," we owe a debt of gratitude to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, transportation workers, public safety officials, and everyone working around the clock to keep our country running. thank you, thank you, thank you for all you’re doing.
"
2340,2020-03-22,<JoeBiden>," mr. president — stop lying and start acting. use the full extent of your authorities, now, to ensure that we are producing all essential goods and delivering them where they need to go.
"
2341,2020-03-22,<JoeBiden>," in times of crisis, a president should calm and heal, lead the way with a steady hand, and provide a beacon of hope for the american people.  donald trump is incapable of doing that.  "
2342,2020-03-21,<JoeBiden>," we need action, not more empty words from president trump. it’s time for him to step up and do his job.  "
2343,2020-03-21,<JoeBiden>, donald trump has failed the american people.  
2344,2020-03-21,<JoeBiden>," everyone knows that we're facing a real crisis from the coronavirus. but do you know how we got here and what we need to do next? ron klain, former white house ebola response coordinator, breaks it down for us:  "
2345,2020-03-21,<JoeBiden>," the coronavirus test should be made widely available and free.  the coronavirus vaccine, when ready, should be made widely available and free.  treatment for coronavirus should be free, too.  we're in a crisis. no one should have to pay for their coronavirus health care costs.
"
2346,2020-03-21,<JoeBiden>," from day one, the goal of our campaign has been to unite the country — and in times of crisis, that goal is more important than ever. if we come together and all do our part, we will overcome this. i promise.
"
2347,2020-03-20,<JoeBiden>," the president has been behind the curve throughout this whole response. he’s talking about yesterday rather than where we need to be tomorrow. the president needs to stop talking and start rallying government action with the urgency and ambition this moment demands.
"
2348,2020-03-20,<JoeBiden>," now he’s switched to falsely telling us that he’s taking action that he has not taken, and promising results that he’s not delivering. people are scared. they're frightened. and their president is just exacerbating their concerns.
"
2349,2020-03-20,<JoeBiden>," in times of crisis, the american people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. donald trump has not been that president. for months, he falsely told us we had nothing to worry about while praising china’s response for managing the coronavirus.
"
2350,2020-03-20,<JoeBiden>," if you have a minute, read these stories of folks coming together and helping out their neighbors. they represent who we are as americans. in times of crisis, we stand as one. we look out for each other. and that’s how we’ll get through this — together.  "
2351,2020-03-20,<JoeBiden>," the president says no one cares about being tested.  have you or a loved one had trouble getting tested?
"
2352,2020-03-20,<JoeBiden>," getting money quickly to families is the right goal, but senate republicans are proposing to send significantly lower amounts to low-income families than those with higher incomes. that’s terrible economics &amp; terrible values. we should be targeting help to those who need it most.
"
2353,2020-03-20,<JoeBiden>, the lack of coronavirus testing in the u.s. is a national disgrace.  
2354,2020-03-20,<JoeBiden>," the least we can do for every grocery and retail worker working around the clock during this crisis is to provide a $15 minimum wage, paid sick leave, and strong workplace protections.
"
2355,2020-03-20,<JoeBiden>," every ceo in america should be focusing on workers, families, and communities — not executive compensation and share prices.
"
2356,2020-03-20,<JoeBiden>," i am calling on every ceo in america to publicly commit now to not buying back their company's stock over the course of the next year. as workers face the physical and economic consequences of the coronavirus, our corporate leaders cannot cede responsibility for their employees.
"
2357,2020-03-19,<JoeBiden>," . has never been afraid to speak without fear, to be brave in the face of injustice, and to empower others to get off the sidelines. i'm thrilled and honored to have her support.
"
2358,2020-03-19,<JoeBiden>," the words of a president matter, and donald trump has used his to downplay covid-19 and mislead the american people. he is unfit to lead us through this crisis.
"
2359,2020-03-19,<JoeBiden>," this administration is truly morally bankrupt.
"
2360,2020-03-19,<JoeBiden>," every worker on the front lines of the fight against covid-19 deserves protections and accommodations that keep them and their families safe. i'm glad to see states stepping up to support folks — employers must do the same.
"
2361,2020-03-19,<JoeBiden>, my prayers go out to all those on the front lines of this crisis.  
2362,2020-03-19,<JoeBiden>," doctors and nurses are making their own makeshift face masks today as they risk their lives to care for others. what other finding do you need to see to convince you to use every power you have to expand our supply of essential equipment, mr. president?
"
2363,2020-03-19,<JoeBiden>," yesterday, president trump said he was invoking the defense production act, then turned around and said he wasn't planning to use it. the president should exercise these powers now. we need more ventilators, protective equipment, and critical supplies. we need action, not words.
"
2364,2020-03-19,<JoeBiden>," . has put her life on the line in service of this country and continues to serve with honor today. i’m grateful to have her support and look forward to working with her to restore honor and decency to the white house.
"
2365,2020-03-19,<JoeBiden>," this is a moment to look out for our neighbors, care for the elderly, and thank the workers on the front lines of this fight. this is a moment to believe in one another.  when we do that, when we see the best in each of us, we’ll lift this nation up and get through this together.
"
2366,2020-03-19,<JoeBiden>," the obama-biden administration set up the white house national security council directorate for global health security and biodefense to prepare for future pandemics like covid-19.  donald trump eliminated it — and now we're paying the price.
"
2367,2020-03-18,<JoeBiden>, our campaign is building the broad coalition we need to win in november.  
2368,2020-03-18,<JoeBiden>," i give you my word as a biden: when i'm president, i will lead with science, listen to the experts and heed their advice, and always tell you the truth.
"
2369,2020-03-18,<JoeBiden>," it is a national disgrace that millions of americans do not have a single day of paid sick leave.
"
2370,2020-03-18,<JoeBiden>," we need comprehensive action to combat the coronavirus outbreak. that's why i'm calling for a decisive public health response to curb its spread and provide treatment to those in need, and a decisive economic response that delivers real relief.  "
2371,2020-03-18,<JoeBiden>," i know the american people have the capacity to meet this moment. there’s nothing we’ve been unable to accomplish if we do it together.
"
2372,2020-03-18,<JoeBiden>," stop the xenophobic fear-mongering. be honest. take responsibility. do your job.
"
2373,2020-03-18,<JoeBiden>," much has been made of changes in president trump's tone in recent days. but with our health care system at risk, a virus spreading, our economy on the brink — and so many lives at stake — it’s time to be less interested in his words and more focused on his actions — or inaction.
"
2374,2020-03-18,<JoeBiden>," in times of crisis, americans stand as one. volunteers raise their hands to help. neighbors look out for neighbors. businesses take care of their workers. that's who we are.  we can and will meet this challenge — together.  "
2375,2020-03-18,<JoeBiden>," the next president will have to salvage our reputation, rebuild confidence in our leadership, and mobilize our country and our allies to rapidly meet new challenges — like future pandemics.  we need a leader who will be ready on day one.  "
2376,2020-03-17,<JoeBiden>," thank you to everyone in arizona, florida, and illinois who supported our campaign. from day one, our goal has been to unify our party and our nation — and tonight, we are one step closer to achieving that goal. let’s do this, together.  "
2377,2020-03-17,<JoeBiden>, i'm about to address tonight's election results from delaware. tune in to watch live:  
2378,2020-03-17,<JoeBiden>," this moment demands that we choose:  hope over fear unity over division truth over lies science over fiction
"
2379,2020-03-17,<JoeBiden>," this crisis requires a decisive economic response. we need to do whatever it takes to deliver relief for our families and ensure the stability of our economy.
"
2380,2020-03-17,<JoeBiden>," elections are happening today in arizona, florida, and illinois. i encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can. if you vote in person, please wash your hands, don’t touch your face, and stay 6’ from others in line. learn more:  "
2381,2020-03-17,<JoeBiden>," my mom always said, ""being irish is about faith, family, and courage.""  today, we celebrate the strong role irish-americans have played in our communities, the strength of the u.s.-ireland relationship, and the ongoing values shared by our two nations. happy st. patrick's day!  "
2382,2020-03-17,<JoeBiden>," michigan’s response has far outpaced the federal government’s in this crisis. gov. whitmer is leading decisively, while you are live-tweeting her appearances on cable news.  we need a president who will do their job and lead this country.
"
2383,2020-03-16,<JoeBiden>," coronavirus is bigger than any one of us. please take care of yourself, wash your hands, and practice social distancing. we will get through this — together.  "
2384,2020-03-16,<JoeBiden>," if i win the nomination, my pick for vice president will be a woman. if i win the presidency and have the opportunity, i will name the first black woman ever to the supreme court.  a biden administration will reflect the country we are proud to work for.  "
2385,2020-03-16,<JoeBiden>," we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. donald trump threatens everything we stand for, he has:  - fanned the flames of hate - embraced white supremacists - separated families at the border - threatened our democracy  we have to get him out of the white house.
"
2386,2020-03-16,<JoeBiden>, the coronavirus pandemic is bigger than any one individual. this moment requires all of us to come together — across the country and around the world — to solve this crisis.  
2387,2020-03-16,<JoeBiden>," in the wake of the coronavirus, we need a major bailout package that delivers real relief to the american people — not more handouts for giant corporations.  "
2388,2020-03-16,<JoeBiden>," thank you to our health care providers, first responders, grocery and other retail workers, and so many others that are keeping us safe and prepared. this coronavirus pandemic makes it clear that all workers deserve paid sick live, workplace protections and unemployment benefits.
"
2389,2020-03-16,<JoeBiden>," we need a president who will always choose science over fiction.
"
2390,2020-03-15,<JoeBiden>," i know times are tough — but we’re going to get through this.   we’ve got four big primaries coming up on tuesday, and our campaign could really use your help. chip in what you can — i really appreciate it:  "
2391,2020-03-15,<JoeBiden>," $90 billion in clean energy funding. a huge reduction in the cost of solar so that we'll never build another coal plant again.     i did that. bernie watched. #demdebate
"
2392,2020-03-15,<JoeBiden>," we're building the campaign that will win this nomination and defeat donald trump. if you're with us, please chip in what you can right now to keep the momentum going from tonight's #demdebate:  "
2393,2020-03-15,<JoeBiden>," the coronavirus pandemic is like a war. and in a war, you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people. #demdebate  "
2394,2020-03-15,<JoeBiden>," we need a comprehensive response to the coronavirus outbreak. my plan mounts a decisive public health response to curb the spread of this disease and provide treatment to those in need, and a decisive economic response that delivers real relief.   "
2395,2020-03-15,<JoeBiden>," xenophobia is a disease. #demdebate
"
2396,2020-03-15,<JoeBiden>," we have to treat climate change like the existential threat it is. as president, i will:  - end subsidies for fossil fuel corporations - ban new drilling on federal lands &amp; waters - hold oil executives accountable - rally the world to raise the commitments of the paris agreement
"
2397,2020-03-15,<JoeBiden>," no se puede negar la amenaza existencial del cambio climático, y se está acabando el tiempo para abordarlo. tenemos que tomar medidas sin precedentes aquí en nuestro país y unir al mundo para hacer frente a esta crisis.   lea el plan completo:  "
2398,2020-03-15,<JoeBiden>, there is no denying the existential threat of climate change — and time is running out to address it. we have to take unprecedented action here at home and rally the world to tackle this crisis head on.   read the full plan:  
2399,2020-03-15,<JoeBiden>, bernie sanders voted against comprehensive immigration reform — and then went on tv with lou dobbs to brag about it.  immigrants don't take our jobs. they create jobs. and we need a president who believes that to his or her core. #demdebate  
2400,2020-03-15,<JoeBiden>," my running mate will be a woman. #demdebate
"
2401,2020-03-15,<JoeBiden>," if senator  is the nominee, i will throw my full weight behind his campaign and do everything i can to get him elected. if i am the nominee, i hope he will do the same. nothing can keep us from being united in the fight to defeat trump. #demdebate
"
2402,2020-03-15,<JoeBiden>," bernie sanders voted against the brady background check bill that has kept 3 million firearms out of dangerous hands, not once, not twice, but five times.   we need a president who will stand up to the  — not one who stood with them against lifesaving gun safety measures.
"
2403,2020-03-15,<JoeBiden>, i took on paul ryan's cuts to medicare and social security — to his face. #demdebate  
2404,2020-03-15,<JoeBiden>," people need help now. not four years from now. not eight years from now. we need a health care plan that can pass. #demdebate

"
2608,2020-02-25,<JoeBiden>, tom steyer invested $90 million in the nation's largest private prison company — a company that allegedly hog-tied and beat kids in south carolina. it's despicable.  president obama and i worked to phase out private prisons — i will fight to get rid of them as president.

2611,2020-02-25,<JoeBiden>," ban assault weapons.  enact universal background checks.  hold gun manufacturers accountable.  end our gun violence epidemic.
"
2612,2020-02-25,<JoeBiden>," in 2005, i voted to allow americans to hold gun manufacturers accountable for the death and terror they've caused in our country.   bernie sanders voted to let them off the hook.  "
2613,2020-02-25,<JoeBiden>," this moment requires strong american leadership and disciplined diplomacy to lead a global response grounded in science — donald trump is incapable of that. he is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.
"
2614,2020-02-25,<JoeBiden>," with donald trump out of the way, there’s no limit to what america can achieve.
"
2615,2020-02-25,<JoeBiden>," the right to vote is the most fundamental american right there is. we should be making voting easier — not harder.
"
2616,2020-02-24,<JoeBiden>," this election is about more than just beating donald trump. it’s about:  - replacing betsy devos with an actual educator - having an attorney general who defends the constitution, not the president - ensuring our epa administrator believes climate change is an existential threat

"
2620,2020-02-24,<JoeBiden>," vanessa, i'm keeping you in my prayers today. grief is a heavy burden to bear — especially with the eyes of the world watching. but there will come a day, i promise you, when the memory of kobe and gianna will bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye.
"
2621,2020-02-24,<JoeBiden>, i think barack obama was one hell of a president. i was proud to stand alongside him every step of the way — and fought like hell to make sure he was re-elected.  bernie sanders can't say the same.  
2622,2020-02-24,<JoeBiden>," i promise you that if i am elected president, we will hold gun manufacturers accountable for the carnage they have caused.  "
2623,2020-02-24,<JoeBiden>," housing should be a right — not a privilege. but far too many americans lack access to affordable, quality, and safe housing.   today, i'm releasing my $640 billion plan to change that:  "

2900,2020-01-21,<JoeBiden>, i've been fighting to protect — and expand — social security for my whole career. any suggestion otherwise is just flat-out wrong.  
2901,2020-01-21,<JoeBiden>," our government should work for everyone — not just the powerful or super-wealthy. we need to:  - eliminate all private dollars from federal elections - end citizens united and dark money groups - increase transparency and accountability
"
2902,2020-01-21,<JoeBiden>," make no mistake, obamacare is on the ballot this november. coverage for millions of americans and protections for pre-existing conditions are on the ballot.  we have to protect the progress we've made and show up to the polls to defend the affordable care act.
"
2903,2020-01-21,<JoeBiden>," ten years ago, the supreme court unleashed an unlimited flood of dark money into our politics with its citizens united decision—further corrupting our politics &amp; eroding faith in our democracy.  it’s time we end citizens united. add your name if you agree:  "
2904,2020-01-21,<JoeBiden>, i was reminded this weekend by pastor mccallum that we've got to bring a sense of community back to this country. that work starts now.  
2905,2020-01-20,<JoeBiden>," social security is the bedrock of american retirement. and in my administration, we won't just protect it. we'll expand it.  "
2906,2020-01-20,<JoeBiden>," thanks for acknowledging this, bernie. these kinds of attacks have no place in this primary. let’s all keep our focus on making donald trump a one-term president.
"
2907,2020-01-20,<JoeBiden>," the courage shown today by the lawmakers, staff, and gun safety advocates in richmond is inspiring. it's long past time the calls for reform are met with concrete action that ends our gun violence epidemic. #istandwithvirginia today, and every day, until the job is done.
"
2908,2020-01-20,<JoeBiden>, from my days as a public defender to my time as vice president — i've spent my entire career fighting against discrimination and championing civil rights. i'm running for president to bring that fight to the oval office and give everyone a full share of the american dream.  
2909,2020-01-20,<JoeBiden>," in times of crisis and division, a president should seek to calm and heal. but time and again, president trump has chosen to further stoke the flames.  he is poison to the soul of our nation.
"
2910,2020-01-20,<JoeBiden>," as dr. martin luther king jr. said, “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” as we seek to restore the soul of this nation from a long moral lapse, we look to those words and take solace that this too shall pass and justice will prevail. #mlkday
"
2911,2020-01-20,<JoeBiden>, honored to have won jacquelyn's endorsement.  
2912,2020-01-20,<JoeBiden>," donald trump's poisonous rhetoric and divisive politics have brought america to an inflection point. in this moment, we have an enormous opportunity to take the next great step forward as a nation.  let's get to work. we can do this, together.  "
2913,2020-01-19,<JoeBiden>," this is a big victory for south carolina. the right to vote is the most fundamental american right there is — we have to break down barriers to the ballot box and ensure every american can make their voice heard.
"
2914,2020-01-19,<JoeBiden>," the big banks didn't need an additional $32 billion in savings, and their shareholders certainly didn't need an extra $21.5 billion in payouts.  it's time we ensure corporations pay their fair share and that our country rewards work — not wealth.
"
2915,2020-01-19,<JoeBiden>," the 60th anniversary of our alliance with japan reminds us that close partnership and deep cooperation are among our greatest assets. i understand the value of our alliances; they make us stronger. i would build on this legacy, rather than dismantling it.
"
2916,2020-01-19,<JoeBiden>," i stand with the snow plow drivers who work day in and day out to keep our roads safe, often in dangerous conditions. every worker in this country deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages and benefits. stay safe out there,   "
2917,2020-01-19,<JoeBiden>," thank you  for sharing your story. there’s a lot of kids who i bet needed to hear it.   being different isn’t a barrier to success. it can give you the strength to save lives in a crash landing — or even run for president.
"
2918,2020-01-18,<JoeBiden>," donald trump continues to embrace corruption at home and abroad. rather than addressing the root causes pushing people to flee central america, he has undermined anti-corruption bodies—first in guatemala and now in honduras.  "
2919,2020-01-18,<JoeBiden>," there used to be a basic bargain in this country—when you worked hard, you shared in the prosperity you helped create. but ceos and wall street continue to put profits over workers. it's wrong.  we have to restore the dignity of work and ensure everyone earns what they deserve.
"
2920,2020-01-18,<JoeBiden>," together, we're going to beat donald trump and take back this country.  chip in if you’re ready to leave him in the dust:  "
2921,2020-01-18,<JoeBiden>," weapons of war have no place in our communities. it’s time we take on the  and ban assault weapons for good.
"
2922,2020-01-18,<JoeBiden>," vermont — you don't have to wait until march 3rd to cast your ballot, you can early vote now! head to  "
2923,2020-01-17,<JoeBiden>," happy birthday,  you’re a shining light in the lives of all that have the honor of knowing you. jill and i are grateful to call you a dear friend.  but don’t tell jill — i’m still eating ice cream. and i’m not sorry.  "
2924,2020-01-17,<JoeBiden>, we need a president who respects our troops — and who will restore honor and integrity to the oval office.  
2925,2020-01-17,<JoeBiden>," donald trump says he prefers war heroes who ""weren't captured."" he attacks gold star families. now he calls our generals “losers,"" “babies” and “dopes.""  he degrades the office he holds every day.  "
2926,2020-01-17,<JoeBiden>," minnesota — early voting is now open! don’t wait until march 3rd to cast your ballot, head to the polls and be one of the first in the nation to make your voice heard in the primary.  find everything you need to know here:  "
2927,2020-01-17,<JoeBiden>," it is a moral failing when children are ripped from their parents' arms, locked away in overcrowded detention centers, and denied toothbrushes and soap.  we have to end donald trump's cruel policies and build a fair and humane immigration system.
"
2928,2020-01-17,<JoeBiden>," this isn't just about who i am, this is about who we are as a country. we're tough, resilient, but always full of hope. with every fiber in my being, i believe there’s not a single thing we can't do—if we do it together.  "
2929,2020-01-16,<JoeBiden>, hate never goes away; it just hides. and when leaders give it oxygen — as donald trump has done — it comes roaring back.  
2930,2020-01-16,<JoeBiden>," america’s farmers have had enough of your empty promises, mr. president.  "
2931,2020-01-16,<JoeBiden>," let's be clear: white supremacy, racism, and violence have no place in america. we have to root out these evils and give hate no safe harbor. if we stand together, we will win the battle for the soul of our nation.
"
2932,2020-01-16,<JoeBiden>, a president has to be able to not only fight — but heal and bring our country together. i promise you that’s what i will do if i’m elected.  
2933,2020-01-16,<JoeBiden>, the character of our nation is on the ballot in this election. we are so much better than who donald trump thinks we are — and we have to prove that this november.  
2934,2020-01-16,<JoeBiden>," if true, this constitutes an unprecedented attack on our foreign service. amb. yovanovitch spent her life advancing u.s. interests, only to be defamed by this administration. our diplomats deserve better. it's inexcusable that sec. pompeo won't defend them.
"
2935,2020-01-15,<JoeBiden>," america has never lived up to our promise of equality for all, but we've never stopped trying. virginia brought us closer to that highest ideal today by ratifying the long overdue #era.  women's rights should be explicitly in our constitution—not left to the whims of legislators.
"
2936,2020-01-15,<JoeBiden>," i'm more optimistic about our future today than i was when i got elected to the senate as a 29-year-old. if we come together and unite this country, there's not a single thing we can't do.  "
2937,2020-01-15,<JoeBiden>," my thoughts and prayers are with mustafa kassem's family at this difficult time. his death, after six years in an egyptian jail, is an outrage. americans unjustly detained anywhere in the world deserve our government’s full support and relentless efforts to secure their release.
"
2938,2020-01-15,<JoeBiden>," this seems like a great reason to rejoin the paris agreement, "
2939,2020-01-15,<JoeBiden>," i’m proud that today, our campaign is launching hbcu students for biden. this program will be dedicated to helping hbcu students throughout the country learn how to organize for our campaign.   sign up here:  "
2940,2020-01-15,<JoeBiden>," i'm ready to debate donald trump on the economy. the american people are getting clobbered, and the wealthy are the only ones doing well. we have to rebuild the middle class, and this time, make sure everyone comes along.  "
2941,2020-01-15,<JoeBiden>," cornell is right — everything is at stake this november. we have to get donald trump out of the white house and unite this country. because if we come together and act as one america, there is nothing that we can't accomplish.  "
2942,2020-01-15,<JoeBiden>," historically black colleges and universities have always been the heartbeat of our country’s fight for justice. that’s why i’ll invest $70 billion in hbcus and minority-serving institutions.  when hbcus rise, we all rise—join hbcu students for biden today:  "
2943,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," i just got off the debate stage in iowa, where we're in the homestretch before the caucus. with just 19 days left, every dollar counts.  chip in if you're ready to take back this country and make donald trump a one-term president:  "
2944,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," this is the united states of america. there’s not a single thing beyond our capacity, if we do it together. let’s go do it. #demdebate
"
2945,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," with just 20 days until the iowa caucus, we need your help to fuel our campaign. every donation—big or small—goes a long way in this homestretch.  if you liked what you heard at tonight's #demdebate, please chip in what you can to keep our momentum going:  "
2946,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," look, i’ve been the object of donald trump’s affection now more than anyone else on this stage. i’ve taken all the hits he’s delivered, and i’m only getting stronger in the polls. #demdebate
"
2947,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," republicans have savaged my only surviving son. they’ve spread lies about me that networks won’t even carry. it doesn’t matter if they go after me.  as president of the united states, i have to be able to not only fight — i have to heal. and that’s what i’ll do if i’m elected.
"
2948,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," child care is personal to me: i was a single parent as a young senator. i commuted home to delaware every night to tuck my kids into bed. child care should be affordable for every parent. #demdebate
"
2949,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," make no mistake, the situation with iran is a crisis of donald trump’s own making. he claimed walking away from the iran deal would deter iranian aggression and result in a better deal. he failed on both accounts.  "
2950,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," under the biden administration, labor and environmental groups will be at the table to negotiate trade agreements. period.  "
2951,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," medicare should be able to negotiate prices with drug companies. #demdebate
"
2952,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," i’ve been very clear about what my health care plan would do: build on obamacare by giving americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system easier to navigate. #demdebate
"
2953,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," if we don’t write the global rules of the road for trade, cyber, climate change, and so much more, they may be written by china or other nations that don’t share our values. #demdebate
"
2954,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," i wouldn’t meet with kim jong un without pre-conditions. by meeting with him, donald trump gave kim jong un what he was looking for: legitimacy. i will work closely with our allies and hold china accountable for its lack of pressure on the kim regime’s bad behavior. #demdebate
"
2955,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," no president can take our country to war without the informed consent of the american people. #demdebate
"
2956,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," there’s a big difference between sending tens of thousands of american combat troops to the middle east indefinitely – which i oppose and will end – and using small teams of special forces to support local forces doing the fighting to advance our common security. #demdebate
"
2957,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," no one should shed a tear for qassem soleimani. but trump’s reckless escalation and thoughtless withdrawal from the iran nuclear deal has made america less safe. we need a return to diplomacy and a steady hand at the wheel to navigate an increasingly dangerous world. #demdebate
"
2958,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," when trump discarded the iran nuclear deal he promised it would produce a “better” one and curb iranian aggression—the reverse happened. iran has restarted its nuclear program and become more provocative. i’ll return to smart, disciplined diplomacy to address the threats we face.
"
2959,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," in 2009 president obama asked me to oversee our effort to bring home our combat troops. i’ll put my record and my judgment up against anyone in terms of who is the right person to be commander in chief. #demdebate
"
2960,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," i’m about to step on stage for tonight’s #demdebate in iowa. make sure to follow along here and on  for updates throughout the night, and tune in to  at 9 pm et to watch live!
"
2961,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," so much of what’s tearing this country apart can be fixed if we treat each other with basic dignity and respect once again. that starts with having a president who leads by example.
"
2962,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," donald trump has once again sided with corporations over american workers by making it easier for them to get away with wage theft and overtime violations.  it's time we put workers' rights over corporate greed and ensure everyone has the workplace protections they deserve.
"
2963,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," we’re in a battle for the soul of our nation — and donald trump is poison to our soul. he has:  - fanned the flames of hatred and bigotry - embraced dictators - ripped children from their parents' arms - degraded our national character  we have to get him out of the white house.
"
2964,2020-01-14,<JoeBiden>," why are you so obsessed with me, mr. president?  "
2965,2020-01-13,<JoeBiden>," i'm married to a teacher, i see firsthand how difficult it is. we've got to let educators do their job so our students can succeed - that means paying them the salaries they deserve and giving them the respect that they've earned.
"
2966,2020-01-13,<JoeBiden>," from day one, donald trump has been determined to roll back every environmental protection he could get his hands on.  at a time when the climate crisis is pushing our planet to the brink, we should strengthen protections — not weaken them.
"
2967,2020-01-13,<JoeBiden>," the stakes of this election could not be higher. eight years of donald trump will fundamentally alter the character of our nation. we can't let that happen.  we have to do everything in our power to make him a one-term president.
"
2968,2020-01-13,<JoeBiden>," when we said to give us your tired, poor, and huddled masses, we absolutely did not mean ""unless they are fleeing violence.""
"
2969,2020-01-13,<JoeBiden>," transit workers are being attacked every day, often while buses are moving, putting bus drivers and riders in harm's way. that's why i strongly support the transit worker and pedestrian protection act to protect our workers from harm while doing their job.
"
2970,2020-01-13,<JoeBiden>," donald trump has no strategy when it comes to iran. no endgame. the only way out of his self-made crisis is through diplomacy — clear-eyed, hard-nosed diplomacy grounded in strategy, that's not about one-off decisions or one-upmanship.  "
2971,2020-01-13,<JoeBiden>," come on. your administration has been arguing in court to repeal protections for people with pre-existing conditions.  you're trying to take health care away from millions of people. the least you could do is be honest about it.
"
2972,2020-01-13,<JoeBiden>," cory, you campaigned with joy and heart, and instead of just talking about bringing people together, you did it every day. you made our politics better just by running. grateful to you and looking forward to your continued leadership.
"
2973,2020-01-12,<JoeBiden>, puerto rico should not be treated any differently than if this happened anywhere else in america — it's wrong. we should be surging all the help that is needed to fix the damage done by the earthquakes.  
2974,2020-01-12,<JoeBiden>," there’s enormous opportunity once we get rid of donald trump. we can:  - address the climate emergency - build a more inclusive middle class - build on obamacare - ensure our government works for everyone — not just the powerful
"
2975,2020-01-12,<JoeBiden>," trump’s reckless policies have needlessly endangered our interests in the middle east. but none of us should be under any illusions about the iranian regime, and the iranian people — like all people everywhere — have the right to peaceful protest. the world should support them.
"
2976,2020-01-12,<JoeBiden>," gracias por su apoyo, mayor  estoy orgulloso de caminar junto a los bomberos, los angelenos, y los americanos. y hoy, me siento orgulloso de caminar junto a ti. vamos.  "
2977,2020-01-12,<JoeBiden>," thank you for your endorsement, mayor  i’m proud to walk with firefighters, angelenos, and americans. and today, i’m proud to walk with you. let’s do this.  "
2978,2020-01-11,<JoeBiden>," i want to congratulate my friend iowa attorney general tom miller on making history. i've known tom for years, he has never been afraid to take on the tough fights and has always served with honor and integrity—iowa and our nation are better because of it.  "
2979,2020-01-11,<JoeBiden>, i've seen firsthand how hard our educators work for little pay and with few resources. they deserve better. it's time we support our educators by giving them the pay and dignity they deserve.  
2980,2020-01-11,<JoeBiden>, what kind of nation are we if we simply accept that kids learn active shooter drills with their abcs? we have to take on the  and pass common-sense gun safety reforms to protect our children.  
2981,2020-01-11,<JoeBiden>," congratulations to president tsai and the people of taiwan for another successful election. you are stronger because of your free and open society. the united states should continue strengthening our ties with taiwan and other like-minded democracies.
"
2982,2020-01-11,<JoeBiden>, members of teamsters local 104 are striking against asarco for their unfair labor practices—i called into the picket line to support them. every company should provide its workers with the pay and benefits they've earned—especially one that pulls in over $1 billion in profits.  
2983,2020-01-10,<JoeBiden>," firefighters represent the best of america — courageous, selfless, and always answering the call to duty. i'm grateful to those who are heading to help our friends in australia battle devastating wildfires.
"
2984,2020-01-10,<JoeBiden>," being a nation of immigrants is and has always been one of our greatest strengths. our diversity has always made us stronger, but donald trump doesn’t get that.  "
2985,2020-01-10,<JoeBiden>, make no mistake: the situation with iran is a crisis of donald trump's own making. he brought us to the brink of war with no plan and no strategy.  he is the most erratic and incompetent commander in chief we've ever had.  
2986,2020-01-10,<JoeBiden>," i've released 21 years of my tax returns. why haven't you released any of yours, mr. president?  release your taxes or hush up about corruption.  "
2987,2020-01-10,<JoeBiden>, donald trump brought us dangerously close to starting a new war with iran without any semblance of a plan.  this moment requires a leader who will be ready on day one to pick up the pieces and repair the damage trump has caused.  
2988,2020-01-09,<JoeBiden>," i started the cancer moonshot so we could be the generation that finally cures cancer.  you then tried to slash nearly $1 billion for cancer funding.  we're lucky that the cancer rate is down, but we're luckier that congress stopped you.
"
2989,2020-01-09,<JoeBiden>, this election is about the soul of america — and a nation that allows our epidemic of school shootings to continue has a troubled soul. we have to beat the  and get weapons of war off our streets. lives depend on it.  
2990,2020-01-09,<JoeBiden>," facebook continues to put their profits over the truth — allowing politicians like donald trump to spend an unthinkable amount of money on paid disinformation. our democracy is worse off for their failure to confront this.
"
2991,2020-01-09,<JoeBiden>," we are so much better than who donald trump thinks we are. we don’t have to give in to his dark, petty, angry vision of america. we can choose to be the more perfect union we have always aspired to be — and restore the soul of this nation.  "
2992,2020-01-08,<JoeBiden>," instead of using his statement today to lay out a coherent strategy on iran, donald trump used it to mislead the country on the obama-biden record. he's been president for three years. it's time he stops blaming president obama for his failures.
"
2993,2020-01-08,<JoeBiden>," i'm thankful no one was hurt in last night's attack. but we're only in this mess because donald trump pulled out of the iran deal (which even his advisors said was working), turned his back on our allies, and had no strategy for what comes next.
"
2994,2020-01-08,<JoeBiden>," gabby is one of the strongest people i know. the resilience she has shown is remarkable. i'm inspired by her courage in turning tragedy into purpose and grateful for her relentless determination to make our country a safer place for all.
"
2995,2020-01-08,<JoeBiden>," 3,820 days — that's how long it's been since the federal minimum wage was last raised. it’s unacceptable. raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour nationwide should be just our starting point for ensuring workers receive the pay they deserve.  "
2996,2020-01-08,<JoeBiden>," pope francis is absolutely right. as a nation, we have a moral obligation to ensure everyone has access to the care they need. health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the few.  "
2997,2020-01-08,<JoeBiden>," we have to rebuild the middle class. but this time, we have to make sure that people historically left out of the middle class — whether due to race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or religion — have the chance to be included in our success.  "
2998,2020-01-07,<JoeBiden>," i’m going to hold off on commenting on the news tonight until we know more, but there is one thing i will say: jill and i are keeping our troops and americans overseas in our prayers. we hope you’ll keep them in yours.
"
2999,2020-01-07,<JoeBiden>," donald trump says he wants to end endless wars in the middle east, yet he is bringing us dangerously close to starting a new one.  "
3000,2020-01-07,<JoeBiden>," estoy con el pueblo de puerto rico, nuestros conciudadanos, en este momento de necesidad. es inconcebible que gran parte del arduo trabajo de la recuperación ante desastres aún no se haya hecho. tenemos que ofrecer apoyo concreto a puerto rico antes de que se pierdan más vidas.
"
3001,2020-01-07,<JoeBiden>," i stand with the people of puerto rico, our fellow citizens, in this moment of need. it’s unconscionable that so much of the hard work of disaster recovery continues to be left undone. we've got to deliver concrete support for puerto rico now before more lives are lost.
"
3002,2020-01-07,<JoeBiden>," nicolás maduro is a dictator. i strongly condemn his regime’s violent takeover of the venezuelan national assembly, the country’s sole remaining democratic institution.
"
3003,2020-01-07,<JoeBiden>, donald trump is the most reckless &amp; incompetent commander in chief we've ever had. every day he directs american national security is a dangerous day for the world.  we have to get him out of the white house. chip in to help make him a one-term president:  
3004,2020-01-07,<JoeBiden>," at 1:00 pm, i'll be speaking about the escalating situation with iran and the imperative need to restore respected, responsible, and dignified leadership on the world stage. tune in to watch live:  "
3005,2020-01-06,<JoeBiden>," trump wants to ignore climate science when making infrastructure decisions. in the biden administration, every dollar spent toward rebuilding our roads, bridges, buildings, the electric grid, and our water infrastructure will be used to reduce and withstand a changing climate.
"
3006,2020-01-06,<JoeBiden>," on día de los reyes, as christmas comes to a close, we are reminded of the call of the three kings: to give of ourselves without expectation, seek peace no matter how long the journey, and know that a bright future is within reach. jill and i wish a happy three kings’ day to all!
"
3007,2020-01-06,<JoeBiden>," let's be clear: donald trump does not have the authority to take us into war with iran without congressional approval. a president should never take this nation to war without the informed consent of the american people.
"
3008,2020-01-05,<JoeBiden>," i stand in solidarity with those marching in new york against the rise of anti-semitism. this is what the battle for the soul of our nation looks like — and it's up to all of us to reject intolerance in all its forms and give hate no safe harbor.
"
3009,2020-01-05,<JoeBiden>," our statue of liberty invites in the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. but donald trump has slammed the door in the face of families fleeing persecution and violence. jill traveled to matamoros to shed light on how these policies hurt asylum seekers.  "
3010,2020-01-05,<JoeBiden>," this is a crisis of donald trump’s own making. he claimed pulling out of the iran deal would deter iranian aggression and result in a better deal. he has failed on both counts.  he is the most erratic and incompetent commander in chief we’ve ever had.
"
3011,2020-01-05,<JoeBiden>, hey  do you think the american people want another war in the middle east? des moines certainly doesn’t.  
3012,2020-01-04,<JoeBiden>," the more the walls close in on this guy, the more irrational he becomes.  "

"
3590,2020-10-18,<realDonaldTrump>," joe biden is a corrupt politician, and everybody knows it. now you have the proof, perhaps like never was had before on a major politician. laptop plus. this is the second biggest political scandal in our history!
"
3591,2020-10-18,<realDonaldTrump>," hunter biden’s laptop is a disaster for the entire biden family, but especially for his father, joe. it is now a proven fact, and cannot be denied, that all of that info is the real deal. that makes it impossible for “50%, or 10%” joe, to ever assume the office of the president!
"
3592,2020-10-18,<realDonaldTrump>," the united states shows more cases than other countries, which the lamestream fake news media pounces on daily, because it tests at such a high (and costly) level. no country in the world tests at this level. the more you test, the more cases you will be reporting. very simple!

"
3610,2020-10-17,<realDonaldTrump>," ....practically nothing. both senators became totally unelectable, couldn’t come even close to winning their primaries, and decided to drop out of politics and gracefully “retire”.  could be next, or perhaps the republicans should find a new and more viable candidate?
"
3611,2020-10-17,<realDonaldTrump>," senator little ben sasse of the great state of nebraska seems to be heading down the same inglorious path as former senators liddle’ bob corker, whose approval rating in tennessee went from 55% to 4%, &amp; jeff “the flake” flake, whose approval rating in arizona went from 56% to....
"
3612,2020-10-17,<realDonaldTrump>," ...nomination to run for a second term. then he went back to his rather stupid and obnoxious ways. must feel he can’t lose to a dem. little ben is a liability to the republican party, and an embarrassment to the great state of nebraska. other than that, he’s just a wonderful guy!
"
3613,2020-10-17,<realDonaldTrump>," the least effective of our 53 republican senators, and a person who truly doesn’t have what it takes to be great, is little ben sasse of nebraska, a state which i have gladly done so much to help.  was as nice as a rino can be until he recently won the republican....

3619,2020-10-16,<realDonaldTrump>," biden made another big mistake. he totally mixed up two crime bills. didn’t have a clue (as usual!). also, he freely used the term super predator!!!
"
3620,2020-10-16,<realDonaldTrump>," there is a nasty rumor out there that  of maine will not be supporting our great united states supreme court nominee. well, she didn’t support healthcare or my opening up 5000 square miles of ocean to maine, so why should this be any different. not worth the work!
"
3621,2020-10-16,<realDonaldTrump>," big t was not a reference to me, but rather to big tech, which should have been properly pointed out in twitter’s fake trending section!
"
3622,2020-10-16,<realDonaldTrump>," steve scully of  had a very bad week. when his name was announced, i said he would not be appropriate because of conflicts. i was right! then he said he was hacked, he wasn’t. i was right again! but his biggest mistake was “confiding” in a lowlife loser like the mooch. sad!

"
3636,2020-10-15,<realDonaldTrump>," i was right again! steve scully just admitted he was lying about his twitter being hacked. the debate was rigged! he was suspended from  indefinitely. the trump campaign was not treated fairly by the “commission”. did i show good instincts in being the first to know?
"
3637,2020-10-15,<realDonaldTrump>," if we don’t win, the radical left will destroy our country. biden refuses to answer questions on packing the scotus! dems will pack the court w/ radical left justices who will shred the #2a, empower violent mobs, and protect terrorists &amp; violent criminals!  "
3638,2020-10-15,<realDonaldTrump>," joe biden and the democrat socialists will kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments, dissolve your borders, release criminal aliens, raise your taxes, confiscate your guns, end fracking, destroy your suburbs, and drive god from the public square.  "
3639,2020-10-15,<realDonaldTrump>," if big tech persists, in coordination with the mainstream media, we must immediately strip them of their section 230 protections. when government granted these protections, they created a monster!  "

4348,2020-09-03,<realDonaldTrump>," nancy pelosi says she got “set up” by a beauty parlor owner. maybe the beauty parlor owner should be running the house of representatives instead of crazy nancy?
"
4349,2020-09-03,<realDonaldTrump>," crazy nancy pelosi said she was “set up” by the beauty parlor owner when she improperly had the salon opened (and didn’t wear a mask!). does anyone want a speaker of the house who can be so easily set up?

"
4352,2020-09-03,<realDonaldTrump>," ....after you vote, which it should not, that ballot will not be used or counted in that your vote has already been cast &amp; tabulated. you are now assured that your precious vote has been counted, it hasn’t been “lost, thrown out, or in any way destroyed”. god bless america!!!

4355,2020-09-03,<realDonaldTrump>," . should get his puppet new york prosecutors, who have been illegally after me and my family for years, to investigate his incompetent handling of the china virus, and all of the deaths caused by this incompetence. it is at minimum a nursing home scandal - 11,000 dead!
"
4356,2020-09-03,<realDonaldTrump>," sleepy joe hiden’ was acknowledged by his own people to have done a terrible job on a much easier situation, h1n1 swine flu. the obiden administration failed badly on this, &amp; now he sits back in his basement and criticizes every move we make on the china virus. doing great job!
"
4357,2020-09-03,<realDonaldTrump>," governors andrew cuomo of new york has the worst record on death and china virus. 11,000 people alone died in nursing homes because of his incompetence!
"
4358,2020-09-02,<realDonaldTrump>," my administration will do everything in its power to prevent weak mayors and lawless cities from taking federal dollars while they let anarchists harm people, burn buildings, and ruin lives and businesses. we’re putting them on notice today. "
4359,2020-09-02,<realDonaldTrump>," mayor wheeler just got harassed out of his own home in portland by so-called “friendly protesters”. the anarchists, agitators and looters treat him horribly, even though he is so nice and respectful to them. criminals only understand strength!

"
4364,2020-09-02,<realDonaldTrump>," when a kennedy loses a democrat primary in massachusetts, by a lot, it just shows how far left that party has gone. joe hiden’ will never be able to hold them back. life, 2nd a, energy, religion, jobs and the economy, would be totally obliterated!

"
4367,2020-09-02,<realDonaldTrump>," we had far more people (many millions) watching us at the rnc than did sleepy joe and the dnc, and yet an ad just ran saying the opposite. this is what we’re up against. lies. but we will win!
"
4368,2020-09-02,<realDonaldTrump>," the beauty parlor owner must really dislike crazy nancy pelosi. turning her in, on tape, is a really big deal. she probably treats him like she treats everyone else...and she strongly supported a kennedy who just lost in, of all places, massachusetts!
"
4369,2020-09-02,<realDonaldTrump>," joe biden is a low energy candidate the likes of which we have never seen before. the last thing our country needs is a low energy individual, especially when surrounded by high energy chess players scattered all over the world. he’s back in his basement now - no schedule!
"
4370,2020-09-02,<realDonaldTrump>," crazy nancy pelosi is being decimated for having a beauty parlor opened, when all others are closed, and for not wearing a mask - despite constantly lecturing everyone else. we will almost certainly take back the house, and send nancy packing!

4371,2020-09-02,<realDonaldTrump>," seriously, is this what our great usa wants as its leader?
"
4372,2020-09-02,<realDonaldTrump>," joe biden is not on the side of law enforcement, and that was spectacularly evident on my very successful trip yesterday to kenosha. we solved the problem quickly, and it was very much appreciated by the people of wisconsin. joe biden wouldn’t know where to begin - a bad record!
"
4373,2020-09-02,<realDonaldTrump>," the unsolicited ballots scam is their only hope. will be the most corrupt election in history, by far!

"
4384,2020-09-01,<realDonaldTrump>," drudge didn’t support me in 2016, and i hear he doesn’t support me now. maybe that’s why he is doing poorly. his fake news report on mini-strokes is incorrect. possibly thinking about himself, or the other party’s “candidate”.

"
4388,2020-09-01,<realDonaldTrump>," it never ends! now they are trying to say that your favorite president, me, went to walter reed medical center, having suffered a series of mini-strokes. never happened to this candidate - fake news. perhaps they are referring to another candidate from another party!

"
4396,2020-08-31,<realDonaldTrump>," just watched what biden had to say. to me, he’s blaming the police far more than he’s blaming the rioters, anarchists, agitators, and looters, which he could never blame or he would lose the radical left bernie supports!
"
4397,2020-08-31,<realDonaldTrump>," the radical left mayors &amp;  governors of cities where this crazy violence is taking place have lost control of their “movement”. it wasn’t supposed to be like this, but the anarchists &amp; agitators got carried away and don’t listen anymore - even forced slow joe out of basement!
"
4398,2020-08-31,<realDonaldTrump>," i’ve been getting really good polls, some over 50%, except for one fake poll done by  news, which gives no information about the sample, r or d, or anything else. they did this last election, with one week to go, down 12 points, and i won. they are disgusting fake news!
"
4399,2020-08-31,<realDonaldTrump>," portland is a mess, and it has been for many years. if this joke of a mayor doesn’t clean it up, we will go in and do it for them!
"
4400,2020-08-31,<realDonaldTrump>," if i didn’t insist on having the national guard activate and go into kenosha, wisconsin, there would be no kenosha right now. also, there would have been great death and injury. i want to thank law enforcement and the national guard. i will see you on tuesday!

"
4402,2020-08-30,<realDonaldTrump>," when is slow joe biden going to criticize the anarchists, thugs &amp; agitators in antifa? when is he going to suggest bringing up the national guard in badly run &amp; crime infested democrat cities &amp; states? remember, he can’t lose the crazy bernie super liberal vote!
"
4403,2020-08-30,<realDonaldTrump>," ....his problem is interesting. he must always be weak on crime because of the bernie sanders radical left voter. if he loses them, like crooked hillary did, he is “toast”, and many will vote for me because of trade (bernie was good on trade). joe must always be weak on crime!
"
4404,2020-08-30,<realDonaldTrump>," joe biden is coming out of the basement earlier than his hoped for ten days because his people told him he has no choice, his poll numbers are plunging! going to pittsburgh, where i have helped industry to a record last year, &amp; then back to his  basement for an extended period...
"
4405,2020-08-30,<realDonaldTrump>," rushing him out of basement after seeing some very disturbing numbers. don’t worry, he’ll go back to basement soon!
"
4406,2020-08-30,<realDonaldTrump>," a weak and pathetic democrat mayor!!!
"
4407,2020-08-30,<realDonaldTrump>," the only way you will stop the violence in the high crime democrat run cities is through strength!
"
4408,2020-08-30,<realDonaldTrump>," ..the people of portland, like all other cities &amp;  parts of our great country, want law &amp; order. the radical left democrat mayors, like the dummy running portland, or the guy right now in his basement unwilling to lead or even speak out against crime, will never be able to do it!
"
4409,2020-08-30,<realDonaldTrump>," ....he tried mixing with the agitators and anarchists and they mocked him. he would like to blame me and the federal government for going in, but he hasn’t seen anything yet. we have only been there with a small group to defend our u.s. courthouse, because he couldn’t do it....
"
4410,2020-08-30,<realDonaldTrump>," ted wheeler, the wacky radical left do nothing democrat mayor of portland, who has watched great death and destruction of his city during his tenure, thinks this lawless situation should go on forever. wrong! portland will never recover with a fool for a mayor....
"
4411,2020-08-30,<realDonaldTrump>," moving along nicely. maga!

4416,2020-08-30,<realDonaldTrump>," democrat “leadership” has no clue. request help now....problem over!!!
"
4417,2020-08-30,<realDonaldTrump>," wheeler is incompetent, much like sleepy joe biden. this is not what our great country wants. they want safety &amp; security, and do not want to defund our police!
"
4418,2020-08-30,<realDonaldTrump>," the big backlash going on in portland cannot be unexpected after 95 days of watching and incompetent mayor admit that he has no idea what he is doing. the people of portland won’t put up with no safety any longer.the mayor is a fool. bring in the national guard!
"
4419,2020-08-30,<realDonaldTrump>," everything a governor asked the federal government for with respect to the pandemic, they got. they all said, on tape, the federal government did a great job. governor cuomo used the word “phenomenal.” the task force worked well with the states. feds bailed out many states!
"
4420,2020-08-29,<realDonaldTrump>, u.s. planning to cut military presence in iraq -  
4421,2020-08-29,<realDonaldTrump>," the thugs who accosted senator  and his wonderful wife, kelly, together with those who made threats to many other people who had just attended the republican national convention at the white house, must be sought out and immediately arrested. well documented evidence!

"
4423,2020-08-29,<realDonaldTrump>," probably shifty schiff, but others also, leak information to the fake news. no matter what or who it is about, including china, these deranged lowlifes like the russia, russia, russia narrative. plays better for them.  doing a great job!

"
4427,2020-08-29,<realDonaldTrump>," now that biden’s polls are dropping fast, he has agreed to get out of his basement and start campaignin,“in ten days.” sadly, that is a very slow reaction time for a president. our beloved usa needs a much faster, smarter, and tougher response than that. get out there today, joe!
"
4428,2020-08-29,<realDonaldTrump>," ..even whether it’s dumb warmongers like john bolton, social pretenders like bob woodward, who never has anything good to say, or an unstable niece, who was now rightfully shunned, scorned and mocked her entire life, and never even liked by her own very kind &amp; caring grandfather!
"
4429,2020-08-29,<realDonaldTrump>," about the only way a person is able to write a book on me is if they agree that it will contain as much bad “stuff” as possible, much of which is lies. it’s like getting a job with cnn or msdnc and saying that “president trump is great.” you have zero chance. fake news!
"
4430,2020-08-29,<realDonaldTrump>," i saved the iron range from the obama closure. we opened it up again, proudly. also sent the national guard the minneapolis to squelch a big problem. it worked, and quickly!!!

"
4434,2020-08-29,<realDonaldTrump>," the fake news doesn’t want to report these numbers. the  and others believed the crooked dems before the real numbers came out. too bad we don’t have honest reporting when it comes to “trump”. phony sources, they say anything and think they get away with it. november 3rd.

"
4437,2020-08-29,<realDonaldTrump>," wow! despite the democrats views across tv and online lie (con!), we had 147.9 million, the republican national convention blew the democrat national convention  away. not even close! just like their lies on russia, football (play!) and everything else! november 3rd.

4438,2020-08-29,<realDonaldTrump>," the democrats see chaos as their way while president trump sees the rule of law. mayor  thank you ken!
"
4439,2020-08-28,<realDonaldTrump>," kenosha has been very quiet for the third night in a row or, since the national guard has shown up. that’s the way it works, it’s all very simple. portland, with a very ungifted mayor, should request help from the federal government. if lives are endangered, we’re going in!
"
4440,2020-08-28,<realDonaldTrump>," disgraceful that big ten is not playing football. let them play!
"
4441,2020-08-28,<realDonaldTrump>," how does the fake news not include online streaming numbers where republicans blow the dem numbers away?
"
4442,2020-08-28,<realDonaldTrump>," great total numbers for the republican national convention. blows democrat national convention away. also, much bigger fund raising numbers!
"
4443,2020-08-28,<realDonaldTrump>," if the incompetent mayor of portland, ted wheeler, doesn’t get control of his city and stop the anarchists, agitators, rioters and looters, causing great danger to innocent people, we will go in and take care of matters the way they should have been taken care of 100 days ago!

"
4447,2020-08-28,<realDonaldTrump>," no, i want big ten, and all other football, back - now. the dems don’t want football back, for political reasons, but are trying to blame me and the republicans. another lie, but this is what we are up against! they should also open up all of their shutdown states.

"
4449,2020-08-28,<realDonaldTrump>," success: since the national guard moved into kenosha, wisconsin, two days ago, there has been no further violence, not even a small problem. when legally asked to help by local authorities, the federal government will act and quickly succeed. are you listening portland?

"
4451,2020-08-27,<realDonaldTrump>," democrats hate that i called for big pharma to match the lowest prescription drug prices in the world by using a favored nations clause. prices will plunge!
"
4452,2020-08-27,<realDonaldTrump>," democrats and biden didn’t even mention the anarchists, agitators, looters and so called “peaceful protesters” at their convention. they will allow rampant crime, just as they do in portland. if they ask us, as they must do, we will end crime in their democrat run cities, fast!
"
4453,2020-08-27,<realDonaldTrump>," the ten most dangerous cities in the u.s. are all run by democrats, and this has gone on for decades!

"
4455,2020-08-26,<realDonaldTrump>," we will not stand for looting, arson, violence, and lawlessness on american streets. my team just got off the phone with governor evers who agreed to accept federal assistance (portland should do the same!)...
"

4724,2020-08-01,<realDonaldTrump>," wrong! we have more cases because we have tested far more than any other country, 60,000,000. if we tested less, there would be less cases. how did italy, france &amp; spain do? now europe sadly has flare ups. most of our governors worked hard &amp; smart. we will come back strong!  ::

"
4739,2020-07-31,<realDonaldTrump>," somebody please tell congressman clyburn, who doesn’t have a clue, that the chart he put up indicating more cases for the u.s. than europe, is because we do much more testing than any other country in the world. if we had no testing, or bad testing, we would show very few cases..

"
4753,2020-07-30,<realDonaldTrump>," mail-in voting is already proving to be a catastrophic disaster. even testing areas are way off. the dems talk of foreign influence in voting, but they know that mail-in voting is an easy way for foreign countries to enter the race. even beyond that, there’s no accurate count!

4781,2020-07-27,<realDonaldTrump>," the fake news media is trying to portray the portland and seattle “protesters” as wonderful, sweet and innocent people just out for a little stroll. actually, they are sick and deranged anarchists &amp; agitators who our great men &amp; women of law enforcement easily control, but who...

"
4783,2020-07-27,<realDonaldTrump>," so disgusting to watch twitter’s so-called “trending”, where sooo many trends are about me, and never a good one. they look for anything they can find, make it as bad as possible, and blow it up, trying to make it trend. really ridiculous, illegal, and, of course, very unfair!

"
4785,2020-07-27,<realDonaldTrump>," homeland security or federal forces are little involved in seattle, other than we have a large standby team in case of emergency. the media is calling that one wrong also. in portland, we are protecting federal property, including the courthouse, which wouldn’t last a day!

"
4787,2020-07-26,<realDonaldTrump>," he is, and people are not happy about it. the washington post is a political front for amazon. nobody treated ronald reagan worse!
"
4788,2020-07-26,<realDonaldTrump>," we do more testing than any country in the world, by far, over 55 million tests. fake news  says we should do more testing. but even if we did 100 times more, they would then say it is still not enough. they are totally discredited, just want sleepy joe to win in november!
"
4789,2020-07-26,<realDonaldTrump>," the “protesters” are actually anarchists who hate our country. the line of innocent “mothers” were a scam that lamestream refuses to acknowledge, just like they don’t report the violence of these demonstrations!
"
4790,2020-07-26,<realDonaldTrump>," the 2020 election will be totally rigged if mail-in voting is allowed to take place, &amp; everyone knows it. so much time is taken talking about foreign influence, but the same people won’t even discuss mail-in election corruption. look at patterson, n.j. 20% of vote was corrupted!
"
4791,2020-07-26,<realDonaldTrump>," because of my strong focus on the china virus, including scheduled meetings on vaccines, our economy and much else, i won’t be able to be in new york to throw out the opening pitch for the  on august 15th. we will make it later in the season!
"
4792,2020-07-26,<realDonaldTrump>," the lamestream media, including  which has really checked out, is refusing to show what is really going on in portland, seattle, and other places. they want the american public to believe that these are just some wonderful protesters, not radical left anarchists!
"
4793,2020-07-26,<realDonaldTrump>," there is no way a place like pennsylvania can vote for the radical left and their puppet, joe biden, when they are against fracking, steel production, and just about everything else that pennsylvania stands for. likewise, texas, and many other states!!!
"
4794,2020-07-26,<realDonaldTrump>," so the washington post is running the reagan foundation, and rino paul ryan is on the board of fox, which has been terrible. we will win anyway, even with the phony  suppression polls (which have been seriously wrong for 5 years)!
"
4795,2020-07-26,<realDonaldTrump>," the trump campaign has more enthusiasm, according to many, than any campaign in the history of our great country - even more than 2016. biden has none! the silent majority will speak on november third!!! fake suppression polls &amp; fake news will not save the radical left.
"
4796,2020-07-26,<realDonaldTrump>," crazy nancy pelosi said i made a mistake when i banned people from infected china from entering the u.s. in january. tens of thousands of lives were saved, as she danced in the streets of chinatown (sf) in late february. biden agreed with her, but soon admitted that i was right!

"
4798,2020-07-26,<realDonaldTrump>," this week you had joe biden call arizona a city. nothing matters with him, however, because the opposition party (lamestream media) covers everything up - especially the corruption. the obama/biden administration is the most corrupt in history. they even spied on my campaign!

"
4803,2020-07-25,<realDonaldTrump>," the democrats in the house are trying to undo my big win travel ban bill, which successfully keeps very bad and dangerous people out of our great country. passed along party lines. hopefully, will be dead in the senate! the dems have gone stone cold left - venezuela on steroids!
"
4804,2020-07-25,<realDonaldTrump>," ...to virtual pennies. epi-pens went from their incredibly high, jacked up prices, to lower than their original give away bargains. biggest price reductions in history, by far! nothing like this has ever for our citizens, especially our seniors. remember your favorite president!
"
4805,2020-07-25,<realDonaldTrump>," yesterday i signed four measures that will massively reduce the prices of prescription drugs, in many cases by more than 50%. nothing like this has ever been done before because big pharma, with its vast power, would not let it happen. expensive insulin went from big dollars.....
"
4806,2020-07-24,<realDonaldTrump>," congratulations jim. it was a great and beautiful event. well deserved!
"
4807,2020-07-24,<realDonaldTrump>," so obama and his team of lowlifes spied on my campaign, and got caught - open and shut case! more papers released today which are devastating to them. will they ever pay the price? the political crime of the century!

"
4809,2020-07-24,<realDonaldTrump>," i spoke to highly respected (chairman) senator  who has informed me that he will not be changing the names of our great military bases and forts, places from which we won two world wars (and more!). like me, jim is not a believer in “cancel culture”.
"
4810,2020-07-24,<realDonaldTrump>," great job by  in agreeing to build, in texas, what is expected to be the largest auto plant anywhere in the world. he kept his word to me. texas &amp;  are big winners. made in the usa!

"
4814,2020-07-23,<realDonaldTrump>," the suburban housewives of america must read this article. biden will destroy your neighborhood and your american dream. i will preserve it, and make it even better!  "
4815,2020-07-23,<realDonaldTrump>," obama, who wouldn’t even endorse biden until everyone else was out of the primaries (and even then waited a long time!), is now making a commercial of support. remember, i wouldn’t even be here if it weren’t for them. i wouldn’t be president. they did a terrible job!
"
4816,2020-07-23,<realDonaldTrump>," the democrats have stated strongly that they won’t approve a payroll tax cut (too bad!). it would be great for workers. the republicans, therefore, didn’t want to ask for it. dems, as usual, are hurting the working men and women of our country!
"
4817,2020-07-23,<realDonaldTrump>," recently watched failed rino tom ridge, former head of homeland security, trying to justify his sudden love of the radical left mayor of portland, who last night was booed &amp; shouted out of existence by the agitators &amp; anarchists. love watching pathetic never trumpers squirm!

"
4819,2020-07-23,<realDonaldTrump>," john bolton is, with the exception of hillary, by far the worst offender of them all!

4820,2020-07-23,<realDonaldTrump>," great, but did maga have anything to do with this great ratings success?
"
4821,2020-07-23,<realDonaldTrump>," liz cheney is only upset because i have been actively getting our great and beautiful country out of the ridiculous and costly endless wars. i am also making our so-called allies pay tens of billions of dollars in delinquent military costs. they must, at least, treat us fairly!!!
"
4822,2020-07-22,<realDonaldTrump>," i am deeply saddened by the loss of my friend charles evers. charles was a trail blazer in politics and a fearless leader, alongside his brother medgar, for civil rights.  "
4823,2020-07-22,<realDonaldTrump>," we must protect our national parks for our children and grandchildren. i am calling on the house to pass the great american outdoors act today. thanks  and  for all your work on this historic bill!

5318,2020-06-05,<realDonaldTrump>," . is grossly incompetent, and in no way qualified to be running an important city like washington, d.c. if the great men and women of the national guard didn’t step forward, she would have looked no better than her counterpart mayor in minneapolis!
"
5319,2020-06-05,<realDonaldTrump>," ...we should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a hand on heart. there are other things you can protest, but not our great american flag - no kneeling!
"
5320,2020-06-05,<realDonaldTrump>," i am a big fan of drew brees. i think he’s truly one of the greatest quarterbacks, but he should not have taken back his original stance on honoring our magnificent american flag. old glory is to be revered, cherished, and flown high...

"
5340,2020-06-04,<realDonaldTrump>," sleepy joe biden’s 1994 crime bill was a total disaster. it was mass incarceration for black people, many of them innocent. i did criminal justice reform, something obama &amp; biden didn’t even try to do - &amp; couldn’t do even if they did try. biden can never escape his crime bill!

5345,2020-06-04,<realDonaldTrump>," the problem with asking for someone to give you a letter of resignation, which you do as a courtesy to help them save face, is that it is then harder to say you fired them. i did fire james mattis. he was no good for obama, who fired him also, and was no good for me!
"
5346,2020-06-04,<realDonaldTrump>," ...in my inner-circle, was totally exhausted by the job, and in the end just slinked away into obscurity. they all want to come back for a piece of the limelight!

"
5348,2020-06-04,<realDonaldTrump>," the problem is not the very talented, low-flying helicopter pilots wanting to save our city, the problem is the arsonists, looters, criminals, and anarchists, wanting to destroy it (and our country)!

"
5355,2020-06-04,<realDonaldTrump>," the radical left democrats new theme is “defund the police”. remember that when you don’t want crime, especially against you and your family. this is where sleepy joe is being dragged by the socialists. i am the complete opposite, more money for law enforcement! #lawandorder

"
5364,2020-06-03,<realDonaldTrump>," fbi &amp; doj had no evidence to start an investigation against president trump.   “these are people with subversive actions and outright lies. they doctored documents.”    now proven conclusively that this was the political crime of the century!

"
5366,2020-06-03,<realDonaldTrump>," i feel more and more confident that our economy is in the early stages of coming back very strong. not everyone agrees with me, but i have little doubt. watch for september, october, november. next year will be one of the best ever, and look at the stock market now!
"
5367,2020-06-03,<realDonaldTrump>," ...his primary strength was not military, but rather personal public relations. i gave him a new life, things to do, and battles to win, but he seldom “brought home the bacon”. i didn’t like his “leadership” style or much else about him, and many others agree. glad he is gone!
"
5368,2020-06-03,<realDonaldTrump>," probably the only thing barack obama &amp; i have in common is that we both had the honor of firing jim mattis, the world’s most overrated general. i asked for his letter of resignation, &amp; felt great about it. his nickname was “chaos”, which i didn’t like, &amp; changed to “mad dog”...
"
5369,2020-06-03,<realDonaldTrump>," ....the possible exception of another republican president, the late, great, abraham lincoln...and it’s not even close. the democrats know this, and so does the fake news, but they refuse to write or say it because they are inherently corrupt! see “pinned” above.
"
5370,2020-06-03,<realDonaldTrump>," in 3 1/2 years, i’ve done much more for our black population than joe biden has done in 43 years. actually, he set them back big time with his crime bill, which he doesn’t even remember. i’ve done more for black americans, in fact, than any president in u.s. history, with...
"
5371,2020-06-03,<realDonaldTrump>," if you watch fake news  or msdnc, you would think that the killers, terrorists, arsonists, anarchists, thugs, hoodlums, looters, antifa &amp; others, would be the nicest, kindest most wonderful people in the whole wide world. no, they are what they are - very bad for our country!
"
5372,2020-06-03,<realDonaldTrump>," really sick to watch the fake and totally slanted news(?) coming out of msdnc and cnn. it bears no relationship to the truth or facts. they are merely offshoots of the dnc, much like the  and the amazon  just like 2016, but worse. sad, but we will win big!

"
5376,2020-06-03,<realDonaldTrump>," undercover huber is a great spoof, funny, but at the same time sad, because the real  did absolutely nothing. he was a garbage disposal unit for important documents &amp; then, tap, tap, tap, just drag it along &amp; run out of time. a.g. jeff sessions was played like a drum!

"
5379,2020-06-02,<realDonaldTrump>," so pathetic to watch the fake news lamestream media playing down the gravity and depravity of the radical left, looters and thugs, ripping up our liberal democrat run (only) cities. it is almost like they are all working together?

5811,2020-04-30,<realDonaldTrump>," the do nothing democrats!
"
5812,2020-04-30,<realDonaldTrump>," dirty cop james comey got caught!
"
5813,2020-04-30,<realDonaldTrump>," fake polling, just like 2016 (but worse)!
"
5814,2020-04-30,<realDonaldTrump>," what happened to general michael flynn, a war hero, should never be allowed to happen to a citizen of the united states again!
"
5815,2020-04-30,<realDonaldTrump>," does anybody really believe that roger stone, a man whose house was raided early in the morning by 29 gun toting fbi agents (with fake news  closely in toe), was treated fairly. how about the jury forewoman with her unannounced hatred &amp; bias. same scammers as general flynn!
"
5816,2020-04-30,<realDonaldTrump>," despite reports to the contrary, sweden is paying heavily for its decision not to lockdown. as of today, 2462 people have died there, a much higher number than the neighboring countries of norway (207), finland (206) or denmark (443). the united states made the correct decision!
"
5817,2020-04-29,<realDonaldTrump>, lyin’ brian williams of msdnc!  
5818,2020-04-29,<realDonaldTrump>," i must admit that lyin’ brian williams is, while dumber than hell, quite a bit smarter than fake news  “anchorman” don lemon, the “dumbest man on television”. then you have psycho joe “what ever happened to your girlfriend?” scarborough, another of the low i.q. individuals!
"
5819,2020-04-29,<realDonaldTrump>," lyin’ brian williams of msdnc, a concast scam company, wouldn’t know the truth if it was nailed to his wooden forehead. remember when he lied about his bravery in a helicopter? totally made up story. he’s a true dummy who was thrown off network news like a dog. stay tuned!
"
5820,2020-04-29,<realDonaldTrump>," just told that fake news  is falsely reporting that i was recently shouting at my campaign manager over made up nonsense. actually, he is doing a great job, i never shouted at him (been with me for years, including the 2016 win), &amp; have no intention to do so. just fake news!
"
5821,2020-04-29,<realDonaldTrump>," . doesn’t want to speak about their persecution of general michael flynn &amp; why they got the story so wrong. they, along with others, should pay a big price for what they have purposely done to this man &amp; his family. they won’t even cover the big breaking news about this scam!
"
5822,2020-04-29,<realDonaldTrump>," happy birthday to three time olympian and five term congressman, "
5823,2020-04-29,<realDonaldTrump>," no, i think amash would make a wonderful candidate, especially since he is way behind in his district and has no chance of maintaining his congressional seat. he almost always votes for the do nothing dems anyway. i like him even more than jill stein!
"
5824,2020-04-29,<realDonaldTrump>," at least they admit it. the failing  &amp;  never correct their fake reporting!
"
5825,2020-04-28,<realDonaldTrump>," the only reason the u.s. has reported one million cases of coronavirus is that our testing is sooo much better than any other country in the world. other countries are way behind us in testing, and therefore show far fewer cases!
"
5826,2020-04-28,<realDonaldTrump>, thank you  and  #americastrong  
5827,2020-04-28,<realDonaldTrump>," but i love diamond &amp; silk, and so do millions of people!

5828,2020-04-28,<realDonaldTrump>, texas to open businesses in phases beginning friday. great job being done by 
5829,2020-04-28,<realDonaldTrump>," many states moving to safely &amp; quickly reopen!
"
5830,2020-04-28,<realDonaldTrump>," we are doing far more, and better, testing than any other country in the world, and yet the media does nothing but complain. no matter how good a job is done, the same as with the ventilators, they will never say we are doing a great job, they will only viciously gripe!
"
5831,2020-04-27,<realDonaldTrump>," because shifty is a crooked politician!
"
5832,2020-04-27,<realDonaldTrump>," i will be having a white house press conference today at 5:30 p.m. thank you!
"
5833,2020-04-27,<realDonaldTrump>," why should the people and taxpayers of america be bailing out poorly run states (like illinois, as example) and cities, in all cases democrat run and managed, when most of the other states are not looking for bailout help? i am open to discussing anything, but just asking?
"
5834,2020-04-27,<realDonaldTrump>," fake news, the enemy of the people!
"
5835,2020-04-27,<realDonaldTrump>," there has never been, in the history of our country, a more vicious or hostile lamestream media than there is right now, even in the midst of a national emergency, the invisible enemy!
"
5836,2020-04-27,<realDonaldTrump>," blame the democrats for any “lateness” in your enhanced unemployment insurance. i wanted the money to be paid directly, they insisted it be paid by states for distribution. i told them this would happen, especially with many states which have old computers.
"
5837,2020-04-26,<realDonaldTrump>," american citizens! we were long ahead of dems, who were all against the ban.
"
5838,2020-04-26,<realDonaldTrump>," they are one of the worst in the “news” business. total slime balls!
"

"
5840,2020-04-26,<realDonaldTrump>," laura, just another fake news report!
"
5841,2020-04-26,<realDonaldTrump>," does anybody get the meaning of what a so-called noble (not nobel) prize is, especially as it pertains to reporters and journalists? noble is defined as, “having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals.” does sarcasm ever work?
"
5842,2020-04-26,<realDonaldTrump>," reports that h.h.s. secretary  is going to be “fired” by me are fake news. the lamestream media knows this, but they are desperate to create the perception of chaos &amp; havoc in the minds of the public. they never even called to ask. alex is doing an excellent job!
"
5843,2020-04-26,<realDonaldTrump>," ....fraud  (and others who are even worse). chris wallace is nastier to republicans than even deface the nation or sleepy eyes. the people who are watching  in record numbers (thank you president trump), are angry. they want an alternative now. so do i!
"
5844,2020-04-26,<realDonaldTrump>," ....even the radical left do nothing democrats laughed at the fox suggestion. no respect for the people running  but fox keeps on plugging to try and become politically correct. they put rino paul ryan on their board. they hire “debate questions to crooked hillary”....
"
5845,2020-04-26,<realDonaldTrump>," . just doesn’t get what’s happening! they are being fed democrat talking points, and they play them without hesitation or research. they forgot that fake news  &amp; msdnc wouldn’t let  participate, even a little bit, in the poor ratings democrat debates.....
"
5846,2020-04-26,<realDonaldTrump>," ....schedule and eating habits, written by a third rate reporter who knows nothing about me. i will often be in the oval office late into the night &amp; read &amp; see that i am angrily eating a hamburger &amp; diet coke in my bedroom. people with me are always stunned. anything to demean!
"
5847,2020-04-26,<realDonaldTrump>," i work from early in the morning until late at night, haven’t left the white house in many months (except to launch hospital ship comfort) in order to take care of trade deals, military rebuilding etc., and then i read a phony story in the failing  about my work....
"
5848,2020-04-26,<realDonaldTrump>," the people that know me and know the history of our country say that i am  the hardest working president in history. i don’t know about that, but i am a hard worker and have probably gotten more done in the first 3 1/2 years than any president in history. the fake news hates it!
"
5849,2020-04-26,<realDonaldTrump>," .  thank you for a great call yesterday with catholic leaders, and a great service today from "

5852,2020-04-25,<realDonaldTrump>," i never said the pandemic was a hoax! who would say such a thing? i said that the do nothing democrats, together with their mainstream media partners, are the hoax. they have been called out &amp; embarrassed on this, even admitting they were wrong, but continue to spread the lie!
"
5853,2020-04-25,<realDonaldTrump>," remember, the cure can’t be worse than the problem itself. be careful, be safe, use common sense!
"
5854,2020-04-25,<realDonaldTrump>," what is the purpose of having white house news conferences when the lamestream media asks nothing but hostile questions, &amp; then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately. they get record ratings, &amp; the american people get nothing but fake news. not worth the time &amp; effort!
"
5855,2020-04-25,<realDonaldTrump>," was just informed that the fake news from the thursday white house press conference had me speaking &amp; asking questions of dr. deborah birx. wrong, i was speaking to our laboratory expert, not deborah, about sunlight etc. &amp; the coronavirus. the lamestream media is corrupt &amp; sick!
"
5856,2020-04-25,<realDonaldTrump>," if the wall street journal “editorial” writers had called, as they should have, they would have easily found that i was “not happy with the georgia governor on tuesday night.” you said the opposite, and got it wrong as you often do!
"
5857,2020-04-25,<realDonaldTrump>," the do nothing democrats are spending much of their money on fake ads. i never said that the coronavirus is a “hoax”, i said that the democrats, and the way they lied about it, are a hoax. also, it did start with “one person from china”, and then grew, &amp; will be a “miracle” end!
"
5858,2020-04-25,<realDonaldTrump>," we have now tested more than 5 million people. that is more than any other country in the world, and even more than  all major countries combined!
"
5859,2020-04-25,<realDonaldTrump>," it is a wonderful feeling to know that our states are loaded up with ventilators, many brand new and high quality just off of our production lines, and that we are now in a position to help other countries that so desperately need them. every person needing a ventilator got one!
"
5860,2020-04-25,<realDonaldTrump>," just spoke to prime minister abiy ahmed ali of ethiopia. his country needs ventilators, and the u.s. is in good position to help him. we will!
"
5861,2020-04-25,<realDonaldTrump>," many testing sites are, and have been, open &amp; available. just passed 5 million tests, far more than any other country in the world. in fact, more than all other major countries combined! don’t believe the fake news!

"
5868,2020-04-24,<realDonaldTrump>," great news! randall stephenson, the ceo of heavily indebted at&amp;t, which owns and presides over fake news  is leaving, or was forced out. anyone who lets a garbage “network” do and say the things that cnn does, should leave asap. hopefully replacement will be much better!
"
5869,2020-04-24,<realDonaldTrump>," i (or  never gave governor brian kemp an ok on those few businesses outside of the guidelines. fake news! spas, beauty salons, tattoo parlors, &amp; barber shops should take a little slower path, but i told the governor to do what is right for the great people of georgia (&amp; usa)!

"
5913,2020-04-21,<realDonaldTrump>," i’ve had great “ratings” my whole life, there’s nothing unusual about that for me. the white house news conference ratings are “through the roof”(monday night football, bachelor finale ,  but i don’t care about that. i care about going around the fake news to the people!
"
5914,2020-04-21,<realDonaldTrump>," it is amazing that i became president of the united states with such a totally corrupt and dishonest lamestream media going after me all day, and all night. either i’m really good, far better than the fake news wants to admit, or they don’t have nearly the power as once thought!
"
5915,2020-04-21,<realDonaldTrump>," watched the first 5 minutes of poorly rated morning psycho on msdnc just to see if he is as “nuts” as people are saying. he’s worse. such hatred and contempt! i used to do his show all the time before the 2016 election, then cut him off. wasn’t worth the effort, his mind is shot!

5924,2020-04-20,<realDonaldTrump>," ... “testing, testing, testing,” again playing a very dangerous political game. states, not the federal government, should be doing the testing - but we will work with the governors and get it done. this is easy compared to the fast production of thousands of complex ventilators!
"
5925,2020-04-20,<realDonaldTrump>," last month all you heard from the radical left, do nothing democrats was, “ventilators, ventilators, ventilators.” they screamed it loud &amp; clear, &amp; thought they had us cold, even though it was the state’s task. but everyone got their v’s, with many to spare. now they scream....

"
5932,2020-04-19,<realDonaldTrump>," nervous nancy is an inherently “dumb” person. she wasted all of her time on the impeachment hoax. she will be overthrown, either by inside or out, just like her last time as “speaker”. wallace &amp;  are on a bad path, watch!
"
5933,2020-04-19,<realDonaldTrump>," just like i was right on ventilators (our country is now the “king of ventilators”, other countries are calling asking for help-we will!), i am right on testing. governors must be able to step up and get the job done. we will be with you all the way!

"
6320,2020-03-09,<realDonaldTrump>," now the democrats are trying to smear bernie with russia, russia, russia. they are driving him crazy!
"
6321,2020-03-09,<realDonaldTrump>," elizabeth “pocahontas” warren singlehandedly destroyed the bernie sanders campaign by stripping voters away from his count on super t. he lost states that he easily would have won if she had dropped out 3 days earlier. the dnc is doing it to bernie again! will he ever get angry?
"
6322,2020-03-09,<realDonaldTrump>," cryin’ chuck schumer said, “you will pay the price for this. you won’t know what hit you.” that is far beyond simple rhetoric. that is a physical threat, or at least a threat that you better vote for us.” trouble ahead!
"
6323,2020-03-09,<realDonaldTrump>," the fake news media and their partner, the democrat party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the coronavirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. surgeon general, “the risk is low to the average american.”

6326,2020-03-08,<realDonaldTrump>," the new york times is an embarrassment to journalism. they were a dead paper before i went into politics, and they will be a dead paper after i leave, which will be in 5 years. fake news is the enemy of the people!
"
6327,2020-03-08,<realDonaldTrump>," we have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the white house for our attack on coronavirus. we moved very early to close borders to certain areas, which was a godsend. v.p. is doing a great job. the fake news media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. sad!
"
6328,2020-03-07,<realDonaldTrump>," .....least 5 states &amp; the nomination. did the dnc &amp; dems tell elizabeth warren to wait? if so, they were deadly, the race would have been over, &amp; bernie would have won. dirty double dealing? nobody knows for sure, &amp; history will be the judge. but i say, here we go again, bernie!

6350,2020-03-05,<realDonaldTrump>," elizabeth “pocahontas” warren, who was going nowhere except into mini mike’s head, just dropped out of the democrat primary...three days too late. she cost crazy bernie, at least, massachusetts, minnesota and texas. probably cost him the nomination! came in third in mass.
"
6351,2020-03-05,<realDonaldTrump>," . kevin mccarthy informed me that i was 20 for 20 on tuesday with respect to my endorsement of candidates. sadly, i didn’t get that information from the fake news media. they don’t report those things, or the far more than dems cumulative votes, despite no opposition!

6358,2020-03-04,<realDonaldTrump>," there can be few things worse in a civilized, law abiding nation, than a united states senator openly, and for all to see and hear, threatening the supreme court or its justices. this is what chuck schumer just did. he must pay a severe price for this!
"
6359,2020-03-04,<realDonaldTrump>," this is a direct &amp; dangerous threat to the u.s. supreme court by schumer. if a republican did this, he or she would be arrested, or impeached. serious action must be taken now!

"
6367,2020-03-04,<realDonaldTrump>," mini mike bloomberg just “quit” the race for president. i could have told him long ago that he didn’t have what it takes, and he would have saved himself a billion dollars, the real cost. now he will pour money into sleepy joe’s campaign, hoping to save face. it won’t work!
"
6368,2020-03-04,<realDonaldTrump>," the mayor of los angeles,  is dealing with us trying to get the federal government to fix the terrible problem he and the dems have caused with the homeless, and the horrendous effects it is having on the city, which is a mess. i then watch him talk “trash” on me!

6369,2020-03-04,<realDonaldTrump>," wow! if elizabeth warren wasn’t in the race, bernie sanders would have easily won massachusetts, minnesota and texas, not to mention various other states. our modern day pocahontas won’t go down in history as a winner, but she may very well go down as the all time great spoiler!

6373,2020-03-04,<realDonaldTrump>," this is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed attorney general of the united states &amp; then doesn’t have the wisdom or courage to stare down &amp; end the phony russia witch hunt. recuses himself on first day in office, and the mueller scam begins!
"
6374,2020-03-04,<realDonaldTrump>," so selfish for elizabeth warren to stay in the race. she has zero chance of even coming close to winning, but hurts bernie badly. so much for their wonderful liberal friendship. will he ever speak to her again? she cost him massachusetts (and came in third), he shouldn’t!
"
6375,2020-03-04,<realDonaldTrump>," the democrat establishment came together and crushed bernie sanders, again! even the fact that elizabeth warren stayed in the race was devastating to bernie and allowed sleepy joe to unthinkably win massachusetts. it was a perfect storm, with many good states remaining for joe!

"
6380,2020-03-03,<realDonaldTrump>," the biggest loser tonight, by far, is mini mike bloomberg. his “political” consultants took him for a ride. $700 million washed down the drain, and he got nothing for it but the nickname mini mike, and the complete destruction of his reputation. way to go mike!

"
6675,2020-02-08,<realDonaldTrump>," can’t say i mind the fact that the great people of west virginia are furious at their puppet democrat senator, joe manchin. they will never forget his phony vote on the impeachment hoax. all he had to do is read the transcripts, sadly, which he wouldn’t understand anyway.....

"
6685,2020-02-08,<realDonaldTrump>," the only way to stop the crazed radical left, do nothing democrats “is for the republican senate to run an offense here”.      so true, although the dems hoaxes &amp; witch hunts have driven up republican polls, and mine, mightily!
"
6686,2020-02-08,<realDonaldTrump>," crazy nancy pelosi’s impeachment hoax has lifted republican congressional polls (she lost the house once before!), and my polls, way up, which was expected, but it has had a great effect on republican senate races, including north carolina, kentucky, colorado and arizona. thanks!
"
6687,2020-02-08,<realDonaldTrump>," thank you iowa for the record vote we just received in the primary. the dems were 25% down (although their votes are all fried!).

"
6689,2020-02-08,<realDonaldTrump>," fake news  &amp; msdnc keep talking about “lt. col.” vindman as though i should think only how wonderful he was. actually, i don’t know him, never spoke to him, or met him (i don’t believe!) but, he was very insubordinate, reported contents of my “perfect” calls incorrectly, &amp;...

6692,2020-02-07,<realDonaldTrump>," i was very surprised &amp; disappointed that senator joe manchin of west virginia voted against me on the democrat’s totally partisan impeachment hoax. no president has done more for the great people of west virginia than me (pensions), and that will....

6717,2020-02-04,<realDonaldTrump>," it is not the fault of iowa, it is the do nothing democrats fault. as long as i am president, iowa will stay where it is. important tradition!
"
6718,2020-02-04,<realDonaldTrump>," the democrat caucus is an unmitigated disaster. nothing works, just like they ran the country. remember the  5 billion dollar obamacare website, that should have cost 2% of that. the only person that can claim a very big victory in iowa last night is “trump”.

6730,2020-02-01,<realDonaldTrump>," mini mike is now negotiating both to get on the democrat primary debate stage, and to have the right to stand on boxes, or a lift, during the debates. this is sometimes done, but really not fair!
"
6731,2020-02-01,<realDonaldTrump>," many of the ads you are watching were paid for by mini mike bloomberg. he is going nowhere, just wasting his money, but he is getting the dnc to rig the election against crazy bernie, something they wouldn’t do for  and others. they are doing it to bernie again, 2016.
"
6732,2020-02-01,<realDonaldTrump>," mini mike is part of the fake news. they are all working together. in fact, bloomberg isn’t covering himself (too boring to do), or other dems. only trump. that sounds fair! it’s all the fake news media, and that’s why nobody believes in them any more.
"
6733,2020-02-01,<realDonaldTrump>," the radical left, do nothing democrats, don’t want justice when pushing the impeachment hoax, they only want to destabilize the republican party so they can do better in the 2020 election, &amp; that includes the house &amp; senate. they are playing with the people by taking it this far!

"
6741,2020-01-31,<realDonaldTrump>," the radical left, do nothing democrats keep chanting “fairness”, when they put on the most unfair witch hunt in the history of the u.s. congress. they had 17 witnesses, we were allowed zero, and no lawyers. they didn’t do their job, had no case. the dems are scamming america!
"

8025,2020-01-12,<SpeakerPelosi>," at the end of 2019, i led a bipartisan congressional delegation to mark the 75th anniversary of the battle of the bulge. the message from our veterans was clear: pray for peace.   "
8026,2020-01-12,<SpeakerPelosi>, the president has been impeached – and no amount of gamesmanship from leader mcconnell will erase that fact. #defendourdemocracy   
8027,2020-01-12,<SpeakerPelosi>, history – and the american public – are clear: the senate should hear from witnesses who have direct knowledge of the president’s abuses of power. #defendourdemocracy   
8028,2020-01-10,<SpeakerPelosi>," so-called “forever chemicals” are threatening the health and well-being of thousands of american communities. thank you,  for helping lead the fight to clean up contaminated sites nationwide.  "
8029,2020-01-10,<SpeakerPelosi>," by joining a resolution to dismiss, sen. mcconnell showed his true colors. americans have now seen what is at stake in a fair trial with witnesses &amp; evidence, and new evidence has emerged. every senator will have to vote: is their loyalty is to the president or the constitution?
"
8030,2020-01-09,<SpeakerPelosi>, read my full statement on the trump administration’s announcement that it will revise implementation guidelines for the national environment policy act here:  
8031,2020-01-09,<SpeakerPelosi>," american communities are already feeling the effects of the #climatecrisis. by revising guidelines for the national environment policy act, the admin is once again ignoring science and putting the needs of special interests &amp; donors ahead of the well-being of american families.
"
8032,2020-01-09,<SpeakerPelosi>," if republican senators move for a quick dismissal of the charges against the president, with no witnesses or documents, it will be because they are afraid of the truth.   dismissal = cover-up  #defendourdemocracy  "
8033,2020-01-09,<SpeakerPelosi>," we must protect americans right to worship &amp; gather free from fear or violence. tune in as i sign h.r. 2476, the securing american nonprofit organizations against terrorism act.  "
8034,2020-01-09,<SpeakerPelosi>," instead of defending the law of the land, the trump justice department is *fighting to tear down* the affordable care act — to erase pre-existing condition protections, end the ban on lifetime limits of coverage, and destroy all its other protections. #protectourcare
"
8035,2020-01-09,<SpeakerPelosi>, tune in as i speak with reporters as the house prepares to vote on a war power resolution limiting president trump’s military actions regarding iran.  
8036,2020-01-09,<SpeakerPelosi>, my weekly press conference will be at 10:45 am et.  tune in here to watch:  
8037,2020-01-08,<SpeakerPelosi>," the house is moving forward with  war powers resolution limiting the president’s military actions regarding iran. the admin must work with the congress to advance an immediate, effective de-escalatory strategy which prevents further violence.  "
8038,2020-01-08,<SpeakerPelosi>," congratulations,  on your swearing-in today. i look forward to working with you to continue san francisco’s proud tradition of standing as a guiding light for progress across america.  "
8039,2020-01-08,<SpeakerPelosi>," every year, i am brought back to this moment.  you have been a model of strength and persistence for the last nine years. even as our hearts ache for those impacted by gun violence, every day of your fight to end gun violence gives us hope for the future.
"
8040,2020-01-08,<SpeakerPelosi>," make no mistake:  this commonsense, bipartisan legislation will save lives – if only leader mcconnell would bring it up for a vote in the senate.  enough is enough. it’s time for the  to do the right thing and work with us to #endgunviolence.
"
8041,2020-01-08,<SpeakerPelosi>," communities all across america have experienced the tragic reality of gun violence – yet for too long, their pain was met with silence from congress. that ended 365 days ago, as  introduced h.r. 8, the bipartisan background checks act.  "
8042,2020-01-08,<SpeakerPelosi>, it is a pleasure to welcome prime minister  of greece to the u.s. capitol to discuss the strong partnership between our two countries.  
8043,2020-01-07,<SpeakerPelosi>," closely monitoring the situation following bombings targeting u.s. troops in iraq. we must ensure the safety of our servicemembers, including ending needless provocations from the administration and demanding that iran cease its violence. america &amp; world cannot afford war.
"
8044,2020-01-07,<SpeakerPelosi>," as a californian, i have seen firsthand the devastating impact caused by earthquakes. the trump admin must quickly respond to the recent earthquakes in puerto rico with the urgency &amp; compassion our fellow americans there deserve.  "
8045,2020-01-06,<SpeakerPelosi>," the president &amp; sen. mcconnell have run out of excuses. they must allow key witnesses to testify, and produce the documents trump has blocked, so americans can see the facts for themselves.  the senate cannot be complicit in the president's cover-up. #defendourdemocracy
"
8046,2020-01-05,<SpeakerPelosi>," the thoughts of all americans are with the families of the us servicemember &amp; contractors killed &amp; with wounded defense dept. personnel in manda bay, kenya. together with our allies, we must strengthen our commitment to defeating al-shabaab &amp; the forces of terror in the world.
"
8047,2020-01-04,<SpeakerPelosi>," president trump’s classified war powers act notification raises more questions than it answers about the timing, manner and justification of the decision to engage in hostilities against iran.  "
8048,2020-01-03,<SpeakerPelosi>," every day that republicans’ anti-health care lawsuit is allowed to endure is a day that american families will be forced to live in uncertainty &amp; fear. unless the ussc acts, families will continue to face needless disruption in their coverage &amp; premiums.  "
8049,2020-01-03,<SpeakerPelosi>," today,  mcconnell made clear that he will feebly comply with president trump’s cover-up of his abuses of power and be an accomplice to that cover-up. the american people deserve the truth. #defendourdemocracy  "
8050,2020-01-03,<SpeakerPelosi>," the trump admin has conducted strikes in iraq targeting high-level iranian military officials and killing iranian quds force commander qasem soleimani without an aumf against iran. further, this action was taken without the consultation of the congress.
"
8051,2020-01-03,<SpeakerPelosi>," american leaders’ highest priority is to protect american lives and interests. but we cannot put the lives of american servicemembers, diplomats and others further at risk by engaging in provocative and disproportionate actions.  "
8052,2020-01-02,<SpeakerPelosi>, enough is enough.  passed the bipartisan #lowerdrugcosts now act last year to stop big pharma from charging americans more for our medicines than what they charge for the same drugs overseas. the gop senate should join us &amp; pass #hr3 now!  
8053,2020-01-02,<SpeakerPelosi>," trump engaged in unprecedented, total obstruction of congress, hiding these emails, all other documents, and his top aides from the american people.  his excuse was a phony complaint about the house process.  what’s the excuse now? why won’t trump &amp; mcconnell allow a fair trial?
"
8054,2020-01-01,<SpeakerPelosi>," 157 years ago, president lincoln’s emancipation proclamation took effect, starting the process of freeing slaves across america which would end 36 months later, with the abolition of slavery in texas.
"
8055,2020-01-01,<SpeakerPelosi>," for six years, americans of every age have been protected against health insurance discrimination if they have pre-existing conditions.  now, trump and republicans are trying to tear away those protections. #protectourcare
"
8056,2020-11-12,<senatemajldr>," it is sad to see leading democrats including some governors treat the vaccine news like a mixed blessing because it occurred under a republican administration. some things must be bigger than politics.  leaders should be cheering this on, not baselessly undermining science.
"
8057,2020-11-12,<senatemajldr>," this week’s news on a covid-19 vaccine was incredibly promising. all of us have to keep up commonsense precautions in the meantime. the virus is spreading quickly in kentucky and nationwide, and it doesn’t care whether we’ve gotten bored with wearing masks or social distancing.
"
8058,2020-11-11,<senatemajldr>," today, we reflect on the heroism of america’s veterans and those currently serving in uniform.  from the greatest generation to our 21st-century fighting force, we owe all veterans our gratitude and respect.   happy veterans day.  "
8059,2020-11-10,<senatemajldr>," this news confirms what republicans have said for months:  our country needs more smart, focused relief that is targeted to schools, healthcare, small businesses, &amp; those who are hurting the most.  not the absurd multi-trillion-dollar socialist wish-lists democrats have demanded.
"
8060,2020-11-10,<senatemajldr>," american workers are rebuilding our economy stronger &amp; faster than anyone predicted.   experts predicted double-digit unemployment into 2021. instead, it’s down to 6.9%. more than 630k new jobs just last month.   too many are still hurting. our work isn't done. but what progress.
"
8061,2020-11-10,<senatemajldr>, grateful to my senate republican colleagues for their unanimous confidence in me to continue serving as leader. we have a lot more to do to continue fighting for working families and strengthening our great country.  
8062,2020-11-10,<senatemajldr>," yesterday, we learned one covid-19 vaccine candidate may be more than 90% effective.   this huge good news is a testament to the ingenuity of the american private sector and the historic groundwork laid by congress and the trump administration.  "
8063,2020-11-06,<senatemajldr>," here’s how this must work in our great country: every legal vote should be counted. any illegally-submitted ballots must not. all sides must get to observe the process. and the courts are here to apply the laws &amp; resolve disputes.  that's how americans' votes decide the result.
"
8064,2020-10-30,<senatemajldr>, icymi: i joined  to discuss confirming justice barrett to the supreme court and democrats’ threats against our governing  institutions:  
8065,2020-10-29,<senatemajldr>, tune in now: i am joining  to discuss the senate’s successful confirmation of justice barrett to the supreme court.  
8066,2020-10-27,<senatemajldr>," icymi: i joined  to discuss confirming justice barrett to the supreme court, democrats’ continued threats to pack the courts, and speaker pelosi continuing to block covid-19 relief.  "
8067,2020-10-26,<senatemajldr>," tune in now: i’m joining  on  to discuss the confirmation of justice amy coney barrett to the supreme court of the united states.
"
8068,2020-10-26,<senatemajldr>, the senate just confirmed judge amy coney barrett to the supreme court of the united states.  one of the most impressive nominees for public office in a generation will serve for life on our highest court.  
8069,2020-10-25,<senatemajldr>," the senate just voted to advance one of the most qualified nominees in generations. judge barrett’s intellectual brilliance, integrity, and commitment to impartiality are above reproach.   tomorrow, we will vote to confirm the next associate justice of the supreme court.
"
8070,2020-10-24,<senatemajldr>, more coronavirus resources are on the way to kentucky. with the help of  &amp;  kentucky students &amp; teachers will receive more than two million masks.   one of the most important things we can do to protect ourselves &amp; others is to wear a mask.  
8071,2020-10-24,<senatemajldr>, democrats cannot use “illegitimate” as a synonym for “we didn’t get our way.”  democrats keep demanding the president repeat that the election will be valid even if he dislikes the outcome. but they're flunking that test badly with judge barrett's nomination.  
8072,2020-10-24,<senatemajldr>," for the third time this year, the trump administration’s efforts have guided an historic step forward in the middle east. yesterday’s announcement of normalized relations between israel and sudan is good news for peace-loving people everywhere.
"
8073,2020-10-22,<senatemajldr>," with no good arguments to stop judge barrett, democrats have resorted to blatant falsehoods. inventing fake lincoln quotes. lying about this moving faster than many past confirmations.  facts, not falsehoods, are going to carry the day in the senate.  "
8074,2020-10-22,<senatemajldr>," tune in now: i’m joining  on  to discuss judge amy coney barrett’s nomination to the supreme court and democrats’ continued blockade of covid-19 relief for struggling americans.
"
8075,2020-10-22,<senatemajldr>," this morning, the judiciary committee reported judge barrett’s nomination to the senate floor. their unanimous recommendation was that she be confirmed.   this nomination will receive an up-or-down vote on the senate floor in the next several days.
"
8076,2020-10-21,<senatemajldr>, our constitution forbids disqualifying people from public service due to their religious beliefs. the far left has either forgotten this or just doesn’t care. it only underscores why we need well-informed jurists like judge barrett to protect our constitution &amp; americans’ rights.  
8077,2020-10-21,<senatemajldr>," senate democrats just used the filibuster — which they say they dislike — to kill another coronavirus relief package.   unemployment benefits. ppp. testing. vaccines. school funding. protections for people with pre-existing conditions.   every democrat just voted to block it all.
"
8078,2020-10-21,<senatemajldr>," now: the senate is voting on another rescue package for american families.  testing. treatments. vaccines. unemployment aid. another ppp. historic money for schools. find common ground &amp; get help out the door.  we'll see if democrats use the filibuster to kill the bill.
"
8079,2020-10-21,<senatemajldr>," democrats have said we shouldn’t pass any more relief at all unless speaker pelosi gets her whole far-left wish list, including all kinds of non-covid-related demands.   working families in kentucky and around the country deserve better than this obstruction.
"
8080,2020-10-20,<senatemajldr>," the paycheck protection program has made a critical difference for millions of working families. today, i’m having the senate vote on a new second round for the hardest-hit small businesses.   democrats say they support the ppp. let’s see how they vote.
"
8081,2020-10-20,<senatemajldr>," democrats have delayed aid for months over non-covid-related liberal demands. last night, leader schumer even tried to adjourn the senate for three weeks. americans need help; democrats just want to go home.   we are voting on more aid this week.
"
8082,2020-10-19,<senatemajldr>," speaker pelosi’s all-or-nothing act has kept americans waiting for months. we badly need congress to agree where we can, get money out the door now, and keep arguing over the speaker’s non-covid-related wish list later.  we'll vote on hundreds of billions in more aid this week.
"
8083,2020-10-19,<senatemajldr>," last week, judge barrett proved she has the deep legal expertise, judicial temperament, and intellectual horsepower that americans deserve to have on the supreme court. the senate will turn to her nomination as soon as it comes out of committee later this week.
"
8084,2020-10-17,<senatemajldr>, i just announced the senate will vote next week on hundreds of billions more dollars for relief programs that democrats do not even oppose. working families have already waited too long for speaker pelosi’s marie antoinette act to stop. let's make law.  
8085,2020-10-16,<senatemajldr>," judge barrett exhibited every bit of the intellectual brilliance, legal expertise, and open-minded judicial temperament that we need on the supreme court. i will proudly vote to confirm her. the senate will take up her nomination as soon as it comes out of committee.  "
8086,2020-10-14,<senatemajldr>, it is bizarre to watch vice president biden and democrats refuse to give a straight answer on their own party’s threats to pack the supreme court. but it is even more absurd for them to try to redefine “court-packing” to mean any judicial confirmation that disappoints democrats.  
8087,2020-10-13,<senatemajldr>," we don’t agree with speaker pelosi that “nothing” is better than “something” for workers.  senators will vote on more relief next week, including more ppp money to stop layoffs. we’ll be able to pass it before we turn to judge barrett's nomination unless democrats block it again.  "
8088,2020-10-13,<senatemajldr>," judge barrett is just as brilliant and impressive as advertised. she is clearly qualified. she’s committed to fairness and impartiality. and she clearly understands the job of a judge under the constitution is to apply the law and not impose personal policy views.
"
8089,2020-10-11,<senatemajldr>," the far left has been threatening our basic institutions of government since long before this supreme court vacancy. when today’s democrats lose one election or one vote on the senate floor, they start threatening to tear up the rulebook.  "
8090,2020-10-09,<senatemajldr>, judge barrett is a stellar nominee. i think the president picked the single best person he could have picked anywhere in the country. this is a woman of extraordinary achievement.  
8091,2020-10-07,<senatemajldr>," icymi: i joined  to discuss the senate’s months of success with hybrid hearings, judge barrett’s outstanding qualifications, and democrats’ refusal to get serious on covid-19 relief talks.  "
8092,2020-10-07,<senatemajldr>," the ongoing attacks by senate democrats and the media on judge barrett’s faith are a disgrace. they demean the confirmation process, disrespect the constitution, and insult millions of american believers.  "
8093,2020-10-06,<senatemajldr>, president trump made an outstanding choice in judge amy coney barrett. she is one of the finest legal minds of her generation. she’s won national admiration for her example of strong female leadership. she’s exactly the kind of person americans deserve on their highest court.  
8094,2020-10-05,<senatemajldr>," judge barrett’s hearings will begin one week from today. chairman graham has all the tools to conduct a hybrid hearing, just like the 150 others the senate has held this year.   we will not stop working for the american people because democrats are afraid they may lose a vote.
"
8095,2020-10-05,<senatemajldr>," democrats say they’ll try everything to stall judge barrett. the latest excuse: hybrid hearings with some virtual participation are suddenly bad.   the senate has held 150 of these hybrid hearings since may. democrats have taken advantage of the tools. they’ve praised the format.
"
8096,2020-10-03,<senatemajldr>," just had another great call with  he sounds well and says he’s feeling good. we talked about the people’s business — fighting the pandemic, confirming judge barrett, and strengthening the economy for american families. let’s keep our president &amp; first lady in our prayers.
"
8097,2020-10-03,<senatemajldr>, senate floor proceedings will be postponed until october 19th. the  confirmation hearings for judge barrett’s nomination to the supreme court will convene on october 12th as scheduled by chairman graham. my full statement:  
8098,2020-10-02,<senatemajldr>," icymi: i joined  this morning to discuss judge barrett’s outstanding qualifications, the decision by some on the left to attack her religious faith, and the democrats’ ongoing threats against our governing institutions.  "
8099,2020-10-02,<senatemajldr>," just finished a great phone call with  he’s in good spirits and we talked business — especially how impressed senators are with the qualifications of judge barrett. full steam ahead with the fair, thorough, timely process that the nominee, the court, &amp; the country deserve.
"
8100,2020-10-02,<senatemajldr>," happy to hear the white house physician’s report that  and  are feeling well following their positive tests for covid-19. let’s continue to pray today and every day for our president and our first lady and for all those impacted by covid-19.
"
8101,2020-10-01,<senatemajldr>," tune in now to  i’ll be discussing judge barrett’s nomination to the supreme court and the democrats’ ongoing obstruction of more bipartisan covid-19 relief.
"
8102,2020-09-30,<senatemajldr>," everyone who knows judge barrett, across the political spectrum, praises her independence and impartiality.  a judge's job is to follow the facts and the law wherever they lead. nothing more, nothing less.  it's revealing how much this basic concept seems to scare the far left.
"
8103,2020-09-30,<senatemajldr>," democrats want to pack the supreme court. vice president biden refused to rule it out last night. now senate democrats are demanding promises and pre-commitments from judge barrett.   judicial independence is vital to the rule of law. why are republicans alone in defending it?
"
8104,2020-09-30,<senatemajldr>," judge barrett is an exemplary judge and a qualified nominee for the supreme court. her legal peers across the political spectrum praise her independence, fair-mindedness, and impartiality. that is exactly what the american people deserve on their highest court.  "
8105,2020-09-29,<senatemajldr>," multiple times, with multiple nominees, senate democrats have said or implied that certain personal religious beliefs make americans unfit to serve. judge barrett in 2017 was only one example. now the media’s joining in.  these tactics need to stop now.  "
8106,2020-09-29,<senatemajldr>, i had the opportunity to meet with judge barrett earlier today. president trump has nominated exactly the kind of outstanding person whom the american people deserve to have on their highest court.  
8107,2020-09-26,<senatemajldr>, judge amy coney barrett is an exceptionally impressive jurist and an exceedingly well-qualified nominee to the supreme court.   a brilliant scholar. an exemplary judge. president trump could not have made a better decision.  
8108,2020-09-24,<senatemajldr>," tune in: i’m about to join   for my first interview on the supreme court vacancy. the senate will do what we did in 2016: follow history, follow precedent, and do the job we were elected to do.
"
8109,2020-09-24,<senatemajldr>," the far left called john paul stevens anti-woman. they said anthony kennedy would turn back the clock. david souter was going to hurt “women, minorities, dissenters, &amp; other groups"" from the bench.   anyone doubt the same old smears will be rearing their heads starting saturday?
"
8110,2020-09-24,<senatemajldr>," we don’t know which legal all-star the president will nominate on saturday. so isn't it curious that everyone already knows exactly what smears and scare tactics the far left will trot out?   their playbook has not changed for 45 years. the nominee is irrelevant to their attacks.
"
8111,2020-09-24,<senatemajldr>," my full statement on breonna taylor, yesterday’s announcement, and the violence overnight in my hometown of louisville:  "
8112,2020-09-24,<senatemajldr>," the winner of the november 3rd election will be inaugurated on january 20th. there will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792.
"
8113,2020-09-23,<senatemajldr>," house democrats’ first government funding bill intentionally left rural america behind. but  and other republicans did not let the democrats defund farm country. they secured the commodity credit corporation funding that our farmers and ranchers depend on.
"
8114,2020-09-23,<senatemajldr>," yesterday, sen. schumer decided to vent his frustration by blocking a bipartisan intelligence committee meeting on counterintelligence with a leading expert on protecting our elections.  a partisan temper tantrum is one thing. jeopardizing national security is a different story.
"
8115,2020-09-22,<senatemajldr>," rewarding democrats’ tactics now would not stop their attacks on our institutions. their threats predate this new vacancy by over a year.   their recklessness only underscores the importance that we do our job and confirm a nominee who truly respects the constitution.
"
8116,2020-09-22,<senatemajldr>," democrats are threatening to attack the foundations of the senate and the court if they do not get their way.   here's the problem with this attempted blackmail: they have already been making these threats for many months. they've been campaigning on them for over a year.
"
8117,2020-09-22,<senatemajldr>," our senate majority will do exactly the same thing in 2020 that we did in 2016: follow senate history, follow the clear precedent in each situation, and do exactly the job we were elected to do.   we are going to vote on president trump's nominee to the supreme court this year.
"
8118,2020-09-21,<senatemajldr>," justice ruth bader ginsburg was a generational legal giant and a trailblazing champion for american women. the senate is grieving with the nation, praying for her family, and remembering her historic legacy.  my full senate floor remarks:  "
8119,2020-09-21,<senatemajldr>," house democrats’ rough draft of a government funding bill shamefully leaves out key relief and support that american farmers need. this is no time to add insult to injury and defund help for farmers and rural america.
"
8120,2020-09-18,<senatemajldr>, the senate and the nation mourn the passing of justice ruth bader ginsburg and the conclusion of her extraordinary american life.  my full statement:  
8121,2020-09-18,<senatemajldr>," today we honor national pow/mia recognition day. more than 1300 patriotic kentuckians still haven’t come home. they are not forgotten, and we are still searching.
"
8122,2020-09-18,<senatemajldr>," icymi: i joined the  discuss speaker pelosi holding up relief for americans, senate democrats’ filibuster hypocrisy, and democrats playing politics with election security.  "
8123,2020-09-17,<senatemajldr>," in 2019, under republican policies:  - fastest annual growth in household income on record - working-class &amp; middle-class families saw more of the gains - poverty lowest since 1950s   that's the leadership our nation will need as we rebuild after covid.  "
8124,2020-09-16,<senatemajldr>, it’s been less than a year since my bill with senator kaine and  raised the nationwide age for tobacco purchases to 21. we just learned there’s already been a major decline in e-cigarette use among young people. huge bipartisan progress for the health of our kids.  
8125,2020-09-16,<senatemajldr>," even speaker pelosi’s own house democrats are sick of her blocking covid-19 relief.  but she insists anything short of her multi-trillion wish list would make democrats “a cheap date.” what a joke.  people are hurting. they need help. not the speaker's pointless political games.
"
8126,2020-09-15,<senatemajldr>," today is an historic day for middle east peace. landmark agreements formalized at the white house between israel and the uae and bahrain. thanks to the u.s. and the trump administration, the winds of change are blowing across toward progress and peace.
"
8127,2020-09-14,<senatemajldr>," the framers designed the senate to be the country’s firewall against bad ideas and radical change. if democrats are afraid their bad ideas could never meet the bar, it’s their proposals that need to be scrapped, not our country’s checks and balances.
"
8128,2020-09-14,<senatemajldr>, great news: experts have found a huge decline in teen vaping. this is just what we sought with my landmark legislation to increase the required age for all tobacco products to 21. health officials say that law made a big difference.  
8129,2020-09-14,<senatemajldr>, the trump administration has helped secured two historic peace agreements between israel and arab nations in just the last few days. the winds of change are blowing and the middle east is changing for the better. my full statement:  
8130,2020-09-14,<senatemajldr>," senate democrats are threatening to blow up the filibuster if they gain power and ram far-left policies through the senate. but they just used the filibuster last week to block covid relief. they used it this summer to kill  police reform bill.  total hypocrisy.
"
8131,2020-09-14,<senatemajldr>," all military families serve alongside their loved ones in uniform. the new gold star families memorial in owensboro, ky commemorates the sacrifices these patriots made in the name of freedom. the nation can never repay our debt. but we can keep these families in our prayers.  "
8132,2020-09-12,<senatemajldr>," washington democrats have now blocked two separate proposals to provide hundreds of billions of dollars for safe schools, jobs, and healthcare. they just do not want american families getting more help before the election. pure cynicism.
"
8133,2020-09-11,<senatemajldr>," nineteen years ago, thousands of americans were murdered by terrorists. national landmarks burned. brave first responders put their lives on the line to save strangers.   may we never fail to honor them. and may we never tire of our pledge: never again.  "
8134,2020-09-10,<senatemajldr>, icymi i joined  to discuss speaker pelosi &amp; leader schumer's continued efforts to block coronavirus relief funding for americans.    every senator who voted against relief needs to answer what in the proposal they actually disagreed with. kids? jobs? healthcare?  
8135,2020-09-10,<senatemajldr>," every senate democrat just voted against hundreds of billions of dollars of covid-19 relief. they blocked money for schools, testing, vaccines, unemployment insurance, and the paycheck protection program.  their goal is clear: no help for american families before the election.
"
8136,2020-09-10,<senatemajldr>," yesterday, reporters asked sen. schumer whether by refusing to compromise, he was making the perfect the enemy of the good. his response? “republicans are the enemy of the good.”  americans are not enemies. covid-19 is our enemy. it's time for washington democrats to act like it.
"
8137,2020-09-10,<senatemajldr>," the senate is voting today on covid-19 relief. hundreds of billions more dollars to make schools safe for kids, to keep workers getting paid, and to invest in treatments and vaccines.  american families will see exactly which senators want to send them more bipartisan help.
"
8138,2020-09-09,<senatemajldr>," speaker pelosi &amp; leader schumer were attacking our new covid proposal before they’d even read it.  they’re attacking it over provisions that literally have democrat cosponsors.  they just don't want americans getting another cent of bipartisan relief before the november election.
"
8139,2020-09-09,<senatemajldr>, the coronavirus doesn't care about our election. but it's clear that's all democrats care about. look at the facts and ask each democrat what in the proposal that we're voting on tomorrow they actually disagree with.   more historic funding for schools? jobs? healthcare?  
8140,2020-09-09,<senatemajldr>," this year’s kentucky derby showed our great traditions can adapt to overcome any challenge. but our sport must be protected.   i’ve been proud to stand up for horseracing throughout my career. today, i’m introducing new legislation to keep up that support.  "
8141,2020-09-09,<senatemajldr>," republicans will not let speaker pelosi and leader schumer kill covid relief behind closed doors without putting every senator on the record.  tomorrow, we'll vote to protect workers' paychecks, keep kids safe in school, and win the healthcare fight against the virus.
"
8142,2020-09-08,<senatemajldr>," republicans have built yet another effort to help americans. money for schools. resources for parents. testing. vaccines. another round of the job-saving ppp. and more.  the senate will be voting this week. the nation will see who's serious about making law for american families.
"
8143,2020-09-08,<senatemajldr>," democrats have blocked any new covid relief, saying anything short of their entire far-left wish list is “piecemeal” and “emaciated.”   the same democrats rushed back to d.c. to pass piecemeal legislation for the postal service that did nothing at all for working families.
"
8144,2020-09-08,<senatemajldr>," republicans have spent months fighting for more covid-19 relief. we proposed a major $1t bill. speaker pelosi &amp; leader schumer said no. we suggested smaller bipartisan deals. they said no again.   today we put forward yet another proposal. they attacked it before even reading it.
"
8145,2020-09-08,<senatemajldr>," republicans and democrats have big differences, but they should not stop us from agreeing where we can and making law to help americans through this crisis. working families cannot suffer more because democrats think their pain helps them politically. the senate is going to vote.  "
8146,2020-09-08,<senatemajldr>," but republicans are not done fighting for the american people. today our majority is introducing a targeted proposal for kids, jobs, and healthcare to help with many of our most urgent challenges. no more obstruction behind closed doors. every senator will be going on the record.  "
8147,2020-09-08,<senatemajldr>, senate republicans have been trying for months to deliver more covid-19 relief to american families. speaker pelosi and leader schumer have blocked us at every turn. every action has suggested they simply do not want families to get any more bipartisan help before the election.  
8148,2020-09-05,<senatemajldr>," as kentuckians, thoroughbred racing is practically in our bones. it’s who we are. we find our state’s unique history on the track &amp; in the stables. this year's 146th kentucky derby is going to look a little different, but the sun will keep shining bright on my old kentucky home.  "
8149,2020-09-04,<senatemajldr>, my old kentucky home is our state song. i applaud churchill downs for keeping our tradition alive. “cancel culture” cannot be allowed to destroy our history without so much as a real discussion.  
8150,2020-09-03,<senatemajldr>," i’m the only one of the four congressional leaders not from new york or california. it’s my job to look out for middle america, especially my favorite state: kentucky.  "
8151,2020-09-01,<senatemajldr>, the most important things each of us can do to help prevent the spread of covid-19 are to wear a mask and practice social distancing.  
8152,2020-09-01,<senatemajldr>," i’m proud to be joined by prominent horseracing leaders in kentucky as they take the courageous step to protect jobs and increase safety standards for horses, jockeys, trainers, breeders, and fans. i’m grateful to  his strong leadership.  "
8153,2020-08-26,<senatemajldr>," to my democratic colleagues: the coronavirus doesn't have a stake in this election. struggling families across america need our help, and republicans stand ready to deliver.  "
8154,2020-08-25,<senatemajldr>," from mammoth cave in ky to the 400+ parks nationwide, i wish the  a happy birthday. thanks to the great american outdoors act, the nps will stand the test of time for generations. i encourage everyone to get outside, socially distance, and explore these treasures.  "
8155,2020-08-24,<senatemajldr>," the coronavirus does not care about the election. struggling americans need our help now, and that can only happen if washington democrats stop playing games and actually help the american people.  "
8156,2020-08-24,<senatemajldr>," from homegrown hemp masks to distilleries making hand sanitizer, kentuckians are leading by example. we’re going to keep working together to beat this virus.  "
8157,2020-08-22,<senatemajldr>," republicans are committed to making sure the postal service remains well equipped to fulfill its important duties. but the senate will not pass stand-alone legislation for the postal service while american families continue to go without the help they need.
"
8158,2020-08-22,<senatemajldr>," if washington democrats would devote half the energy they spend worrying about their own re-elections to actually helping the american people, we could easily achieve the kind of targeted, bipartisan relief package that republicans have wanted for weeks.
"
8159,2020-08-22,<senatemajldr>," house democrats have spent weeks ignoring the urgent needs of american workers and families, but they rushed back to washington the instant that overblown conspiracy theories about the u.s. postal service convinced them their own jobs might be in jeopardy. my full statement:  "
8160,2020-08-18,<senatemajldr>," russia, china, iran, and others want to undermine americans’ confidence in our institutions. i applaud the intelligence committee’s in-depth investigation and the steps congress, this administration, and the intelligence community have taken to defend us.  "
8161,2020-08-17,<senatemajldr>," delivering for kentucky is my highest priority in the senate. with the support i secured, renovations to the rochester dam will make sure the drinking water is safe and abundant.  "
8162,2020-08-13,<senatemajldr>," no family in middle america is saying: ""thank goodness the democrats are blocking cash payments to me, money for my kids’ schools, and money for vaccines until manhattan millionaires get a tax cut!""  what american families everywhere want is an outcome.  "
8163,2020-08-13,<senatemajldr>," democrats’ latest spin: they’ve moved from a $3.5 trillion, far-left, non-covid-related wish list to a $2.5 trillion, far-left, non-covid-related wish list and insist the white house meet them there.  that’s not a reality-based negotiation. it’s throwing spaghetti at the wall.  "
8164,2020-08-13,<senatemajldr>, president trump deserves great credit for bringing about this historic step forward for the middle east. the commitment to normalize relations between israel and the united arab emirates represents tremendous progress toward greater peace and prosperity across the region.  
8165,2020-08-12,<senatemajldr>," the ppp saved main street jobs across kentucky. it sent more than $5b in payroll support to our state. but the recovery is not finished. hard-hit businesses need a second draw, and republicans proposed one.  but democrats are blocking it over non-covid-related wish-list items.
"
8166,2020-08-11,<senatemajldr>," americans need relief, and that means focusing on what’s directly related to covid-19: kids, jobs, healthcare, and legal protections for re-opening.  i applaud the president for taking action during this emergency to get help to americans who are struggling.  "
8167,2020-08-11,<senatemajldr>," the speaker &amp; democratic leader say not another dime for testing, treatments, or vaccines unless they get a huge tax cut for blue-state millionaires.   taking our health system hostage over longtime, non-covid-related, liberal demands.   this is a crisis. let's govern like it.
"
8168,2020-08-11,<senatemajldr>," tune in now to  i’m joining  to discuss democrats’ decision to play hardball with vulnerable americans who need help and hurt our nation’s chance to get on offense against the virus.
"
8169,2020-08-11,<senatemajldr>," the speaker and the democratic leader say they won’t allow another cent for families, schools, or the ppp unless they get a trillion-dollar state government slush fund, way beyond covid needs.   these unrelated liberal demands are blocking billions in aid that families need now.
"
8170,2020-08-11,<senatemajldr>," the new york times proclaims democrats are “playing hardball on coronavirus relief.”   “playing” is right — they’re treating this like a political game.   families are suffering. americans are dying. this isn’t a game, it’s a crisis. our country needs democrats to act like it.
"
8171,2020-08-10,<senatemajldr>," because of democrats’ obstruction, the extra federal unemployment aid expired. the ppp is closed with no second round in sight. no new money for testing or schools. no second round of checks to families. democrats held all this hostage for non-covid-related liberal priorities.
"
8172,2020-08-10,<senatemajldr>," i hoped this week we’d be finalizing major legislation. after all, american families are struggling and need help. but speaker pelosi and leader schumer decided not to deliver. i am glad the president stepped in to soften the blow of their hostage tactics.
"
8173,2020-08-08,<senatemajldr>," struggling americans need action now. i am glad that president trump is proving that while democrats use laid-off workers as political pawns, republicans will actually look out for them. my full statement:  "
8174,2020-08-07,<senatemajldr>, i appreciate director evanina’s report on foreign powers’ efforts to divide us and interfere in our politics. i am confident american voters will reject the fear-mongering that seeks to undermine confidence in our elections. my full statement:  
8175,2020-08-06,<senatemajldr>," some predicted weeks ago that democratic leaders did not actually want another bipartisan rescue package to pass, and would sabotage negotiations by refusing to come an inch toward the white house in these talks. have americans seen anything at all to disprove that?
"
8176,2020-08-06,<senatemajldr>," icymi, i joined  to discuss democrats’ obstruction of the covid-19 relief negotiations, how republicans tried to keep extra unemployment benefits from expiring, and the need to keep small-business aid flowing.  "
8177,2020-08-06,<senatemajldr>," democrats’ obstruction last week forced the additional federal unemployment benefit to expire. their obstruction this week will force another deadline: the ppp shuts its doors saturday. republicans had plans to keep both from expiring. democrats have refused them all.
"
8178,2020-08-06,<senatemajldr>," tune in now to  i am joining  to discuss senate republicans’ plan to help struggling americans who are facing the mounting consequences of democrats' inaction. our nation needs a bipartisan outcome, and they need it now.
"
8179,2020-08-05,<senatemajldr>," tune in now to  special report. i am joining  to discuss senate republicans’ plan to help working families, small businesses, and healthcare heroes navigate this new phase of the pandemic.
"
8180,2020-08-05,<senatemajldr>, our country is facing bigger problems than whether malibu gets to upgrade its street-sweepers. struggling families need help now. democratic leaders must stop blocking aid to americans over their unrelated left-wing wish list.  
8181,2020-08-05,<senatemajldr>, i extend the senate’s condolences to the people of lebanon following yesterday’s horrific explosion in beirut. my full statement:  
8182,2020-08-05,<senatemajldr>," democratic leaders say they’ll keep blocking federal unemployment aid unless we pay people more to stay home than to work. that isn’t just bad economics, it’s unfair. we should not be taxing essential workers to pay their neighbors a higher salary to stay home.  "
8183,2020-08-04,<senatemajldr>," we need to urgently help working families and those who’ve lost their jobs. but the speaker and the democratic leader are blocking the entire rescue package over a special, unrelated tax cut for rich people in high-tax blue states.
"
8184,2020-08-04,<senatemajldr>," speaker pelosi is still holding up this entire package over bizarre unrelated things like carveouts for the marijuana industry. she even claimed to the press that pot is a proven covid-19 therapy!   i hope she’s shared this breakthrough with dr. fauci.   can we get serious yet?
"
8185,2020-08-04,<senatemajldr>, president trump just signed the great american outdoors act into law. the gaoa will protect our country's natural treasures and promote recreation and conservation for generations — thanks to the strong leadership of  and   
8186,2020-08-04,<senatemajldr>," senate republicans proposed a major rescue package: a trillion dollars for kids, jobs, and healthcare. but democrats are blocking it all. the american people need a bipartisan outcome, not democrats’ stonewalling behind closed doors.
"
8187,2020-08-03,<senatemajldr>, the senate mourns the young american servicemembers who were tragically lost while training last week. our sympathies are with their families and our gratitude is with all the personnel who led the tireless search.  
8188,2020-07-31,<senatemajldr>," republicans tried several ways to extend unemployment benefits. democrats blocked them all. they're refusing any more covid relief for anyone unless they get a massive tax cut for rich people in blue states.  the country can’t afford this cynicism. americans need help now.
"
8189,2020-07-31,<senatemajldr>," icymi: i joined   to continue discussing senate republicans' efforts to help get kids back in school, put workers back on the clock, and equip our healthcare heroes to finish the fight.  "
8190,2020-07-30,<senatemajldr>," democrats are holding up urgent help for struggling people over completely unrelated liberal wish-list items, like massive tax cuts for rich people in blue states. economists across the spectrum say it’s a terrible idea. this is how serious they are about these negotiations.
"
8191,2020-07-30,<senatemajldr>," icymi: i joined  on  to discuss the importance of helping schools and employers safely reopen, and delivering new relief to working families in need. for the country’s sake, democrats need to come to the table.  "
8192,2020-07-30,<senatemajldr>, senate republicans tried several ways to extend the expiring unemployment assistance. democrats blocked them all and refused another dime for covid-19 relief unless they get to pass a bill that includes an unrelated tax cut for rich people in blue states.  
8193,2020-07-30,<senatemajldr>," there’s a fact of life here in the united states senate: it takes 60 votes to legislate. so the american people cannot get any of the additional relief that republicans want to give them unless democrats will come to the table.
"
8194,2020-07-29,<senatemajldr>," the coronavirus does not care that we are divided. the coronavirus will not care if washington democrats decide it suits their partisan goals to let relief run dry.  the american people are hurting and congress should have their backs.
"
8195,2020-07-29,<senatemajldr>," the historic cares act has helped families endure this crisis. but our nation is not done with this fight. more americans are dying. millions are unemployed. added federal unemployment benefits are close to expiring.  democrats need to get serious and come to the table.
"
8196,2020-07-28,<senatemajldr>, i joined  to discuss senate republican's heals act.   the pandemic is not finished. the economic pain is not finished. so congress cannot be finished either. republicans are ready to govern. we just need democrats to decide whether they are serious about making law.  
8197,2020-07-28,<senatemajldr>," tune in now to  i am joining  ~3:05 pm et to discuss senate republicans' heals act — our framework for another round of historic relief to american workers and families.
"
8198,2020-07-28,<senatemajldr>," our democratic colleagues want to pretend it is controversial that taxpayers should not pay people more not to work than the people who do go back to work. the american people don’t call that a controversy. they call that common sense. they call that basic fairness.
"
8199,2020-07-28,<senatemajldr>," our nation stands at a challenging crossroads. we have one foot in this pandemic and one foot in the recovery. what the american people need is a smart, safe, and sustainable middle ground.    they need congress’s help to construct it. that’s exactly what the heals act would do.
"
8200,2020-07-27,<senatemajldr>," republicans have created a serious framework. the question is whether democrats will come to the table in good faith. in march, when they did, we passed the cares act unanimously. in june, when they didn’t, police reform collapsed.  it will take bipartisanship to make law.
"
8201,2020-07-27,<senatemajldr>," we have produced a tailored and targeted bill that will address each of the three distinct crises facing our country: getting kids back in school, getting workers back to work, and winning the healthcare fight against the virus. kids, jobs, and healthcare.
"
8202,2020-07-27,<senatemajldr>," covid-19 has killed nearly 150,000 americans. 17 million people are out of work. the virus is still with us and the american people need more help. that is why senate republicans are introducing a new comprehensive rescue package today:  "
8203,2020-07-26,<senatemajldr>," this terrible virus is still with us and america’s fight continues. across the country, by taking commonsense steps – like wearing a mask and practicing social distancing – we’ll get through this together.  "
8204,2020-07-24,<senatemajldr>," the cares act provided kentucky and our nation with the tools to endure the first phase of the coronavirus crisis. but america’s fight continues, so congress’s support for our people must continue as well. cares 2 will focus on three things: kids, jobs, and healthcare.  "
8205,2020-07-23,<senatemajldr>," the senate majority has assembled a framework for cares 2. it is tailored precisely to this phase of the crisis to deliver more relief to the american people. it represents an agreement in principle with the administration, and will be introduced next week.
"
8206,2020-07-23,<senatemajldr>," our nation stands at a critical midway point in our fight against the coronavirus. far too many families are continuing to face serious healthcare and economic challenges. so congress’ support for our people must continue as well.
"
8207,2020-07-23,<senatemajldr>," the senate just advanced the 60th annual national defense authorization act to keep our armed forces on the cutting edge as they protect america, our allies, and our interest around the world.  "
8208,2020-07-22,<senatemajldr>, the house just passed  and  ‘s great american outdoors act. next stop: the white house to be signed into law.  
8209,2020-07-22,<senatemajldr>," a very happy 97th birthday to my great friend,  millions of people continue to benefit from the causes bob championed in the senate, and the many friends he made here join me in wishing him health and happiness in the year to come.  "
8210,2020-07-22,<senatemajldr>," today, the senate will vote on a democrat amendment to slash defense spending that was advertised in an op-ed titled “defund the pentagon.”  from defunding the police to defunding the u.s. armed forces.  republicans are going to stand firm and defeat this unhinged policy.  "
8211,2020-07-21,<senatemajldr>," the american people cannot completely stop building their lives until a vaccine is available. the u.s.a. was not built for a defensive crouch. we need to smartly, safely stand up an educational system and an economy that works for workers and families in the meantime.  "
8212,2020-07-21,<senatemajldr>," at the outset of this crisis, the senate wrote and passed the historic, bipartisan cares act. it helped pull our health system and economy back from the brink. but this crisis is far from over. the american people still need help. so the senate must act again.
"
8213,2020-07-20,<senatemajldr>," dr. martin luther king, jr. famously said “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” our nation has bent toward justice because heroes like john lewis took it upon themselves to lead the way. we celebrate the life of this american hero.  "
8214,2020-07-20,<senatemajldr>," our country can’t afford a second epidemic of frivolous lawsuits while we fight the covid-19 pandemic. the next relief package should focus on four things: jobs, healthcare, kids in school, and liability protections for those helping us fight the coronavirus.  "
8215,2020-07-18,<senatemajldr>," i will never forget joining hands with john as congress sang we shall overcome at a 2008 ceremony honoring his friend dr. martin luther king, jr. it could not have been more humbling to consider what he had suffered and sacrificed so those words could be sung in that place.
"
8216,2020-07-18,<senatemajldr>," the senate and the nation mourn the loss of congressman john lewis, a pioneering civil rights leader who put his life on the line to fight racism, promote equal rights, and bring our nation into greater alignment with its founding principles.
"
8217,2020-07-17,<senatemajldr>, my statement on the passing of congressman john lewis:  
8218,2020-07-16,<senatemajldr>, the cares act didn't just give main street a fighting chance. the senate’s historic legislation has also given rural healthcare and hospitals the resources they needed to keep their medical staff on the payroll and focus on fighting the coronavirus.  
8219,2020-07-15,<senatemajldr>," the paycheck protection program helped 48,000 kentucky small businesses. from coast to coast, small businesses received emergency help to keep employees on payroll and weather the storm. i’m proud the senate’s policy has saved millions and millions of jobs.  "
8220,2020-07-14,<senatemajldr>," glad our friends and partners are stepping up to check china. freedom-loving nations must stand together for peace, prosperity, and human rights.
"
8221,2020-07-13,<senatemajldr>," any future covid relief package needs to be measured, with a focus on getting kids back in school safely, workers back on the job, and delivering liability protections for individuals related to the coronavirus crisis.  "
8222,2020-07-09,<senatemajldr>, expanding the availability of testing is one of the best ways to slow the spread of the coronavirus. we’ve seen american ingenuity mobilize a full-scale response to this crisis and i’m grateful to the kentuckians and american heroes who continue to step up to this challenge.  
8223,2020-07-08,<senatemajldr>," kentucky’s law enforcement officers know the hidta program unlocks crucial resources for our fight against drug abuse. i‘m proud to have helped deliver these federal resources to clark, logan and simpson counties.  "
8224,2020-07-07,<senatemajldr>," we can’t get our country back to normal unless we have kids in school. that’s what a future covid relief would focus on, along with jobs, healthcare, and liability protections.  "
8225,2020-07-06,<senatemajldr>, the cares act is continuing to provide much-needed support to healthcare heroes in kentucky and across america. i’m proud of the senate’s work to make sure these critical resources are available to help our nation recover.  
8226,2020-07-04,<senatemajldr>, happy fourth of july!   let’s celebrate the high virtues of our nation. let’s honor the leaders who made our country great and the sacrifices of those who defend her. and let’s never forget how incredibly proud we are to be americans.  
8227,2020-07-02,<senatemajldr>, the democratic party is increasingly saying they’ve lost patience with playing by the rules and plan to declare war on the rulebook itself.  i spoke today about the future of our nation’s governing institutions:  
8228,2020-07-02,<senatemajldr>," icymi: i joined  to discuss the senate’s leading role in coronavirus relief and the importance of legal protections for doctors, nurses, schools, universities, and employers.  "
8229,2020-07-01,<senatemajldr>," the speaker has chosen to spend the house’s time this week on a cousin of the green new deal masquerading as a highway bill.   it will go nowhere in the senate. here, we’ll keep at the serious work of the nation.  "
8230,2020-07-01,<senatemajldr>," tune in: i will be joining  ~2:40pm et to discuss senate republicans' accomplishments and our work on coronavirus relief.
"
8231,2020-07-01,<senatemajldr>," finally. twenty-some days and several deaths too late. the rule of law must not fade in and out with the fashions of the radical left.
"
8232,2020-06-30,<senatemajldr>," senate republicans led the cares act, the biggest rescue package in american history that helped our nation weather this storm. any further legislation will need to focus intently on kids, jobs, and healthcare, and include legal protections to help schools and businesses reopen.  "
8233,2020-06-30,<senatemajldr>, more disastrous steps by beijing to tighten their grip on hong kong. congress and the administration have taken strong steps to stand with hong kong. we need to keep it up and friends of democracy around the world should join us.  
8234,2020-06-29,<senatemajldr>," house democrats' last attempt at a coronavirus response was a go-nowhere liberal wish list that even the media laughed off. with 40+ covid hearings by the end of this week, the senate is continuing the serious, facts-first approach that built the historic cares act.
"
8235,2020-06-29,<senatemajldr>," we must have no stigma, none, about wearing masks when we leave our homes and come near other people. wearing simple face coverings is not about protecting ourselves, it is about protecting everyone we encounter.
"
8236,2020-06-27,<senatemajldr>, icymi: i joined the  to discuss senate democrats’ blocking police reform and the senate’s historic judicial confirmations.  
8237,2020-06-26,<senatemajldr>, tune in: i’m joining  at 4:00pm et to discuss senate democrats’ obstruction of police reform and our latest milestone in renewing the judiciary.   
8238,2020-06-24,<senatemajldr>," democrats say they disagree with parts of  bill. fine. the senate has a way to settle policy differences. it’s called legislating. the only reason to duck the whole process is if democrats would rather preserve a campaign issue than find a bipartisan solution.
"
8239,2020-06-24,<senatemajldr>," democrats just blocked the senate from even considering police reform. they threatened to do this unless i let them short-circuit the amendment process and rewrite  bill behind closed doors. this issue deserved better than more do-nothing democratic theatrics.
"
8240,2020-06-24,<senatemajldr>," the senate has confirmed 200 of president trump’s nominees to lifetime appointments on the federal bench. with today's confirmation, not a single circuit court vacancy exists anywhere in the nation for the first time in at least 40 years.  "
8241,2020-06-23,<senatemajldr>, “equal protection of the laws” means that mayors and governors cannot selectively stand down because they fear the political price for confronting a particular mob.  maintaining the peace is these leaders’ duty. it is not an option that depends on the lawbreakers’ politics.  
8242,2020-06-23,<senatemajldr>," if the far left cannot distinguish between confederate generals and washington, jefferson, and grant, they have completely exited the real world.   we are so proud of the imperfect american heroes who built the most perfect union the world has ever seen.  "
8243,2020-06-22,<senatemajldr>," later this week, thanks to  the senate will vote to consider police reform legislation on the floor. i hope both sides come together and vote to begin this important debate. the american people deserve more than political posturing. they deserve an outcome.
"
8244,2020-06-21,<senatemajldr>, thinking of my dad today. happy father’s day to all the dads in kentucky and across our great country.  
8245,2020-06-19,<senatemajldr>," i just spoke in kentucky about juneteenth and america’s continued work to overcome the stain of our original sin. we must keep working to ensure that the timeless principles of our founding continue to triumph over prejudice and injustice.
"
8246,2020-06-18,<senatemajldr>," the senate just confirmed  exceptional choice to sit on the second-most-important federal bench. we kentuckians are sorry to lose judge justin walker, but we're very proud this brilliant and fair jurist will be serving our nation on the d.c. circuit.  "
8247,2020-06-18,<senatemajldr>," the justice act provides solutions on police reform that are sober, serious, and significant. the senate should address this issue now. but we’ll only be able to act if both sides can work together. i hope our democratic colleagues will come to the table next week.
"
8248,2020-06-17,<senatemajldr>," sadly, democrats began attacking the justice act proposal before it was even released.   the senate has recently put division aside to produce major bipartisan bills like the cares act and the great american outdoors act. police reform needs that same spirit. i hope we see it.
"
8249,2020-06-17,<senatemajldr>," . has put together a strong and significant proposal to increase transparency, grow accountability, and advance needed reforms in policing. the senate will turn to the justice act next week. it will take bipartisan cooperation for the senate to make a law.
"
8250,2020-06-17,<senatemajldr>," when black americans tell us they do not feel safe in their own communities, we need to listen. when citizens lack faith in our justice system, we need to respond. and when the equal protection of the law feels to some americans like a contingency of demographics, we need to act.
"
8251,2020-06-16,<senatemajldr>," elaine and i are stunned and heartbroken by carol barr’s passing. her warmth filled whatever room she entered. her contributions made kentucky a better place for all of us. we send our sincere condolences to andy, their girls, and their family at this terribly painful time.
"
8252,2020-06-16,<senatemajldr>," with our country facing a pandemic, an historic economic disruption, and a major discussion of racial justice, speaker pelosi has mostly kept her chamber on the longest-running spring break in human history. over here, in the senate, we are attending to the needs of the nation.  "
8253,2020-06-15,<senatemajldr>," public lands preserve our nation’s beauty, provide recreation for american families, and help their local economies prosper. i am proud the senate is going to pass historic legislation this week to make sure our national parks and other lands have the permanent support they need.  "
8254,2020-06-11,<senatemajldr>, the landmark great american outdoors act will help kentuckians preserve our public lands and ensure that outdoor recreation can continue adding billions of dollars of prosperity to our state every year. i am proud we’re on track to deliver this big win for the bluegrass.  
8255,2020-06-10,<senatemajldr>," our republic can survive a pandemic. it can survive civil unrest. but ideas and deliberation are our foundation. america cannot be america if civil disagreement becomes a contradiction in terms. anti-speech silencing tactics are a cancer in a free and open society.
"
8256,2020-06-10,<senatemajldr>," the liberal tradition in this country used to pride itself on broad-mindedness. but we have spent years watching elite institutions exchange debate and rigor for uniformity and psychological comfort. we saw it with universities. now the free press is repeating that error.
"
8257,2020-06-09,<senatemajldr>," the american people’s response to covid-19 has been brave and patriotic. for months, citizens have sacrificed an enormous amount to protect their neighbors and our medical system. their trust cannot be repaid with constitutionally dubious double standards.
"
8258,2020-06-09,<senatemajldr>," speech, assembly, and the free exercise of religion are all sacrosanct liberties. mayors cannot play ""red-light, green-light"" with the first amendment and cheer certain protests while selectively disadvantaging people of faith. the bill of rights is not an a-la-carte menu.
"
8259,2020-06-09,<senatemajldr>," i strongly &amp; fully support americans' right to peacefully protest. but through no fault of the demonstrators, recent days have revealed glaring inconsistencies from some local leaders. while some mayors cheer mass protests, they continue to ban careful church gatherings.  "
8260,2020-06-08,<senatemajldr>," abolishing police would only take us farther away from the safety, justice, and equal protection of the laws that every single american deserves.  minneapolis cannot really think that arts programs and social workers can make law enforcement obsolete.  my remarks:  "
8261,2020-06-08,<senatemajldr>," every year, millions of americans turn to national parks sites, national wildlife refuges, &amp; millions of acres of public lands for recreation or their livelihoods. legislation from  &amp;  will secure them for generations to come.  "
8262,2020-06-05,<senatemajldr>," today, president trump signed new legislation that will make the ppp even stronger. in addition to  and    and  have been instrumental in keeping this lifeline for main street up and running.
"
8263,2020-06-05,<senatemajldr>," because of the paycheck protection program from  &amp;  tens of millions of americans have kept receiving paychecks instead of pink slips during this emergency, and millions of small businesses have lived to see the reopening.
"
8264,2020-06-05,<senatemajldr>," this crisis is not over. our economic comeback is just beginning. but even in these early days of our careful reopening, the american people are already trouncing expert predictions and starting to come back strong. my full statement:  "
8265,2020-06-04,<senatemajldr>," the chinese communist party has cheated on trade, stolen foreign technology, executed long-term plans to target the industrial bases of the united states and our allies, and weaponized foreign aid to manipulate developing countries. and continued to repress their own people.
"
8266,2020-06-04,<senatemajldr>," thirty-one years ago, brave chinese people flooded tiananmen square because they hoped a more modern and prosperous china would also become more free. what they got was a massacre of hundreds if not thousands and a society that still cannot even speak about it 31 years later.
"
8267,2020-06-04,<senatemajldr>," i am glad president trump has assembled such an impressive team that is working hard for all americans. (3/3)
"
8268,2020-06-04,<senatemajldr>," i appreciate their dedicated work at this difficult time for our nation and their steadfast commitment to their constitutional duties to preserve peace and order, uphold liberty, and protect the american people so they can freely exercise their rights. (2/3)
"
8269,2020-06-04,<senatemajldr>," in these challenging times, the president and the american people are very well-served by the expert advice and principled leadership of people like secretary esper and attorney general barr. (1/3)
"
8270,2020-06-02,<senatemajldr>, our nation is united in horror and opposition to the violent killing of mr. floyd. it is well past time that we also unite on the side of peace in our streets and peace in our communities. we need to unite against these violent riots.  
8271,2020-06-02,<senatemajldr>," every one of us has an obligation to distinguish peaceful protests over the killings of george floyd, breonna taylor, and ahmaud arbery from the violent riots that continue to see innocent people hurt, businesses and neighborhoods destroyed, &amp; law enforcement officers assaulted.
"
8272,2020-06-01,<senatemajldr>," state and local leaders must quickly disrupt outside agitators, restore order, and protect citizens. if they can't or won't, i hope the federal government is ready to stand in the breach.   there is no constitutional right to commit violent crime or terrorize communities. period.  "
8273,2020-06-01,<senatemajldr>, americans have watched peaceful protests hijacked into violent riots that inflict the kind of injustice they supposedly oppose. small businesses destroyed. neighborhoods torn up. police attacked on city streets.   these riots need to stop. not tomorrow. not next week. now.  
8274,2020-06-01,<senatemajldr>," i have fought for civil rights and the first amendment. i completely support americans’ rights to peaceably protest and be heard. our nation cannot deafen itself to the anger, pain, or frustration of black americans. our nation needs to hear this.  "
8275,2020-06-01,<senatemajldr>, but here’s something that requires no investigation: in no world can arresting a man for an alleged minor infraction involve a police officer putting his knee on the man’s neck for nine minutes while he cries out “i can’t breathe” and then goes silent.  
8276,2020-06-01,<senatemajldr>," this is an hour of great pain for our nation. americans everywhere have been grieved and horrified by the killings of african-american citizens. we need the facts, we need the truth, and we need accountability. we need swift justice under law.  "
8277,2020-05-29,<senatemajldr>," our city, our state, and our country have to pull together. my full statement on the protests and riots in louisville and across the country:  "
8278,2020-05-28,<senatemajldr>," our country is starting to carefully re-open. any further legislation will need to focus on practical solutions that help kids return to school next fall, help laid-off americans get re-hired, and stop frivolous lawsuits from stalling our recovery.  "
8279,2020-05-27,<senatemajldr>," from the heroic health professionals at  to the james b. beam institute for kentucky spirits making hand sanitizer, the  has stepped up big-time for the bluegrass. i was proud to lead the senate’s action to help make their work possible.  "
8280,2020-05-26,<senatemajldr>," today i had the honor to thank some of kentucky’s front-line healthcare professionals. when our nation comes through this pandemic, it will be because american heroes like these won this fight.  "
8281,2020-05-26,<senatemajldr>," the cares act is investing billions of dollars into families, healthcare workers, and small businesses across the country. in kentucky, it’s already added up to an $11 billion impact.  "
8282,2020-05-25,<senatemajldr>," as we continue to meet a new generation of american heroes, we set memorial day aside to honor the memory of brave men and women who have laid down their lives in military service. may our actions pay tribute to their tremendous sacrifice for our great nation.  "
8283,2020-05-22,<senatemajldr>, house democrats are playing with perpetual impeachment while the senate fights the pandemic. speaker pelosi is in no position to be lecturing us about what the appropriate use of senate time is. the american people deserve answers and we intend to get them.  
8284,2020-05-22,<senatemajldr>," all month, the senate has been on the job, attending to the needs of our nation. the real contrast is with the house. two days they've been in session in the last eight weeks. at this point, i’m wondering if we should send senators over there to collect their newspapers.  "
8285,2020-05-22,<senatemajldr>," we need to work smart here. help the people who are desperately in need, try to save as many jobs as possible, begin to open up the states, and get this economy growing again.  "
8286,2020-05-21,<senatemajldr>," tune in 📺: i will be joining  ~7:00 pm est to discuss the house democrats’ obsession with impeachment and the senate’s continued focus on coronavirus relief, legal protections for frontline workers, and other key senate priorities.  "
8287,2020-05-21,<senatemajldr>," these past few months have been terrible and trying for our country. but in the midst of this tragedy, our country is pulling together. i’m proud of the ways my fellow kentuckians are showing us how it’s done.  "
8288,2020-05-21,<senatemajldr>," house democrats have been missing in action for months. they just forced through a remote voting scheme so they can continue their absence. but there’s a problem: article i, section 5 of the constitution.  "
8289,2020-05-20,<senatemajldr>," my hometown of louisville, kentucky is home to the baseball bat factory that makes the world-famous louisville slugger. thanks to the paycheck protection program, 171 employees were pulled off furlough and put right back on the payroll.  "
8290,2020-05-20,<senatemajldr>," you can’t make this up: during a global crisis, house democrats are arguing that the acquittal of president trump did not actually end their impeachment. they would rather spend another year trying to cram politics into the legal system than help the senate govern the country.  "
8291,2020-05-20,<senatemajldr>, the senate is working for the american people during this crisis. we’ve been in session for weeks. house democrats have shown up for work two days in eight weeks. they flew into town to pass a far-left wish list that could not even unite their own conference &amp; promptly left town.  
8292,2020-05-19,<senatemajldr>, the senate passed fisa reforms last week. we'll soon confirm a new director of national intelligence. and led by  we’re moving to subpoena people like james comey and loretta lynch to get to the bottom of the 2016 abuses. the american people deserve the truth.  
8293,2020-05-19,<senatemajldr>," democrats spent years hyping the russian collusion conspiracy theory. that collapsed upon investigation. here’s what the facts did turn up: a stunning pattern of incompetence, outright bias, or both that brought federal law enforcement into the 2016 campaign.  "
8294,2020-05-18,<senatemajldr>, i am glad to announce that senator  has accepted my invitation to serve as acting chairman of the senate select committee on intelligence. my full statement:  
8295,2020-05-18,<senatemajldr>, a new generation of american heroes has been called to serve their neighbors and their nation. they are showing up for our country. so the senate is showing up for them.  
8296,2020-05-15,<senatemajldr>, the house has been at home for two months. they gave themselves no assignments except developing this proposal. yet it still reads like the speaker of the house pasted together random ideas from her most liberal members and slapped the word “coronavirus” on top of it.  
8297,2020-05-15,<senatemajldr>," this week speaker pelosi published an 1,800-page catalog of left-wing oddities &amp; called it a coronavirus relief bill. it proposes tax hikes on small business, giveaways to blue-state millionaires, checks for illegal immigrants, and diversity detectives for the cannabis industry.  "
8298,2020-05-15,<senatemajldr>," forget about this $3 trillion left-wing wish list that even house democrats are criticizing. republicans are focused on practical solutions like legal liability protections for medical workers and the schools, universities, and businesses that will be trying to re-open.  "
8299,2020-05-15,<senatemajldr>," 80,000 americans have died. more than 20 million have lost their jobs. most people call that a crisis. but leading democrats call it “leverage.”   a co-chair of the congressional progressive caucus: “for me, the leverage is that there is enormous suffering.”  "
8300,2020-05-15,<senatemajldr>, the democrats’ supposed coronavirus bill includes taxpayer-funded studies to measure “diversity and inclusion” in the cannabis industry. it’s a parade of absurdities that can hardly be taken seriously.  
8301,2020-05-15,<senatemajldr>, washington democrats have been transparent: they see this national tragedy as a ripe partisan opportunity to pass long-standing wish-list items that are completely unrelated to the crisis itself.  
8302,2020-05-15,<senatemajldr>," the coronavirus pandemic is a serious crisis, so the senate’s response has been serious. the senate took a blank sheet of paper, turned it into the largest rescue package in history, and passed it unanimously.  "
8303,2020-05-14,<senatemajldr>, tune in 📺: i will be joining  ~6:15 pm est to discuss house democrats’ unserious $3 trillion wish list and what the senate is doing to attack this crisis and lead the response.  
8304,2020-05-14,<senatemajldr>," the senate will keep working seriously on this serious pandemic. we wrote the cares act. now we’re back in washington. we’re holding hearings with experts about the re-opening. we’re monitoring testing. we’re drafting legal protections for healthcare workers and small businesses.
"
8305,2020-05-14,<senatemajldr>," house democrats had a blank slate to propose any vision for the recovery. this draft is all they have done for two months. and they came up with: tax hikes on small businesses, tax cuts for blue-state millionaires, and taxpayer-funded diversity detectives for the pot industry.
"
8306,2020-05-14,<senatemajldr>," house democrats’ huge new bill would cut taxes for blue-state millionaires, send government checks to illegal immigrants, and — wait for it — mandate two separate taxpayer-funded studies of diversity in the cannabis industry. this is their effort at coronavirus relief?
"
8307,2020-05-13,<senatemajldr>, the paycheck protection program is continuing to provide critical relief for small businesses across america. the manufacturer of louisville slugger bats says it put 171 furloughed employees back on the payroll after receiving a loan.  
8308,2020-05-12,<senatemajldr>," senate republicans are preparing a major package of covid-related liability reforms to foster economic recovery. we are going to provide certainty. if we want american workers to clock back in, we need employers to know they will not be left to drown in opportunistic litigation.
"
8309,2020-05-12,<senatemajldr>," more than two-thirds of independent business owners say they are worried about a legal liability minefield getting in the way of re-opening. the senate majority is not going to stand idly by and let trial lawyers vacuum up relief money &amp; redirect it into their own pockets.
"
8310,2020-05-11,<senatemajldr>," during the pandemic, our nation continues to meet new american heroes &amp; draw inspiration from their stories. today i introduced the country to another incredible kentuckian: a 30-year veteran nurse who contracted the virus, beat it, &amp; then went back to caring for patients.  "
8311,2020-05-11,<senatemajldr>," the paycheck protection program is helping nearly 42,000 kentucky job creators &amp; millions of small businesses nationwide access emergency cash. this program is a lifeline for american workers and main streets across the country.  "
8312,2020-05-10,<senatemajldr>, thinking of my mom julia today. happy mother’s day to all the moms in kentucky and across our great country.  
8313,2020-05-08,<senatemajldr>," today was also meant to be the dedication for the eisenhower memorial. but as in ike’s time, a monumental challenge has intervened — one that demands american strength and leadership to resolve. thank you to  for your work in making this fitting memorial a reality.
"
8314,2020-05-08,<senatemajldr>," today marks 75 years since v-e day, the end of wwii in europe. as americans work together to emerge from a global crisis, we’re reminded of the essential role our nation played in leading the world out of another.
"
8315,2020-05-07,<senatemajldr>," strong legal protections will be essential as our economy reopens. as of a week ago, 771 lawsuits had already been filed against everyone from workers on the front lines to universities to businesses. our rescue efforts cannot get diverted into a huge giveaway for trial lawyers.  "
8316,2020-05-07,<senatemajldr>," the chinese communist party even used the pandemic as cover to arrest peaceful hong kong democracy activists, including my old friend martin lee. i suppose they thought the rest of the world might be too distracted to notice. they were mistaken.
"
8317,2020-05-07,<senatemajldr>," our national day of prayer certainly comes at the right time this year. let’s pray for everyone who is sick and suffering with the coronavirus, struggling with unemployment and isolation, or working on the front lines to care for strangers and keep our nation going.  "
8318,2020-05-07,<senatemajldr>," tune in 📺: i will be joining  ~2:00 pm est to discuss the senate's role in continuing to strengthen our health response, pivoting towards recovery, and other crucial legislation.
"
8319,2020-05-07,<senatemajldr>," this pandemic originated in china. its global spread was made worse by china’s unconscionable efforts to cover it up. working closely with our allies and partners around the world, the u.s. will be asking tough questions about our relationship with the chinese communist party.
"
8320,2020-05-07,<senatemajldr>," while we fight covid-19, we can’t forget all the other threats we still face. terrorist cells, hostile foreign intelligence services, and adversaries all over the world who would be thrilled if the u.s. applies social distancing to our presence on the world stage as well.
"
8321,2020-05-06,<senatemajldr>," every day, i hear more inspiring stories from my home state about kentuckians finding creative ways to pitch in. this crisis is creating new heroes in new ways every day. i could not be prouder to represent the bluegrass and bring #kentucky’s voice to the senate.  "
8322,2020-05-06,<senatemajldr>, judge justin walker is a brilliant legal expert whose record earns praise all across the political spectrum. he is so qualified and fair-minded that he's even won the blessing of the left-leaning american bar association that democrats themselves call “the gold standard.”  
8323,2020-05-06,<senatemajldr>," the senate is not going to let either the coronavirus or reflexive partisanship stop us from doing crucial national business. we are elected to do our jobs. i’m glad we’ll have a senate-confirmed counterintelligence leader by the end of the day.
"
8324,2020-05-06,<senatemajldr>," even though the democrats’ own top member on the intelligence committee praises this nominee and wants a swift confirmation, senate democrats still forced us to use hours of floor time and multiple votes, as if he were controversial. this is what i've called mindless obstruction.
"
8325,2020-05-06,<senatemajldr>," today the senate will confirm a director for the national counterintelligence and security center. our domestic fight with the coronavirus makes it even more important, not less important, that we also maintain global vigilance and keep a close eye on those who wish us harm.
"
8326,2020-05-06,<senatemajldr>," nurses in #kentucky and across america are rushing toward the sick, washing their hands until they bleed, and working around the clock to heal strangers and fight the coronavirus. today and every day, we salute you.  "

8338,2020-04-27,<senatemajldr>," if it is essential for doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, truck drivers, grocery-store workers, and other brave americans to keep carefully manning their duty stations, then it is essential for senators to carefully man ours and support them. we are reconvening next week.  "

"
8341,2020-04-24,<senatemajldr>," the senate's historic cares act is the largest rescue package in american history. it is already sending hundreds of billions of dollars to struggling small businesses, hard-hit hospitals, testing, very targeted covid-19 help for states and localities, and direct aid to families.

"
8343,2020-04-23,<senatemajldr>," historic, tragic layoffs continue to pile up nationwide. this pandemic has erased a decade of job creation in just over one month.   democrats should never have made the paycheck protection program lapse. the house must follow the senate’s lead and vote today to re-open it.

8347,2020-04-21,<senatemajldr>, martin lee is an old friend of mine. he’s a brave and steady voice for the freedom and autonomy of hong kong. the authorities just had him arrested. his new op-ed is essential reading:  
8348,2020-04-21,<senatemajldr>, i’m proud of congress’s new bipartisan agreement. i am just sorry that democrats shut down emergency support for main street in a search for partisan “leverage” that never materialized.   it’s time to move forward together and get this done for the american people.  
8349,2020-04-21,<senatemajldr>," i am encouraged that democrats have finally agreed to reopen the paycheck protection program and abandon a number of their unrelated demands. my full statement on congress’s new bipartisan agreement to provide additional small-business support, more funding for testing, and more:  "
8350,2020-04-20,<senatemajldr>," it’s been four days since the paycheck protection program ran dry. republicans have been trying to fund this job-saving program for over a week, but democrats have blocked us. the senate will meet again tomorrow. i hope my colleagues will finally let this help move forward.
"
8351,2020-04-18,<senatemajldr>, these outrageous arrests are just one more example of beijing’s shameful efforts to strangle the freedom and autonomy of hong kongers. i wrote about these coordinated efforts last year:  
8352,2020-04-18,<senatemajldr>, the chinese communist party should not be allowed to use a pandemic — which they exacerbated through secrecy and inaction — as cover for its agents to arrest peaceful pro-democracy leaders. we stand with hong kong.  
8353,2020-04-18,<senatemajldr>," the paycheck protection program ran dry on thursday and democrats continue to block more funding. democrats must let us reopen this crucial program before more americans are laid off needlessly and more small businesses are shuttered that could have survived.
"
8354,2020-04-17,<senatemajldr>," chairman  will coordinate senate-wide oversight of the historic cares act, and i am appointing  to the five-member congressional oversight commission. i am grateful that these expert leaders are stepping up.  "
8355,2020-04-17,<senatemajldr>, twenty million americans have lost their jobs in one month. we badly need the bipartisan paycheck protection program to keep saving more small businesses. but democrats have been blocking its funding for over a week and now this crucial program is shut down.  
8356,2020-04-16,<senatemajldr>, five million more americans lost their jobs just last week.  that makes 20 million layoffs in one month.   americans need democrats to stop blocking emergency paycheck money and let this job-saving program reopen.  i hope our colleagues come around soon.  
8357,2020-04-16,<senatemajldr>," even now, senate democrats are still blocking funding for the paycheck protection program.    it is surreal to see democratic leaders treat support for workers and small businesses as something they need to be goaded into supporting.  "
8358,2020-04-16,<senatemajldr>," one week ago, i warned that the paycheck protection program was running out of money and tried to a pass clean funding bill. senate democrats blocked it.  here we are, a week later, with no progress. this morning, the ppp ran out of money and shut down, just as we’d warned.  "
8359,2020-04-16,<senatemajldr>," republicans tried to pass more money for americans’ paychecks last week. democrats blocked it. speaker pelosi said she saw “no data as to why we need it."" she said ""we have time to negotiate.”   democrats did nothing and now the program has shut down.
"
8360,2020-04-16,<senatemajldr>," millions more americans are losing their jobs every week. absolutely crushing.   republicans have spent a week trying to fund the bipartisan paycheck protection program so more americans can keep their jobs.   democrats are blocking the money and making the program run dry.
"
8361,2020-04-15,<senatemajldr>, the cost of continued democratic obstruction on the paycheck protection program will be pink slips and shuttered businesses. funding for a bipartisan program should not be a partisan issue. my joint statement with   
8362,2020-04-15,<senatemajldr>, the paycheck protection program will run out of money in a matter of hours. it has been stunning to watch our democratic colleagues treat emergency funding for americans’ paychecks like a republican priority which they need to be goaded into supporting.  
8363,2020-04-15,<senatemajldr>, icymi🎤: i joined  washington watch with tony perkins to discuss our work on the coronavirus crisis and the importance of an independent judiciary to protecting our constitution.  
8364,2020-04-14,<senatemajldr>, tune in🎤: i will be speaking to  washington watch with tony perkins at ~5:00 pm to discuss the coronavirus crisis and judge walker's ruling defending kentuckians’ religious liberty.  
8365,2020-04-14,<senatemajldr>," clean funding for worker pay in a crisis should not be controversial. i hope our democratic colleagues will let congress act this week. american workers deserve paychecks, not pink slips caused by political games.  "
8366,2020-04-13,<senatemajldr>," last week, democrats objected to a clean funding increase for the crucial paycheck protection program – even though it’s on track to run out of funding as soon as this week.   american workers deserve better than political games.
"
8367,2020-04-12,<senatemajldr>," today, even at a distance, christians are united by the triumph of the resurrection. i wish my fellow kentuckians and all who celebrate a very happy and blessed easter.
"
8368,2020-04-11,<senatemajldr>," exactly. elaine and i will be celebrating easter at home. i encourage all kentuckians to do likewise and to follow all cdc guidance. but governments need to protect citizens’ health without trampling basic constitutional principles at the same time.
"
8369,2020-04-11,<senatemajldr>," grateful for this strong, eloquent ruling defending kentuckians’ religious liberty from judge justin walker,  outstanding nominee for the d.c. circuit. of course church parking lots cannot be singled out with unfair standards that differ from other establishments.
"
8370,2020-04-11,<senatemajldr>, i issued the following statement with  on the urgent need to replenish the paycheck protection program. there is no excuse for a lack of urgency. american jobs are literally at stake.  
8371,2020-04-10,<senatemajldr>," small business layoffs spiked 1,000% last month. 10% of the u.s. workforce is now jobless. this is no time for political games.  i hope democrats stop blocking more funding for the paycheck protection program very soon. american jobs depend on it.  "
8372,2020-04-09,<senatemajldr>," thanks to the cares act, healthcare providers that participate in the medicare program will receive a direct deposit in their bank accounts from  in kentucky and across america, we must keep our hospitals and their brave workers equipped for success.
"
8373,2020-04-09,<senatemajldr>," we just found out that 16 million americans have been laid off in three weeks. a staggering 10% of the labor force is now out of work. this is a crisis. no time for partisan maneuvering or politics as usual. i hope democrats reverse course &amp; let us increase paycheck support soon.
"
8374,2020-04-09,<senatemajldr>," senate democrats just blocked urgent money for a popular, bipartisan job-saving program which they themselves literally coauthored with us two weeks ago. i complimented both sides and asked to increase the dollar amount without changing anything else. but they blocked it.
"
8375,2020-04-08,<senatemajldr>," i hope none of my colleagues object to my request for these urgently-needed funds. there is no reason why this bipartisan job-saving program should be held hostage for other priorities. let's re-fund the only program that's already running dry and keep moving forward together.
"
8376,2020-04-08,<senatemajldr>," ten million americans were laid off in just the last two weeks. tomorrow morning will likely bring another historic unemployment figure. this is urgent. if senators delay this urgent paycheck support to insist on a broader bill, more americans will lose their jobs unnecessarily.
"
8377,2020-04-08,<senatemajldr>," if we want to act fast, congress has to focus. there is no realistic chance that another sprawling bill which allocates half a trillion dollars to a number of priorities, even important ones, will be able to pass the senate or the house by unanimous consent this week.
"
8378,2020-04-08,<senatemajldr>," nobody thinks tomorrow will be the senate’s last word on covid-19. other crucial parts of the cares act, like its historic funds for hospitals and healthcare providers, are still coming online and have not yet been exhausted. the ppp is where the lights are already flashing red.
"
8379,2020-04-08,<senatemajldr>," tomorrow morning, i’ll ask unanimous consent to pass standalone emergency funding for the hugely popular paycheck protection program that is saving small-business jobs as we speak. as the rest of the cares act continues to come online, this key part is already low on funds.
"
8380,2020-04-08,<senatemajldr>," the restaurant workers relief program was created to serve fellow kentuckians in louisville. now, it’s expanding to serve more than 50,000 hot meals to service industry workers and their families across the country.  "
8381,2020-04-08,<senatemajldr>," god’s pantry has been busy during the coronavirus pandemic, and the  has been there to help, packing 10k boxes of food for those in need across the commonwealth. thank you to our kentucky guard for showing that we’re all in this together.  "
8382,2020-04-07,<senatemajldr>, i will work with secretary mnuchin and leader schumer and hope to approve further funding for the paycheck protection program by unanimous consent or voice vote during the next scheduled senate session on thursday.  
8383,2020-04-07,<senatemajldr>," even as the cares act continues to come online, it is clear that the small-business paycheck protection program will need more funding. congress needs to act with speed and focus to provide more money for this crucial and bipartisan program.  "
8384,2020-04-06,<senatemajldr>, more inspiring examples of kentuckians helping kentuckians: colleges and universities across the commonwealth are stepping up to make and donate protective equipment for front line health care workers.  
8385,2020-04-06,<senatemajldr>," federal, state, and local officials in kentucky are working overtime together to assist those in need. and citizens across the commonwealth are stepping up and finding creative ways to pitch in and help others.  united we stand, divided we fall.  "
8386,2020-04-03,<senatemajldr>, the most important thing that we can do for our nation’s small businesses &amp; their employees is to provide them resources to weather this storm. that’s exactly why the senate wrote and passed the cares act.  
8387,2020-04-03,<senatemajldr>," senate republicans are closely tracking the implementation of our historic cares act as the administration puts it into effect for the american people. we are committed to supporting american workers, families, and small businesses as our nation confronts this historic emergency.
"
8388,2020-04-03,<senatemajldr>," i’m glad speaker pelosi is again standing down from efforts to use this crisis to push unrelated left-wing priorities. the latest proposal had been a massive tax-code giveaway for wealthy people in blue states that was instantly panned by economists across the spectrum.
"
8389,2020-04-03,<senatemajldr>," i am proud that president trump’s search took him outside the beltway and into the bluegrass. judge walker is a brilliant and fair jurist who reveres the constitution. he’s a leading light in a new generation of federal judges.
"
8390,2020-04-03,<senatemajldr>," judge justin walker,  choice to serve on the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit, is an outstanding legal scholar. president trump has chosen a rising kentucky star to refresh a crucial federal court. my statement:  "
8391,2020-04-02,<senatemajldr>," every american is feeling the effects of the coronavirus. it’s a national health &amp; economic emergency that demanded action. i’m proud that the biggest rescue package in history, led by senate republicans, will help workers &amp; families respond.  "
8392,2020-04-02,<senatemajldr>," i’m grateful to kentuckians who are stepping up to show compassion and resolve. it’s because of stories like this that we will make it through this. we are all in this together, even if we have to stand six feet apart.  "
8393,2020-04-01,<senatemajldr>," house democrats are still trying to use this crisis to push unrelated pet priorities.   last week: carbon regulations.   now? a tax giveaway for wealthy people in blue states, panned by economists across the spectrum.   this is a crisis. let's act like it.  "
8394,2020-04-01,<senatemajldr>, i made sure the historic cares act did not leave states like kentucky behind. i am glad the first federal funds are already starting to flow to local governments to help kentuckians weather this health crisis and economic emergency.  
8395,2020-04-01,<senatemajldr>, icymi🎙: i joined  with  to discuss the cares act. this was the third coronavirus bill that we've passed and the biggest one by far. it was crafted by a republican majority in the senate and approved without a single dissenting vote.

8398,2020-03-30,<senatemajldr>," today is #nationaldoctorsday. thank you to our american heroes who wear scrubs and masks. who rush toward the sick, wash their hands until they bleed, and work around the clock to heal our loved ones. we salute doctors along with nurses and all of our healthcare professionals.
"
8399,2020-03-30,<senatemajldr>, from bourbon and spirits to hand sanitizer. i am proud of our great #kentucky distillers and all of our job creators who are stepping up to help their neighbors during this emergency.  
8400,2020-03-28,<senatemajldr>," the senate mourns our friend tom coburn. seventy-two years was far too few for someone this brilliant, this tireless, and this dedicated to serving others. we stand in prayer with his beloved wife carolyn and the entire coburn family. my full statement:  "
8401,2020-03-27,<senatemajldr>," it was an honor to join  at the white house today for the signing of the cares act.   the american people needed this rescue package. they needed it quickly. and the senate delivered, 96-0. it's a proud moment for our country.  "
8402,2020-03-27,<senatemajldr>," . just signed the cares act. the senate's bold legislation is now law.  it will get emergency cash to families and small businesses and surge resources to doctors, nurses, hospitals, and the race for new treatments and vaccines. #weareallinthistogether
"
8403,2020-03-27,<senatemajldr>," icymi 🎤: i joined  to discuss how the senate’s historic cares act will put emergency cash into the hands of american families who need it the most.   as our nation battles this virus, let’s continue to pray for one another, for all of our families, &amp; for our country.  "
8404,2020-03-27,<senatemajldr>," icymi📺: last night, i joined  with  to discuss the senate’s historic response to the coronavirus, which will rush much needed aid to our brave medical professionals and relief to families and small businesses.  "
8405,2020-03-25,<senatemajldr>," the senate just pivoted from one of the most divided periods in recent memory to passing the largest rescue package in american history. and we passed it unanimously.   americans deserved this outcome. i am proud the senate stepped up.
"
8406,2020-03-25,<senatemajldr>," our nation will meet a lot of new heroes — from first responders to grocery clerks to delivery drivers. most of all, we'll meet a whole lot of heroes in scrubs working to heal the sick. when our nation comes through this, it will be because american heroes won this fight.  "
8407,2020-03-24,<senatemajldr>," at last, we have a deal.   after days of intense discussions, the senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic.   we’re going to pass this legislation later today.

8408,2020-03-24,<senatemajldr>," small businesses, working families, and medical responders across our country need help now.  that's why the senate is working non-stop on a bipartisan agreement on bold, urgent relief.   we can’t afford to waste another moment.  "
8409,2020-03-23,<senatemajldr>," every day, this economic crisis deepens and more americans lose their jobs.   senate democrats are blocking emergency loans to small businesses, direct checks for americans, and even a huge expansion of unemployment benefits during the emergency.  "
8410,2020-03-23,<senatemajldr>, these are just some of the unrelated demands senate democrats have used to slow relief for workers and families:   ✖️ tax credits for solar and wind energy ✖️ special treatment for big labor ✖️ airlines' emissions standards   this is a crisis. why is only one side acting like it?  
8411,2020-03-22,<senatemajldr>," our nation cannot afford this game of chicken. we cannot afford the cynical partisanship.  this is a national emergency. not a partisan opportunity.  doctors, nurses, small business employees, laid-off americans, and vulnerable seniors need help right now.  "
8412,2020-03-22,<senatemajldr>," the american people expect us to act. if we fail, it will be because senate democrats are continuing to dither while the country expects bold, bipartisan action.  "
8413,2020-03-22,<senatemajldr>," this morning i hosted a meeting with congressional leadership and sec. mnuchin. it is time to come together, finalize the results of our bipartisan discussions, and get the cares act to the president’s desk.  "
8414,2020-03-21,<senatemajldr>," the past two days of intense bipartisan talks are very close to a resolution. an update on the coronavirus aid, relief, &amp; economic security act:  "
8415,2020-03-21,<senatemajldr>," more americans are being laid off every day. more small businesses are being forced to shed payroll every day. our nurses and doctors need key supplies.   nobody should view this as political opportunity for either side. this is a national emergency.   it is time to come together
"
8416,2020-03-21,<senatemajldr>," kentucky’s state motto is “united we stand, divided we fall.” i’m inspired by all the kentuckians who are stepping up to serve their neighbors and showing washington how it’s done.   united we stand — even if we have to stand six feet apart for a few weeks.  "

8426,2020-03-20,<senatemajldr>," senate republicans’ proposal, the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act, will get cash assistance in the hands of individuals and families and rush urgent relief for small businesses and their employees:  "

8428,2020-03-19,<senatemajldr>," the senate is not going anywhere until we act. senate republicans are here and ready to work with our democratic colleagues and the administration to get results as soon as possible.  let’s get this done for the country.
"
8429,2020-03-19,<senatemajldr>," the coronavirus aid, relief, &amp; economic security act proposes bold action on four urgent priorities:  1. direct financial help for americans  2. relief for small businesses &amp; their employees 3. more stability for our economy 4. more support for patients &amp; healthcare professionals

8433,2020-03-19,<senatemajldr>," we know our economy won’t bounce back to normal tomorrow. an underlying medical reality is driving this disruption. this about immediately helping workers, families, small businesses, and positioning us to thrive on the other side.  america is strong and we will beat this virus.  "
8434,2020-03-19,<senatemajldr>," the american people are strong. the american people will win this fight against the coronavirus.  the senate’s job is to give them the tools to make that happen.  and we are not leaving until we do our job.
"
8435,2020-03-19,<senatemajldr>," this crisis is moving fast. our health system is under strain and our economy is hurting. it is critical that we act swiftly and boldly to stabilize our economy, preserve americans’ jobs, get money to workers and families, &amp; keep up our fight on the health front.
"

"
8439,2020-03-18,<senatemajldr>," the senate is going to vote on the house’s proposal. i will support it. but it does not help enough americans and, crucially, it adds even more uncertainty for small businesses. it will make it all the more urgent for the senate to pass bold legislation to help small businesses.

"
8446,2020-03-16,<senatemajldr>," the senate is still waiting for the house to finish processing their coronavirus legislation and transmit their final version to us.   senators on both sides are eager to act quickly to support american workers, families, and small businesses.

8449,2020-03-13,<senatemajldr>, my statement on president trump’s actions today and the house-passed coronavirus legislation:  
8450,2020-03-12,<senatemajldr>, . bipartisan prep act would expand medical professionals’ access to vitally-needed respirators and create certainty for mask manufacturers. it is not controversial. the senate could have passed it today.  but senate democrats refused to let it move forward.  
8451,2020-03-12,<senatemajldr>," notwithstanding the scheduled state work period, the senate will be in session next week. i am glad talks are ongoing between the administration and speaker pelosi. i hope congress can pass bipartisan legislation to continue combating the coronavirus and keep our economy strong.
"
8452,2020-03-12,<senatemajldr>," fortunately, we do not need to choose between speaker pelosi’s first draft and doing nothing. i am glad the administration is continuing talks. the senate is ready to consider a bipartisan, bicameral package if house democrats return to the table &amp; work with the president's team.
"
8453,2020-03-12,<senatemajldr>," unfortunately, speaker pelosi’s first draft from late last night was off-base. it does not focus immediate relief on affected americans. it proposes new bureaucracy that would only delay assistance. it wanders into policy areas that are not related to the pressing issues at hand.
"
8454,2020-03-12,<senatemajldr>," i applaud sec. mnuchin and the administration for engaging in bipartisan talks with speaker pelosi. following the billions in health funding we approved last week, the senate is ready and eager to consider bipartisan policies to mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus.
"
8455,2020-03-11,<senatemajldr>, my home state of kentucky currently has eight confirmed coronavirus cases. i applaud the efforts of state and local leaders who are working together with federal officials to proceed carefully and intelligently.  
8456,2020-03-11,<senatemajldr>, i strongly support the fisa legislation that just passed the house by a wide bipartisan majority. it will reauthorize vital tools for our national security while implementing reforms to address the abuses we saw in 2016. our full joint statement:  
8457,2020-03-11,<senatemajldr>, election security has come a long way since the passivity &amp; failures of the obama administration in 2016. but this work is not finished. we must stay vigilant — all of us. federal leaders. state &amp; local elections officials. we all have a part to play in protecting our democracy.  
8458,2020-03-11,<senatemajldr>, congress has acted proactively by providing billions in funding to health leaders as they combat this virus on the front lines. i am confident we can bring the same bipartisan energy to any steps that prove necessary to support our strong &amp; healthy u.s. economy.  
8459,2020-03-10,<senatemajldr>," we have not had a major update of our energy laws in over a decade. let’s not squander this opportunity. let’s get this done. the american people deserve this commonsense, bipartisan legislation.  "
8460,2020-03-10,<senatemajldr>," this coronavirus poses a challenge, no question. but our nation is strong, we are well equipped, and we have overcome far greater challenges before.  as the  put it yesterday: “we’re all in this together.”  "
8461,2020-03-10,<senatemajldr>," i encourage all my senate colleagues to attend today’s briefing on election security. a subject this serious demands some bipartisanship and unity. let’s keep the focus on fighting against foreign interference, not fighting each other.
"
8462,2020-03-10,<senatemajldr>," the time is now for all americans to engage in basic common-sense measures, and for americans at heightened risk to take additional precautions. the experts’ detailed recommendations for individuals, families, and employers are available online at  "
8463,2020-03-09,<senatemajldr>, officials in my home state of kentucky are currently monitoring four confirmed coronavirus cases. i spoke to the governor this morning and will continue to stay in close touch to make sure that kentucky — and all 50 states — have what they need and know congress has their back.  
8464,2020-03-09,<senatemajldr>," the green new deal is 100% the wrong way to think about american energy dominance. fortunately, the legislation before the senate now gets it right: the bipartisan american energy innovation act.  "
8465,2020-03-09,<senatemajldr>," congress is making sure our health experts &amp; leaders have the funding they need to combat the coronavirus. we passed nearly $8b in supplemental funding. these surge resources will help public health leaders, researchers, &amp; state and local governments work to protect americans.
"
8466,2020-03-06,<senatemajldr>," i hope we can restore the bipartisan consensus that has served our nation, israel, and the world so well. but we need to fight for it. #aipac2020
"
8467,2020-03-06,<senatemajldr>, i’ve worked my whole career to stand against anti-semitism. we must denounce it wherever it emerges.   this is a responsibility that all americans must share.  
8468,2020-03-06,<senatemajldr>, thank you  for coming to washington. it’s an honor to work in the senate on behalf of #kentucky farm families.  
8469,2020-03-06,<senatemajldr>," in a time of intense partisanship, republicans &amp; democrats came together in a matter of days, reached an agreement with the administration, and just signed into law a bipartisan, bicameral response to help healthcare professionals combat the coronavirus.  "
8470,2020-03-05,<senatemajldr>, 📺 tune in: i will be joining  with  ~11:00pm et to discuss coronavirus funding and senator schumer's attack on scotus.   
8471,2020-03-05,<senatemajldr>, independence from political passions is the cornerstone of the judiciary in this country. it has almost been a century since the last time democrats threatened to pack the supreme court b/c they wanted different rulings. history still judges that disgraceful episode to this day  
8472,2020-03-05,<senatemajldr>, the left-wing campaign against the federal judiciary did not begin yesterday. there is a clear record of democrats threatening the judicial independence of the supreme court:  
8473,2020-03-05,<senatemajldr>," every time democrats try to threaten sitting justices, we are reminded exactly why the framers gave them life tenure and salary protection. republicans are absolutely and unshakably committed to the core constitutional principle of an independent federal judiciary.  "
8474,2020-03-05,<senatemajldr>," contrary to what the democratic leader has tried to claim, he very clearly was not addressing republican lawmakers. the minority leader of the united states senate threatened two associate justices of the u.s. supreme court. period.  "
8475,2020-03-04,<senatemajldr>," i’m grateful to  &amp; senator  for their strong leadership on securing funding for conserving our land and water.
"
8476,2020-03-04,<senatemajldr>," experts estimated the #greennewdeal could have cost the u.s. more than the gdp of the entire world. instead, the bipartisan american energy innovation act we’re considering will direct responsible and targeted investment toward key energy priorities.  "
8477,2020-03-04,<senatemajldr>," this moment calls for collaboration and unity to combat the coronavirus. bicameral, bipartisan talks have made great headway on a funding package. it’s time to get it done and give our public health experts and healthcare professionals the surge resources they need.
"
8478,2020-03-03,<senatemajldr>," on the coronavirus, the senate’s immediate role is clear: we need to support the federal, state, and local health officials and healthcare professionals who are working overtime to blunt, delay, and mitigate the spread of the virus.  "
8479,2020-03-03,<senatemajldr>," the american energy innovation act, put forward by chairman  is thoroughly bipartisan. it takes proactive steps to ensure the security, efficiency, and affordability of american energy for years to come.  "
8480,2020-03-03,<senatemajldr>," the american people deserve a debate about how best to stand with israel. how best to lead in the world. not whether to do so at all.  i hope we can restore the bipartisan consensus that has served our nation, israel, and the world so well. but we need to fight for it. #aipac2020
"
8481,2020-03-03,<senatemajldr>," i’ve worked my whole career to stand against anti-semitism. i’ve called it out whenever i see it. but around this time last year, house democrat leaders had difficulty doing even that.   this is a responsibility that all americans must share. #aipac2020
"
8482,2020-03-03,<senatemajldr>," we can't ignore that in today’s democratic party, what were once easy questions have become divisive flash points:  standing with israel. maintaining our presence in the middle east.    increasingly these things are controversial. #aipac2020
"
8483,2020-03-03,<senatemajldr>," in many ways, #aipac2020 marks a promising time for the u.s.-israel relationship. we in the pro-israel community have much to celebrate.   but we must also be honest and clear-eyed about challenges. and that includes a dangerous shift in our politics here at home.
"
8484,2020-03-03,<senatemajldr>, i am proud to join  in witnessing to the world-changing friendship between the united states and israel. join me live at #aipac2020  
8485,2020-03-02,<senatemajldr>," after years in afghanistan, two things are clear:   1. we should welcome any serious opportunity to bring greater stability.  2. and we must make certain that the progress won through great sacrifice is not undermined by any precipitous rush for the exits.  "
8486,2020-03-02,<senatemajldr>, i am grateful that the lynchpin of  agreement with the taliban is a conditions-based approach that will give our commanders leverage to test the taliban’s will to abide by it. this war is not over. but this agreement may foster the negotiations to bring it toward a close.  
8487,2020-03-02,<senatemajldr>," i’m glad that our prospects for supplemental coronavirus appropriations rest in the hands of a bipartisan group of negotiators. i would encourage my democratic colleagues to let them do their work. it will be important to pass this first benchmark &amp; supply these important funds.
"
8488,2020-03-02,<senatemajldr>," it goes without saying that a challenge like the coronavirus leaves no time for moving goalposts or performative outrage. the american people deserve for congress to meet this subject head-on with a bipartisan and collaborative approach.
"
8489,2020-02-28,<senatemajldr>, 📺i sat down with   to discuss reshaping the courts &amp; defending innocent human life:  
8490,2020-02-28,<senatemajldr>, thank you  for the warm reception. it’s an honor to work in the senate on behalf of #kentucky farm families and represent the home of great statesmen like henry clay and abraham lincoln. #kyindc  
8491,2020-02-27,<senatemajldr>," the continued spread of the new coronavirus, covid-19, has the world on notice. congress’s task is to make sure that the administration and our dedicated medical professionals have what they need to continue preparing in ways that are calm, smart, and effective.  "
8492,2020-02-26,<senatemajldr>," for generations, our nation has been powered by workers like the miners in kentucky’s coal fields. i was honored to protect their pension benefits. i am proud to stand with and support our miners and their families.   "
8493,2020-02-26,<senatemajldr>," it’s an honor to be among  friends. thank you for coming to washington to speak for our agricultural communities and rural values. with your advocacy, i’m going to keep putting the priorities of #kentucky families at the center of the national discussion. #kyindc  "
8494,2020-02-25,<senatemajldr>," do our democratic colleagues really believe that what our country needs is a radical fringe position on elective abortion that we only share with china, north korea, and four other countries in the entire world?  "
8495,2020-02-25,<senatemajldr>," today, every senator will be able to take a clear moral stand. we’ll have the chance to proceed to two commonsense pieces of legislation that would move our nation closer to the international mainstream with respect to defending innocent human life.  "
8496,2020-02-21,<senatemajldr>," invasive #asiancarp presents a serious danger to kentucky's pristine waters which impacts anglers, boaters, &amp; businesses. #kentucky continues to lead the national fight against asian carp &amp; i'm proud to work w/local leaders &amp; president trump to protect our communities &amp; economy.  "
8497,2020-02-20,<senatemajldr>," #kentucky’s treasured coal communities are a central part of our commonwealth’s heritage. i am proud to stand with our coal miners and their families. together, president trump and i have ended obama’s regulatory war on coal. now we’re doing all we can to repair the damage.
"
8498,2020-02-19,<senatemajldr>," individuals trapped in a cycle of addiction often need assistance to find living &amp; employment, which are vital to their long-term recovery. i am proud that my career act, which supports transitional housing &amp; authorizes an increase in funding, is delivering for kentuckians.
"
8499,2020-02-17,<senatemajldr>, today we celebrate the presidents who’ve defended and shaped our great nation — especially george washington and kentucky’s son abraham lincoln. happy #presidentsday.  
8500,2020-02-14,<senatemajldr>," in divided government, we have to work on things we agree on.  house democrats’ left-wing fantasies like the green new deal and medicare-for-none are nonstarters.  "
8501,2020-02-14,<senatemajldr>, my job is to set the priorities. i think the most important long-term thing we can do for the country is confirming men and women who believe their job is to actually interpret the law as it is written. it’s my top priority.  
8502,2020-02-14,<senatemajldr>," 📺last night with    ""let’s put it this way: you saw the democrats couldn't even put on a caucus in iowa. i don't think the country would be better off to put them in charge of our health care.""  "
8503,2020-02-13,<senatemajldr>, watch📺: tonight at ~ 6:00pm et on  i’ll be joining  to discuss the conclusion of the impeachment trial and the senate’s legislative accomplishments.  
8504,2020-02-13,<senatemajldr>, this president’s opponents talk all the time about defending norms and institutions. that talk proved very cheap. this partisan impeachment was a series of attacks on the bedrock institutions of our republic.  
8505,2020-02-13,<senatemajldr>," in order to politically attack one president they do not like, washington democrats proved willing to attack our underlying institutions themselves — the house, the senate, the office of the presidency, and even the supreme court. all for short-term partisan gain.  "
8506,2020-02-13,<senatemajldr>," before democrats’ reckless impeachment moves fully into the rear-view mirror, i spoke again on the senate floor about the partisan abuses that drove this process and why they must never happen again.  "
8507,2020-02-12,<senatemajldr>," i was honored to meet with representatives of the thousands of brave men and women in #kentucky law enforcement who protect our communities. i’ve always been proud to work with them on keeping our officers safe. #kyindc
"
8508,2020-02-12,<senatemajldr>," yesterday, kentucky and the united states army received some great news. at my urging,  has been selected as the new headquarters for the army’s fifth corps. this is a big win for the army and for the bluegrass.  "
8509,2020-02-12,<senatemajldr>," #onthisday in 1809, kentucky native abraham lincoln was born. join me in celebrating the life of our 16th president.  "
8510,2020-02-11,<senatemajldr>," senate democrats spent years saying “when it comes to iran, we should never take the military option off the table.”  but now, after criticizing the successful strike on soleimani, they want to pass a resolution to limit president trump’s authorities.  "
8511,2020-02-11,<senatemajldr>, icymi 🎙️: this morning i joined  to discuss impeachment and judges. listen below for excerpts:  
8512,2020-02-11,<senatemajldr>, the state of our union is strong and there’s plenty for the senate to do to keep up this momentum for the american people.  we’ll start this week by confirming more of president trump’s well-qualified nominees to lifetime judicial appointments.  
8513,2020-02-10,<senatemajldr>," heavy rainfall last week damaged homes, businesses, &amp; infrastructure in southeastern kentucky. i’m grateful to the first responders who’ve helped many out of harm’s way. my team and i stand ready to work with local officials in the recovery process.  "
8514,2020-02-10,<senatemajldr>," the framers built the senate to be a firewall. we held the line. we fulfilled our constitutional duty, conducted a fair trial and delivered the outcome that president trump deserved.   read my new op-ed in the    "
8515,2020-02-05,<senatemajldr>," watch 📺: tonight at ~ 9:30pm et on  i’ll be joining  to discuss the conclusion of the impeachment trial.
"
8516,2020-02-05,<senatemajldr>," the architects of this impeachment claimed they were defending norms and traditions. in reality, it was an assault on both. they attacked due process, the office of the presidency, and the senate’s sole power to try impeachments.  "
8517,2020-02-05,<senatemajldr>," moments like this are what the senate was made for. the framers knew the country would need a firewall to keep partisan flames from scorching our republic.   so they created the senate. today, we will fulfill this founding purpose.
"
8518,2020-02-04,<senatemajldr>," for three years, republicans in congress have partnered with the president to keep america strong and safe and create record-setting prosperity for working families across the country. the results have been a truly all-american comeback. the state of our union is strong.  "
8519,2020-02-04,<senatemajldr>," tomorrow, the senate will put a stop to this reckless and partisan abuse of power by the house majority.  i urge every one of my colleagues to cast the vote that the facts in evidence, the constitution, &amp; the common good clearly require.  vote to acquit the president.  "
8520,2020-02-04,<senatemajldr>," the same democrats who want to take over everyone’s healthcare and micromanage the entire economy couldn’t even organize their own traditional iowa caucuses?
"
8521,2020-02-04,<senatemajldr>, washington democrats’ position on president trump has been obvious for three years: they believe he committed a “high crime [or] misdemeanor” the moment he defeated secretary clinton in the 2016 election.   that is the original sin of this presidency: that he won and they lost.  
8522,2020-02-04,<senatemajldr>," the framers knew that overheated house majorities might impeach on purely partisan grounds. but they knew that short-term passions could not get the final say. so they placed the ultimate judgment not in the fractious lower chamber, but in the sober and stable senate.  "
8523,2020-02-04,<senatemajldr>," at 9:30am, i will speak on the senate floor about the president’s impeachment trial and tomorrow’s conclusion to this process.  "
8524,2020-01-31,<senatemajldr>," a majority of the u.s. senate has determined that the numerous witnesses and 28,000-plus pages of documents already in evidence are sufficient to judge the house managers’ accusations and end this impeachment trial.   my full statement:  "
8525,2020-01-27,<senatemajldr>," 75 years ago today, the allies liberated auschwitz-birkenau. we must never forget the 6 million jewish people murdered by the nazis and the horrors of the holocaust. and we must renew our resolve to confront anti-semitism wherever it takes root. #holocaustremembranceday
"
8526,2020-01-24,<senatemajldr>, it was great to meet and thank kentuckians who traveled to washington for the march for life. washington needs your example and your advocacy more than ever. thank you for your moral courage.  my full statement:  
8527,2020-01-21,<senatemajldr>, there were good reasons why all 100 senators agreed two decades ago that the senate should not cross these bridges before we came to them. we will not let the architects of the unfair house process convince the senate to rewrite our rules just for president trump.  
8528,2020-01-21,<senatemajldr>, the way the senate decides to handle mid-trial questions such as witnesses could have institutional consequences that go far beyond this trial and this presidency. we are not going to rush into these questions without even hearing opening arguments.  
8529,2020-01-21,<senatemajldr>," it will be telling if the house managers try to get the senate to pre-commit ourselves to supplementing the investigation they themselves oversaw and decided to shut down. just last week, they said their case as it already exists is “overwhelming” and “beyond a reasonable doubt.”  "
8530,2020-01-21,<senatemajldr>," in 1999, the senate unanimously agreed on a basic trial structure that was fair to all parties. today, we must rise to the occasion and preserve that bipartisan precedent. our resolution sets up the same basic steps. fair is fair.  "
8531,2020-01-20,<senatemajldr>," today we celebrate the life and legacy of one of america’s greatest heroes. dr. king’s strength and heroism made our country stronger and more just. by sharing his dream, he awoke a nation.  "
8532,2020-01-16,<senatemajldr>," ‘this body, this chamber, exists precisely so that we can look past daily dramas and understand how our actions will reverberate for generations. the house’s hour is over. the senate’s time is at hand. it is time for this proud body to honor our founding purpose.’  "
8533,2020-01-16,<senatemajldr>, breaking: the senate just passed the usmca. next stop:  desk for his signature.  i’m grateful to the president for prioritizing this deal and delivering on this major promise. it’s a big win for kentucky and for american families in all 50 states.  
8534,2020-01-16,<senatemajldr>," yesterday, the speaker celebrated impeachment with souvenir pens, bearing her own golden signature, brought in on silver platters. the house’s partisan process distilled into one last perfect visual. not solemn or serious. a transparently political exercise from beginning to end.  "
8535,2020-01-15,<senatemajldr>," the framers built the senate to break these kinds of partisan fevers. to stabilize our institutions and protect our country. to stop short-term passions from destroying our long-term future. that is the senate's duty. that is what we must do when this trial begins.
"
8536,2020-01-15,<senatemajldr>," democrats’ impeachment has been nakedly partisan from the beginning. pelosi admits it was in the making years before events with ukraine. schumer says that whatever happens, if it helps him politically, it’s a “win-win.” they are playing political games with the constitution.
"
8537,2020-01-15,<senatemajldr>," these two things cannot both be true. is house democrats’ case so “overwhelming” that it was enough to impeach a president? or is their case so weak and incomplete that they need the senate to redo it? they can’t even stick to one story.
"
8538,2020-01-15,<senatemajldr>," even today, the speaker and her allies keep contradicting themselves. they say their case is already “overwhelming,” “beyond any reasonable doubt.” but they also keep asking the senate to re-do their homework and add to the investigation that house democrats rushed to close.
"
8539,2020-01-15,<senatemajldr>," it looks like today’s the day. house democrats may finally stand behind the rushed, unfair, and nakedly partisan impeachment that they themselves delayed for four weeks. the ‘prosecutors’ have finally overcome their cold feet.
"
8540,2020-01-14,<senatemajldr>," it’s clear democrats see impeachment as one big political game. sen. schumer told reporters that as long as the process hurts republicans, “it’s a win-win.” the country deserves better. we’re overdue for some seriousness and sober judgment. that is what the senate will bring.  "
8541,2020-01-14,<senatemajldr>," we’ve reached a simple contradiction. the house case cannot be so robust that it was enough to rush into impeachment, and enough for senate democrats to start pre-judging guilt, but also so weak that they need the senate to go fishing. these two stories cannot both be true.  "
8542,2020-01-14,<senatemajldr>," first, democrats spent weeks saying the house case was totally convincing. now, the opposite: they say the house case is so thin that if the senate judges what the house actually voted on, it's a “cover-up.""  their own investigation was so shallow that it now equals a “cover-up”?  "
8543,2020-01-14,<senatemajldr>," in december, house democrats pulled the plug on their investigation and impeached because they said it was urgent &amp; they had already proven their case. but now they’ve delayed for weeks to insist that the senate re-open their inquiry.  so – neither urgent nor persuasive?
"
8544,2020-01-13,<senatemajldr>, it should not take brave iranians to remind american leaders that tehran has been a force for bad and the united states is a force for good. i hope this can be a lesson to those who’ve let domestic political grievances pollute their judgment.  
8545,2020-01-13,<senatemajldr>," if house democrats were confident their own investigation was persuasive, they would not be so desperate to get the senate to reopen it. the house has signaled they're afraid for the senate to judge the case they will actually send us. the case they voted for.  "
8546,2020-01-13,<senatemajldr>, i’m glad the speaker may finally be realizing she never had any “leverage” to dictate senate procedure to senators. the senate was never going to pre-commit ourselves to redoing the prosecutors’ homework for them.  
8547,2020-01-09,<senatemajldr>," today is #nationallawenforcementappreciationday and i wanted to take a moment and honor all law enforcement officers, especially our kentuckians in uniform and their families. thank you for your service.  "
8548,2020-01-09,<senatemajldr>," this is a challenging time to create bipartisan agreement. but the speaker pelosi has managed to do the impossible. she has created growing bipartisan unity — in opposition to her own reckless games with impeachment.
"
8549,2020-01-08,<senatemajldr>," a majority of the senate has decided that the first phase of an impeachment trial should track closely with the unanimous bipartisan precedent that all 100 senators supported for the first phase of the clinton trial in 1999.
"
8550,2020-01-08,<senatemajldr>," there will be no haggling with the house over senate procedure. we will not cede our authority to try this impeachment. the house democrats’ turn is over. the senate has made its decision. this is for the senate, and the senate only, to decide.
"
8551,2020-01-08,<senatemajldr>, i agree with  the united states does not seek conflict but is prepared to protect american lives and interests. iran should not question our collective will by launching further attacks.  my full remarks:  
8552,2020-01-07,<senatemajldr>," it’s almost as though this house democrat majority systematically took all of the framers’ warnings about partisan abuses of the impeachment power &amp; thought, “sure, let’s do that.”   the american people deserve better.  "
8553,2020-01-07,<senatemajldr>," i respect my friends across the aisle, but it appears that one symptom of “trump derangement syndrome” is a bad case of amnesia.
"
8554,2020-01-07,<senatemajldr>, how embarrassing and revealing for house democrats to spend weeks telling the american people their partisan impeachment was so very urgent — and then delay it for political purposes.  
8555,2020-01-06,<senatemajldr>," in the senate, overheated partisan passions are supposed to give way to sober judgment. can we not wait until we know the facts? can we not maintain a shred of unity for five minutes before deepening partisan fights? we are all americans first and we are all in this together.
"
8556,2020-01-06,<senatemajldr>," it was sad to see some senate democrats rush to blame our own administration before even knowing the facts. rush to split hairs about intelligence before being briefed on it. rush to downplay soleimani’s evil while presenting our own president as the villain.
"
8557,2020-01-06,<senatemajldr>," i’m glad that the administration will hold an all-senators briefing on wednesday on recent events with iran. it will be led by secretary of defense esper, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general milley, secretary of state pompeo, and cia director haspel.
"
8558,2020-01-06,<senatemajldr>, they should not disdain our constitution by rushing through a purely partisan impeachment process and then toying around with it.  governing is serious business. the american people deserve better than this.  
8559,2020-01-06,<senatemajldr>," house democrats continue to play political games with their partisan impeachment of the commander-in-chief. even with a process this constitutionally serious, even with tensions rising in the middle east, house democrats are treating impeachment like a political toy.  "
8560,2020-01-06,<senatemajldr>, the senate’s unanimous bipartisan precedent from 1999 left witnesses &amp; other mid-trial questions to the middle of the trial. house democrats may have scrapped their own precedents to hurt president trump but they do not call the shots in the senate.  
8561,2020-01-03,<senatemajldr>," we can’t hold a trial without the articles. the senate’s own rules don’t provide for that. so, for now, we are content to continue the ordinary business of the senate while house democrats continue to flounder. for now.
"
8562,2020-01-03,<senatemajldr>," if the house ever musters the courage to stand behind their slapdash work product and transmit their impeachment to the senate, it will be time for the united states senate to fulfill our founding purpose.
"
