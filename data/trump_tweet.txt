1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!
1328094310294822917 2020-11-15 13:55:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Spirit like never before!
1328094121295286273 2020-11-15 13:54:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Amazing!
1328093294782509060 2020-11-15 13:51:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We won’t let a RIGGED ELECTION steal our Country!
1328089401008807943 2020-11-15 13:36:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> WATCH: D.C. Cops Direct Trump-Supporters into Gauntlet of Protesters, Do Nothing When They Are Assaulted  https://t.co/179yDCbZou via @BreitbartNews. These thugs and lowlifes only stalked and attacked when most of the tens of thousands of people had left town. Ran away earlier!
1328057941203836930 2020-11-15 11:31:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great job Emily!
1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327989713786036227 2020-11-15 06:59:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Rudy will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo at 10:00 A.M. NOW!
1327988661418340353 2020-11-15 06:55:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Progress!
1327979630477922304 2020-11-15 06:19:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327840088731029504 2020-11-14 21:05:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mark, but the Fake News Media will never say it!
1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!
1327836670742450177 2020-11-14 20:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Media is the Enemy of the People!!!
1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS! Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, a truly great team, added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives!
1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!

1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat.

1327438487537246210 2020-11-13 18:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!

1327350069947936768 2020-11-13 12:38:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Now it is learned that the horrendous Dominion Voting System was used in Arizona (and big in Nevada). No wonder the result was a very close loss!
1327319294057848832 2020-11-13 10:35:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Heartwarming to see all of the tremendous support out there, especially the organic Rallies that are springing up all over the Country, including a big one on Saturday in D.C. I may even try to stop by and say hello. This Election was Rigged, from Dominion all the way up &amp; down!
1327279929319432200 2020-11-13 07:59:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> For years the Dems have been preaching how unsafe and rigged our elections have been.

Very sad to watch this happen, but they forgot what made them successful, what got them there. They forgot the Golden Goose. The biggest difference between the 2016 Election, and 2020, was @FoxNews!

1326343694912466944 2020-11-10 17:59:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> That’s why Mike was number one in his class at West Point!
1326342742801326083 2020-11-10 17:55:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Andrew McCabe was exposed for who he is today in the U.S. Senate. He was totally destroyed - an ignorant fool. The great people of the FBI must make sure that he and his former boss, James Comey, pay the price for what they have done to the reputation of the FBI.

1326194143132082178 2020-11-10 08:04:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Republicans, don’t let Andrew McCabe continue to get away with totally criminal activity. What he did should never be allowed to happen to our Country again. FIGHT FOR JUSTICE!

1325961672343875585 2020-11-09 16:41:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If Joe Biden were President, you wouldn’t have the Vaccine for another four years, nor would the @US_FDA have ever approved it so quickly. The bureaucracy would have destroyed millions of lives!
1325961445062938625 2020-11-09 16:40:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> As I have long said, @Pfizer and the others would only announce a Vaccine after the Election, because they didn’t have the courage to do it before. Likewise, the @US_FDA should have announced it earlier, not for political purposes, but for saving lives!

1324108206801563650 2020-11-04 13:56:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .....there was a large number of secretly dumped ballots as has been widely reported!
1324108200141082624 2020-11-04 13:56:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We have claimed, for Electoral Vote purposes, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (which won’t allow legal observers) the State of Georgia, and the State of North Carolina, each one of which has a BIG Trump lead. Additionally, we hereby claim the State of Michigan if, in fact,.....
1324061986779504642 2020-11-04 10:52:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We are winning Pennsylvania big, but the PA Secretary of State just announced that there are “Millions of ballots left to be counted.”
1324059767581671425 2020-11-04 10:43:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! It looks like Michigan has now found the ballots necessary to keep a wonderful young man, John James, out of the U.S. Senate. What a terrible thing is happening!
1324033983882166272 2020-11-04 09:01:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They are working hard to make up 500,000 vote advantage in Pennsylvania disappear — ASAP. Likewise, Michigan and others!
1324032541544927233 2020-11-04 08:55:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They are finding Biden votes all over the place — in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. So bad for our Country!
1324012341458075648 2020-11-04 07:35:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?
1324007806694023169 2020-11-04 07:17:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> How come every time they count Mail-In ballot dumps they are so devastating in their percentage and power of destruction?
1324004491612618752 2020-11-04 07:04:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Last night I was leading, often solidly, in many key States, in almost all instances Democrat run &amp; controlled. Then, one by one, they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted. VERY STRANGE, and the “pollsters” got it completely &amp; historically wrong!
1323864823680126977 2020-11-03 21:49:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!
1323864021167198209 2020-11-03 21:45:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will be making a statement tonight. A big WIN!
1323765884268224514 2020-11-03 15:15:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> WE ARE LOOKING REALLY GOOD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU!

1323481349030879232 2020-11-02 20:25:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Our prayers are with the people of Vienna after yet another vile act of terrorism in Europe. These evil attacks against innocent people must stop. The U.S. stands with Austria, France, and all of Europe in the fight against terrorists, including radical Islamic terrorists.

1323470806240927745 2020-11-02 19:43:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden has vowed to ABOLISH the American oil and natural gas industries, and BAN fracking.

1323430341512622080 2020-11-02 17:02:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Supreme Court decision on voting in Pennsylvania is a VERY dangerous one. It will allow rampant and unchecked cheating and will undermine our entire systems of laws. It will also induce violence in the streets. Something must be done!

1323425208255086592 2020-11-02 16:42:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> For 47 years, Joe Biden viciously attacked Black Americans. He called young black men “super predators.” To every black American: I am asking for your vote. This is your one and only chance to show Sleepy Joe what you think of his decision to attack you, jail you, and betray you!
1323424836077670400 2020-11-02 16:40:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden would increase refugees from terrorist nations by 700%. His plan would overwhelm your communities and turn Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin and the entire Midwest into a refugee camp. I am protecting your families and keeping Radical Islamic Terrorists OUT of our Country!
1323424722911170560 2020-11-02 16:40:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A vote for Joe Biden is a vote to extinguish and eradicate your state’s auto industry.

1323335185035747330 2020-11-02 10:44:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden NEVER named his list of Supreme Court Justices. Never even said whether or not he was going to Pack the Court. So how do you vote for this guy?

1323326204384964608 2020-11-02 10:08:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden was a pathetic laughing stock all over Washington for the horrible way he handled the H1N1 Swine Flu. Even his own Chief of Staff said he didn’t know what he was doing!

1323143751250907136 2020-11-01 22:03:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> For 47 years, Sleepy Joe Biden betrayed Hispanic-Americans.

1323116444201164802 2020-11-01 20:15:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who is bought and paid for by China!

1323072051402350592 2020-11-01 17:18:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In my opinion, these patriots did nothing wrong. Instead, the FBI &amp; Justice should be investigating the terrorists, anarchists, and agitators of ANTIFA, who run around burning down our Democrat run cities and hurting our people!

1323030938952060928 2020-11-01 14:35:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden is the candidate of rioters, looters, arsonists, gun-grabbers, flag-burners, Marxists, lobbyists, and special interests. I am the candidate of farmers, factory workers, police officers, and hard-working, law-abiding patriots of every race, religion and creed! #MAGA
1323030825072472065 2020-11-01 14:35:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden will terminate school choice, eliminate charter schools, defund religious schools, ban prayer in public schools, indoctrinate your children with Anti-American lies, and force you to subsidize extreme late-term abortion. We believe that every child is a Sacred Gift from God!
1323030714330292226 2020-11-01 14:34:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> For decades, Joe Biden let other countries rip you off and cheat America blind! The only people who’ve benefited from his policies are himself &amp; his family. He shows up every 4 years, and then goes back to D.C. and caters to his special interests. My only special interest is YOU.

1323021747248005120 2020-11-01 13:58:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Pennsylvania: Biden said that he doesn’t want Fracking. Besides, and more importantly, his handlers won’t allow Fracking. That would be the end of Pennsylvania!
1323020254054789120 2020-11-01 13:53:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden did a very POOR job of handling H1N1 Swine Flu, yet all he talks about is Covid, Covid, Covid, like he would actually know what he is doing. He doesn’t. Plus, he would be TERRIBLE with the Economy!

1322899819661303808 2020-11-01 05:54:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The legendary actor, 007 Sean Connery, has past on to even greener fairways. He was quite a guy, and a tough character.

1322892481751646212 2020-11-01 05:25:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden wants to LOCKDOWN our Country, maybe for years. Crazy! There will be NO LOCKDOWNS. The great American Comeback is underway!!!
1322885492933799936 2020-11-01 04:57:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden called Black Youth SUPER PREDATORS. They will NEVER like him, or vote for him. They are voting for “TRUMP”.

Plants were closing and moving to Mexico, and other places. No new plants for decades. I stopped the moves, &amp; now many plants are and have been built...
1322864490929627140 2020-11-01 03:34:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Our numbers are looking VERY good all over. Sleepy Joe is already beginning to pull out of certain states. The Radical Left is going down!
1322862672287830017 2020-11-01 03:26:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People have long been voting but Joe Biden has still not released his Supreme Court List of Radical Left Judges that he would like to put on the Court. Also, is he going to Court Pack? He thinks he can bluff his way through these two important questions. Can only vote against!!!

1322616235423539200 2020-10-31 12:07:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden &amp; Obama owe a massive apology to the People of Flint. The water was poisoned on their watch.

1322613905001226240 2020-10-31 11:58:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden’s plan to Abolish American Energy is an economic DEATH SENTENCE for Pennsylvania.

1322334801374834688 2020-10-30 17:29:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who has done nothing but betray you for 47 long years - selling out to lobbyists, China, big pharma &amp; foreign countries.

1322325248927150082 2020-10-30 16:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> President Obama used to say that “if you wanted to see something really screwed up, give it to Joe Biden to do.” In fact, he tried to keep Joe from running, “you don’t have to do this Joe”, and then wouldn’t endorse him until long after the Primaries ended. “Joe is lost!”.

1322170415700152320 2020-10-30 06:36:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I would NEVER have taken the endorsement of the man who, through gross incompetence, poisoned the people of Flint, Michigan.

1321966078638100480 2020-10-29 17:04:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News refuses to cover the fact that GDP went up 33.1% for the 3rd Quarter, the best number by far in our Country’s history!
1321961340341121025 2020-10-29 16:45:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> My Administration has suspended the entry of refugees from terror-compromised nations such as Syria, Somalia and Yemen. Biden’s plan surges refugees 700% into Minnesota, Michigan &amp; Pennsylvania—burdening schools &amp; hospitals while opening the floodgates to Radical Islamic Terror.
1321958690379821056 2020-10-29 16:34:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Failed RINO former Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan was a disaster with respect to the Flint Water CATASTROPHE, and a very bad Governor overall. He hurt so many people with his gross incompetence. He reminds me of Sleepy Joe!

1321858569466114048 2020-10-29 09:56:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So it turns out that the wise guy promoted as “Anonymous” by the @nytimes, named Miles Taylor (who I never even heard of!), was only a little known “staffer” as opposed to a “Senior Administration Official”. He then scammed @CNN, lied to @andersoncooper, &amp; got a job there....

1321812933135994881 2020-10-29 06:55:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> GDP number just announced. Biggest and Best in the History of our Country, and not even close. Next year will be FANTASTIC!!! However, Sleepy Joe Biden and his proposed record setting tax increase, would kill it all. So glad this great GDP number came out before November 3rd.

1321596126001197056 2020-10-28 16:34:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why isn’t Biden corruption trending number one on Twitter? Biggest world story, and nowhere to be found. There is no”trend”, only negative stories that Twitter wants to put up. Disgraceful! Section 230
1321595603734814720 2020-10-28 16:32:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for the biggest TAX HIKE in history, crushing regulations, slashing Medicare and Social Security, and abolishing American Energy.

1321525645386547203 2020-10-28 11:54:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why isn’t Twitter trending Biden corruption? It’s the biggest, and most credible, story anywhere in the world. Fake Trending!!!
1321491143457042433 2020-10-28 09:36:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Media and Big Tech are not covering Biden Corruption!
1321490288204935168 2020-10-28 09:33:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The USA doesn’t have Freedom of the Press, we have Suppression of the Story, or just plain Fake News. So much has been learned in the last two weeks about how corrupt our Media is, and now Big Tech, maybe even worse. Repeal Section 230!

1321472358830403585 2020-10-28 08:22:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> It’s amazing. Twitter refuses to allow the any mention of the Biden corruption story which was carried so well on @TuckerCarlson last night. It’s the biggest story and Big Tech, together with the Lamestream Media, isn’t allowing a word to be said about it.

1321430459050381313 2020-10-28 05:35:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Covid, Covid, Covid is the unified chant of the Fake News Lamestream Media. They will talk about nothing else until November 4th., when the Election will be (hopefully!) over. Then the talk will be how low the death rate is, plenty of hospital rooms, &amp; many tests of young people.

1321153609321443330 2020-10-27 11:15:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> 3 Points up in Michigan, 2 Points up in Wisconsin, 3 Points up in Pennsylvania. The Great Red Wave is forming, and getting ready to VOTE!
1321151327448133633 2020-10-27 11:06:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden FAILED BADLY with the Swine Flu Epidemic. He knows nothing. All talk and no action!

1321144951430729728 2020-10-27 10:41:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Lufkin, Texas — someone was stealing Trump signs, so an anonymous tree climber put up 30 of them throughout the community. Love it, thank you! #MAGA  https://t.co/Ixx7iBxiYM
1321126626298634240 2020-10-27 09:28:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Now @FoxNews is playing Obama’s no crowd, fake speech for Biden, a man he could barely endorse because he couldn’t believe he won. Also, I PREPAID many Millions of Dollars in Taxes.
1321121036142841856 2020-10-27 09:06:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Michigan—leaving the White House shortly, see you soon!  https://t.co/I6VHSgKMSB
1321113340928839681 2020-10-27 08:35:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They (his handlers) ripped Sleepy Joe off the stage yesterday when he got lost in a “mental fog”. A disaster. Very little reporting on this!
1321111457434619906 2020-10-27 08:28:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you to the Boston Herald. A great honor!
1321110707937648641 2020-10-27 08:25:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The biggest difference between now and 2016 is @FoxNews. They are a whole different deal. Despite this, our campaign is doing much better, with bigger crowds and even more (much!) enthusiasm, than we had in 2016. Big Debate &amp; SCOTUS Win! Real Polls have us winning everywhere!
1321107640651550720 2020-10-27 08:13:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Obama is drawing VERY small (tiny) numbers of people. Biden is drawing almost no one. We are drawing tens of thousands of people. You’ll see that again today. The Great Red Wave is coming!!!
1321103651000254464 2020-10-27 07:57:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Death rate of people going into hospitals is MUCH LOWER now than it was. @MSNBC  Wow, MSDNC has come a long way! The fact is that we have learned and done a lot about this Virus. Much different now than when it first arrived on our shores, and the World’s, from China!
1321091050488909824 2020-10-27 07:07:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you very much to the great @WashTimes for the wonderful Endorsement of the job I have done as President. “His record of achievement in his first term is unmatched by any president in modern times. A second term is likely to bring more successes and a stronger America.”

1321070015500722177 2020-10-27 05:43:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Claudia Tenney is GREAT. Loves New York &amp; USA. She has my Full &amp; Complete Endorsement! VOTE
1321069161917915140 2020-10-27 05:40:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Rose is a disaster for New York. Not listened to, or respected, in Washington. A puppet for Pelosi!

1321051933654863872 2020-10-27 04:31:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ALL THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IS COVID, COVID, COVID. ON NOVEMBER 4th, YOU WON’T BE HEARING SO MUCH ABOUT IT ANYMORE. WE ARE ROUNDING THE TURN!!!
1321050802371334145 2020-10-27 04:27:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Philadelpiha MUST HAVE POLLWATCHERS!
1321046029781864452 2020-10-27 04:08:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I agree!
1321045863301586945 2020-10-27 04:07:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden’s Handler’s want to expand the Court. This would be very bad for the USA. On top of that they don’t want to provide a list of who would be chosen for the Court. MUST HAVE A LIST OF THESE RADICAL LEFT JUDGES!
1321042229838909441 2020-10-27 03:53:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Strongly Trending (Google) since immediately after the second debate is CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE? This refers changing it to me. The answer in most states is YES. Go do it. Most important Election of your life!

1320817236106330112 2020-10-26 12:59:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Last week, Joe Biden made perhaps the most shocking admission ever uttered in the history of presidential debates. On live television, Joe Biden confirmed his plan to ABOLISH the entire U.S. Oil Industry—that means NO fracking, NO jobs, and NO energy for Pennsylvania Families!

1320711322284281862 2020-10-26 05:58:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media is riding COVID, COVID, COVID, all the way to the Election. Losers!

1320690788628598784 2020-10-26 04:36:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We have made tremendous progress with the China Virus, but the Fake News refuses to talk about it this close to the Election. COVID, COVID, COVID is being used by them, in total coordination, in order to change our great early election numbers.Should be an election law violation!
1320689314506964997 2020-10-26 04:30:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden called me George yesterday. Couldn’t remember my name. Got some help from the anchor to get him through the interview. The Fake News Cartel is working overtime to cover it up!
1320585745032269825 2020-10-25 21:39:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “A Pennsylvania Appeals Court turns down the Trump Administrations request for Poll Watchers to monitor satellite election offices.” @OANN  How terrible is this? We are just seeking a fair vote count. This can only lead to very bad things. Bad intentions much??? Disgraceful!!!
1320506563711410177 2020-10-25 16:24:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and others, please watch. His party, and Joe, will stop Fracking immediately. Millions of jobs lost as energy prices soar. Vote Trump!

1320345820819050499 2020-10-25 05:45:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Pennsylvania Ballot “mistakes” made, in my opinion, on purpose by the Democrat Governor, puts Republicans, in particular @SeanParnellUSA, at great risk. Corrupt politics in Pennsylvania must be investigated immediately. By the way, Philadelphia is out of control. @TheJusticeDept
1320336553609232384 2020-10-25 05:08:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So important to VOTE for Republicans in the House. Break away from Pelosi and her high Taxing new Radical Left friends. Protect your 2nd Amendment, Military, Vets, and sooo much more!
1320334845520863233 2020-10-25 05:02:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@SeanParnellUSA is a bright star for Pennsylvania. Military, Vets, Low Taxes and your 2nd Amendment will be totally protected. His opponent is a weak and ineffective puppet for Pelosi and her new Radical Left friends. Vote for Sean Parnell!

1319719469552340993 2020-10-23 12:16:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden’s response to the H1N1 Swine Flu, far less lethal than Covid 19, was one of the weakest and worst in the history of fighting epidemics and pandemics. It was pathetic, those involved have said. Joe didn’t have a clue!
1319711635808735233 2020-10-23 11:45:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden said he is going to “transition out of (fracking) by 2025”. I hope Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and all of the rest were listening last night. High energy prices, massive jobs losses! Vote Trump.
1319710299419623424 2020-10-23 11:40:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden was very disrespectful to President Obama at last night’s debate when he said that he, Joe, “was Vice President, not President,” when trying to make excuses for their failed immigration policies. I wonder what “O” was thinking when he heard that one?

1319305244967378944 2020-10-22 08:50:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden wants to Pack the Court with Radical Left crazies. He doesn’t even want to make a list to explain who they are. Can’t let this happen!
1319300515478622218 2020-10-22 08:32:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Finally! Suburban women are flocking over to us. They realize that I am saving the Suburbs - the American Dream! I terminated the Regulation that would bring projects and crime to Suburbia. Not on my watch! Biden will bring the Regulation back, but bigger and worse.
1319299079264940039 2020-10-22 08:26:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Obama is campaigning for us. Every time he speaks, people come over to our side. He didn’t even want to endorse Sleepy Joe. Did so long after primaries were over!

1318924531092828162 2020-10-21 07:38:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Your 401k’s will crash with Biden. Massive Biden Tax and Regulation increases will destroy all that you have built! Additionally, 180 Million People will lose their Private Healthcare Plans.
1318898380421083137 2020-10-21 05:54:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Remember, BIDEN is going to raise your taxes at a level never seen before. This will not only be very costly for you, it will destroy our economy, which is coming back very rapidly.

1318270345162354688 2020-10-19 12:18:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A perfect strike for the American people!
1318267922112942080 2020-10-19 12:08:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....Washington wants nothing to do with him, and that’s so bad for New York, which has become a ghost town. Andrew spends too much time listening to his brother, Fredo. Forget the books and your apology tour. The Federal Government would love to help New York regain its luster!
1318267921227943936 2020-10-19 12:08:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Governor Cuomo has shown tremendously poor leadership skills in running N.Y. Bad time for him to be writing and promoting a book, especially since he has done such a poor job with Covid and Crime. So many unnecessary deaths. The City &amp; State have sunk to historic lows...
1318252740431155200 2020-10-19 11:08:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...P.S. Tony should stop wearing the Washington Nationals’ Mask for two reasons. Number one, it is not up to the high standards that he should be exposing. Number two, it keeps reminding me that Tony threw out perhaps the worst first pitch in the history of Baseball!
1318252736538767360 2020-10-19 11:08:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Dr.Tony Fauci says we don’t allow him to do television, and yet I saw him last night on @60Minutes, and he seems to get more airtime than anybody since the late, great, Bob Hope. All I ask of Tony is that he make better decisions. He said “no masks &amp; let China in”. Also, Bad arm!
1318251010595303424 2020-10-19 11:01:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> GREAT news! New government of Sudan, which is making great progress, agreed to pay $335 MILLION to U.S. terror victims and families. Once deposited, I will lift Sudan from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. At long last, JUSTICE for the American people and BIG step for Sudan!

1318242345423269889 2020-10-19 10:27:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....There has never been more enthusiasm or spirit, by everyone. Great fun, and so good for our Country. Already winning many states, but not reported. Biden put the LID on again - raising money with promises. They finally caught him, COLD, and he knows it. Laptop is devastating!

1317891781648773121 2020-10-18 11:14:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Corrupt politician Joe Biden makes Crooked Hillary look like an amateur!
1317861704819118080 2020-10-18 09:14:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Not my Wall, which will soon be finished (and Mexico will pay for the Wall!). Totally unrelated, but I think Steve will be just fine. By the way, is this the same job hopping Tim O’Brien that headed Mini Mike Bloomberg’s humiliating 2 Billion Dollar Presidential run? Debate prep!
1317858680461668352 2020-10-18 09:02:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Very proud of the @nypost, my former “hometown newspaper”. They have said and shown what everyone knows about Sleepy Joe Biden. He is a CORRUPT POLITICIAN!!!
1317852810302558208 2020-10-18 08:39:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden is a corrupt politician, and everybody knows it. Now you have the proof, perhaps like never was had before on a major politician. Laptop plus. This is the second biggest political scandal in our history!
1317825484495880192 2020-10-18 06:50:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hunter Biden’s laptop is a disaster for the entire Biden family, but especially for his father, Joe. It is now a proven fact, and cannot be denied, that all of that info is the REAL DEAL. That makes it impossible for “50%, or 10%” Joe, to ever assume the office of the President!
1317822838519128068 2020-10-18 06:40:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The United States shows more CASES than other countries, which the Lamestream Fake News Media pounces on daily, because it TESTS at such a high (and costly) level. No country in the world tests at this level. The more you TEST, the more CASES you will be reporting. Very simple!
1317692654809796608 2020-10-17 22:03:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John, thank you. Such a great honor!

1317652898910674945 2020-10-17 19:25:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...while sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician — and the Biden family is a criminal enterprise. This makes Crooked Hillary Clinton look like amateur hour!
1317652894678609921 2020-10-17 19:25:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden is the living embodiment of the corrupt political class that enriched itself while draining the economic life and soul from our Country. For the last 47 years, Joe Biden shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your borders, and ravaged our cities...
1317651520763031554 2020-10-17 19:19:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This election is a choice between a TRUMP RECOVERY and a BIDEN DEPRESSION.

1317496034034057216 2020-10-17 09:01:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> GIANT RED WAVE COMING!
1317495725786353670 2020-10-17 09:00:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....practically nothing. Both Senators became totally unelectable, couldn’t come even close to winning their primaries, and decided to drop out of politics and gracefully “RETIRE”. @SenSasse could be next, or perhaps the Republicans should find a new and more viable candidate?
1317495722133065728 2020-10-17 09:00:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Senator Little Ben Sasse of the Great State of Nebraska seems to be heading down the same inglorious path as former Senators Liddle’ Bob Corker, whose approval rating in Tennessee went from 55% to 4%, &amp; Jeff “the Flake” Flake, whose approval rating in Arizona went from 56% to....
1317460179223498753 2020-10-17 06:39:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...Nomination to run for a second term. Then he went back to his rather stupid and obnoxious ways. Must feel he can’t lose to a Dem. Little Ben is a liability to the Republican Party, and an embarrassment to the Great State of Nebraska. Other than that, he’s just a wonderful guy!
1317460178246291462 2020-10-17 06:39:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The least effective of our 53 Republican Senators, and a person who truly doesn’t have what it takes to be great, is Little Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a State which I have gladly done so much to help. @SenSasse was as nice as a RINO can be until he recently won the Republican....

1317225324623532032 2020-10-16 15:06:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU OCALA, FLORIDA!  https://t.co/w6KmVYR6kA
1317199596649541633 2020-10-16 13:23:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Getting ready to speak in Florida. Enjoy!
1317140754733543424 2020-10-16 09:30:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden made another big mistake. He totally mixed up two Crime Bills. Didn’t have a clue (as usual!). Also, he freely used the term SUPER PREDATOR!!!
1317136710141136898 2020-10-16 09:13:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump>  https://t.co/10v8v4mVgO
1317081982166323200 2020-10-16 05:36:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is a nasty rumor out there that @SenatorCollins of Maine will not be supporting our great United States Supreme Court Nominee. Well, she didn’t support Healthcare or my opening up 5000 square miles of Ocean to Maine, so why should this be any different. Not worth the work!
1317078386225893378 2020-10-16 05:22:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big T was not a reference to me, but rather to Big Tech, which should have been properly pointed out in Twitter’s Fake Trending Section!
1317076736555819008 2020-10-16 05:15:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Steve Scully of @cspan had a very bad week. When his name was announced, I said he would not be appropriate because of conflicts. I was right! Then he said he was hacked, he wasn’t. I was right again! But his biggest mistake was “confiding” in a lowlife loser like the Mooch. Sad!
1317065042706268162 2020-10-16 04:29:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Very good reviews on last night’s @NBCNews Town Hall in Miami. Thank you!!!
1317063921375842305 2020-10-16 04:24:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Polls numbers are looking very strong. Big crowds, great enthusiasm. Massive RED WAVE coming!!!
1317062178265026562 2020-10-16 04:17:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden lied Pennsylvania!
1317060388371025922 2020-10-16 04:10:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you!
1317057909927325700 2020-10-16 04:00:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you LIBERTARIANS. We are getting it all done, and FAST! VOTE TRUMP!!!
1317056951986098176 2020-10-16 03:57:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The process has long begun. Happening fast!
1317056094548774914 2020-10-16 03:53:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great!
1317053924096999426 2020-10-16 03:44:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Sleepy Joe Biden had a very bad showing last night, despite the fact that @GStephanopoulos didn’t ask him any questions on his being a “corrupt politician”. Big Tech &amp; Lamestream Media are working hard to hide this corruption!!!
1317049630023090177 2020-10-16 03:27:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Ammar is a puppet for Nancy Pelosi and the Radical Left. He spells higher taxes, weak Military and Vet support, and the obliteration of your 2nd Amendment. Vote Darrell Issa!
1317047940473626624 2020-10-16 03:21:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Darrell is great. He has my Complete and Total Endorsement. He will Never let you down. WARRIOR!!!!
1317046789049122816 2020-10-16 03:16:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Jason wrote a new book. It is fantastic. Order it Now, make Jason #1- He deserves it!!!
1317044734989402112 2020-10-16 03:08:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you!
1317044556328730625 2020-10-16 03:07:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Twitter Shuts Down Entire Network To Slow Spread Of Negative Biden News  https://t.co/JPmjOrKPcr via @TheBabylonBee Wow, this has never been done in history. This includes his really bad interview last night. Why is Twitter doing this. Bringing more attention to Sleepy Joe &amp; Big T
1316842581985173504 2020-10-15 13:45:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU NORTH CAROLINA!  https://t.co/4epZQPjfi7
1316841775466651648 2020-10-15 13:41:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Pelosi is holding up STIMULUS, not the Republicans!
1316839129833902080 2020-10-15 13:31:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will be doing a major Fake @NBCNews Town Hall Forum, live tonight from Miami, at 8:00 P.M. They asked me to do it in place of the Rigged Steve Scully (he is now suspended from @cspan for lying) Debate. I wonder if they’ll treat me as well as Sleepy Joe? They should!
1316829885147480064 2020-10-15 12:54:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I was right again! Steve Scully just admitted he was lying about his Twitter being hacked. The Debate was Rigged! He was suspended from @cspan indefinitely. The Trump Campaign was not treated fairly by the “Commission”. Did I show good instincts in being the first to know?
1316823238958149632 2020-10-15 12:28:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If we don’t win, the Radical Left will destroy our Country. Biden refuses to answer questions on packing the SCOTUS! Dems will pack the Court w/ radical left justices who will shred the #2A, empower violent mobs, and protect terrorists &amp; violent criminals!  https://t.co/qUrjRM6MTp
1316822302533668864 2020-10-15 12:24:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden and the Democrat Socialists will kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments, dissolve your borders, release criminal aliens, raise your taxes, confiscate your guns, end fracking, destroy your suburbs, and drive God from the public square.  https://t.co/vrjMVaZhDI
1316821530769149952 2020-10-15 12:21:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If Big Tech persists, in coordination with the mainstream media, we must immediately strip them of their Section 230 protections. When government granted these protections, they created a monster!  https://t.co/velyvYTOR0
1316821231648215040 2020-10-15 12:20:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> It was great to be back in North Carolina with thousands of loyal, hardworking American Patriots! This election is a simple choice: If Biden Wins, China Wins. When WE Win, YOU WIN, North Carolina WINS, and America WINS!  https://t.co/jWYVYZdT3E

1316599114549866497 2020-10-14 21:37:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> VOTE TRUMP. SAVE YOUR 2ND. AMENDMENT.
1316598194894233601 2020-10-14 21:34:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Nancy Pelosi couldn’t care less about the American People or the great American Worker. She should approve needed STIMULUS now. Most other Dems agree. Republicans are ready to go, I am ready to sign!!!
1316596552757063680 2020-10-14 21:27:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are fleeing California. Taxes too high, Crime too high, Brownouts too many, Lockdowns too severe. VOTE FOR TRUMP, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE!!!

1316587911349927936 2020-10-14 20:53:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I’ve gone through years of a Fake, Illegal, and Totally Discredited Witch-Hunt, and now it’s revealed that it was a Hoax by the “other side”, which must pay a price for what they did. Think of where we’d be now without Fake &amp; Fraudulent stories every night, for years!!!

1316558554732531713 2020-10-14 18:56:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden must immediately release all emails, meetings, phone calls, transcripts, and records related to his involvement in his family’s business dealings and influence peddling around the world—including in CHINA!  https://t.co/H8RSR1tljV

1316501350658707456 2020-10-14 15:09:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So terrible that Facebook and Twitter took down the story of “Smoking Gun” emails related to Sleepy Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in the @NYPost.

1316186695579004929 2020-10-13 18:18:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> One of the most important issues for Pennsylvania is the survival of your fracking industry.

1316135799658876929 2020-10-13 14:56:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....protecting people with Pre-existing conditions. He has done nothing on Healthcare, cost or otherwise, or virtually anything else. An empty suit!!!
1316135797502996481 2020-10-13 14:56:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> How dare failed Presidential Candidate (1% and falling!) @CoryBooker make false charges and statements about me in addressing Judge Barrett. Illegally, never even lived in Newark when he was Mayor. Guy is a total loser! I want better Healthcare for far less money, always.....

1316031426618327040 2020-10-13 08:01:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> STIMULUS! Go big or go home!!!
1316011746973286400 2020-10-13 06:43:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The Radical Left is trying hard to undermine the Christopher Columbus legacy. A great Italian opened new chapter in history of humanity by discovering the Americas”.  @OANN  Not on my watch!
1315988404694396929 2020-10-13 05:11:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Actually, Tony’s pitching arm is far more accurate than his prognostications. “No problem, no masks”. WHO no longer likes Lockdowns - just came out against. Trump was right. We saved 2,000,000 USA lives!!!
1315985954767802369 2020-10-13 05:01:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We love the people of Lake Charles, Louisiana. You’ve been hit hard , and often, but your Federal Government is there to help. It will all work out, and FAST!!! @fema @USArmy
1315983317620215808 2020-10-13 04:50:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Republicans will be providing far better Healthcare than the Democrats, at a far lower cost...And will always protect people with Pre-existing conditions!!!!
1315982627933949954 2020-10-13 04:48:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> GOP raises over 1 Billion Dollars through @WINRED since recent founding. November 3rd. The most important Election in the History of our Country!!!
1315981668784709632 2020-10-13 04:44:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> California hired a pure Sleepy Joe Democrat firm to count and “harvest” votes. No way Republicans get a fair shake. Lawyers, get started!!! @GOPLeader  California is in big trouble. Vote Trump and watch the greatest comeback of them all!!! Also, New York and Illinois - go for it!

1315968499370668032 2020-10-13 03:51:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Matt is great. Strong on Military, Vets and our great 2nd Amendment. Has my Complete and Total Endorsement!!!
1315955387162656768 2020-10-13 02:59:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mitt can’t be thrilled about this! Joe also said yesterday he’s running for the U.S. Senate (again) and totally forgot where he was (wrong State!). Joe has never been a nice or kind guy, so it’s easier to find this obvious &amp; rapidly getting worse “dementia” unacceptable for USA!
1315871590685564930 2020-10-12 21:26:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....Much of the money we have spent is on our ground game, said to be the best ever put together. I’ll let you know how good it is on November 3rd. Very expensive to do, but opportunity could be BIG! I will spend additional money if we are not spending enough!
1315871589129498625 2020-10-12 21:26:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I keep reading Fake News stories that my campaign is running low on money. Not true, &amp; if it were so, I would put up money myself. The fact is that we have much more money than we had 4 years ago, where we spent much less money than Crooked Hillary, and still easily won, 306-223!
1315868183459508226 2020-10-12 21:13:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great Florida Rally tonight. Big crowd, lot of enthusiasm (you win races with enthusiasm). Just got back. Tomorrow night it’s off to Pennsylvania and another BIG crowd. We are winning. Economy is starting to boom. Good timing!!!

1315811428146634755 2020-10-12 17:27:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I did more in 47 months than Biden did in 47 years. Now, he is pushing the most far-left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee...  https://t.co/ON0iRBfFS2
1315810865216581632 2020-10-12 17:25:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden refuses to answer questions on packing the Supreme Court. He says voters “don’t deserve” to know. If they win, Dems will pack the #SCOTUS w/ radical left justices who will shred the #2A, empower violent mobs, and shield deadly criminals &amp; terrorists.  https://t.co/alVSZUDc73
1315809747677843456 2020-10-12 17:21:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden’s agenda would be a catastrophe for Florida Seniors. For years, Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal healthcare for illegal aliens—decimating Medicare and destroying Social Security... https://t.co/GgHP0NvpEe
1315808215435636737 2020-10-12 17:14:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> It was great to be back in my home state of FLORIDA to make my official return to the campaign trail. I am energized by your prayers, humbled by your support, and absolutely determined to finish what we started and Make America Greater than Ever Before!  https://t.co/XrQG0KPdUo

1315782471783383040 2020-10-12 15:32:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Getting ready to land in Florida. BIG CROWD! Live on various networks: @OANN, @cspan, @newsmax and others!!!
1315781835515817984 2020-10-12 15:30:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@FoxNews allows more negative ads on me than practically all of the other networks combined. Not like the old days, but we will win even bigger than 2016. Roger Ailes was the GREATEST!
1315779944002199552 2020-10-12 15:22:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “I’m running as a proud Democrat, for the Senate”. Sleepy Joe Biden today. It’s only going to get worse. It is not sustainable for our County - China will own us!!!!
1315778779097100289 2020-10-12 15:18:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden losing big in Florida. Only Fake Polls show otherwise! Bad for Healthcare. Thinks he’s running for the Senate. Forgot Mitt Romney’s name, and where he was!
1315775454557532160 2020-10-12 15:04:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Happy National Farmers Day!  https://t.co/2Q8dbu5UyO
1315769883318124544 2020-10-12 14:42:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The World Health Organization just admitted that I was right. Lockdowns are killing countries all over the world. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. Open up your states, Democrat governors. Open up New York. A long battle, but they finally did the right thing!
1315762862640439296 2020-10-12 14:14:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Republicans should be strongly focused on completing a wonderful stimulus package for the American People!
1315761931303624704 2020-10-12 14:11:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> What’s going on, almost nobody is showing up for Sleepy Joe rallies!
1315761783177576450 2020-10-12 14:10:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Sleepy Joe Biden had a particularly bad day today. He couldn’t remember the name of Mitt Romney, said again he was running for the U.S. Senate, and forgot what State he was in. If I did any of this, it would be disqualifying. With him, he’s just Sleepy Joe!
1315752374137479174 2020-10-12 13:33:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He should sue the women, and all of those who illegally worked with them, for false and disgusting accusations!!!
1315750286250704896 2020-10-12 13:24:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Cuomo Dodges on Whether Sending COVID Patients into Nursing Homes Was a Mistake  https://t.co/okkpcFyO3n via @BreitbartNews. He really blew it. Could have put people in Convention Center or Hospital Ship. Didn’t have a clue!!!

1315747649681870849 2020-10-12 13:14:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Viewership for NBA Finals Finale Crash Nearly 70%, Beaten by Random Sunday Night Football Game  https://t.co/RaDVRSE4ww via @BreitbartNews Maybe they were watching in China, but I doubt it. Zero interest!
1315746176021528577 2020-10-12 13:08:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden has let the Unions down — always has, always will!
1315744432042528769 2020-10-12 13:01:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> 307,000 Veterans Died waiting for Healthcare at the V.A. During Sleepy Joe Biden’s Watch. 800,000 Records Stalled! A complete and total disaster.
1315742009760657408 2020-10-12 12:51:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Heading to the Greatest Economy Of All Time!!!  VOTE
1315741721142140929 2020-10-12 12:50:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So Biden is coughing and hacking and playing “fingers” with his mask, all over the place, and the Fake News doesn’t want to even think about discussing it. “Journalism” has reached the all time low in history. Sadly, Lamestream knows this and doesn’t even care!
1315735543003721729 2020-10-12 12:26:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Almost nobody showed up to the Sleepy Joe Biden “Rally” in Ohio. The reporting and polls are a Media Con Job - Fake News. We have far more support and enthusiasm than even in 2016. November 3rd. will be a great day for America!!!  #MAGA
1315706457271267329 2020-10-12 10:30:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> HAPPY COLUMBUS DAY TO ALL!

1315695492676890631 2020-10-12 09:47:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Economy is about ready to go through the roof. Stock Market ready to break ALL-TIME RECORD. 401k’s incredible. New Jobs Record. Remember all of this when you VOTE. Sleepy Joe wants to quadruple your Taxes. Depression!!! Don’t let it happen! #MAGA
1315682595766784004 2020-10-12 08:55:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Republicans must state loudly and clearly that WE are going to provide much better Healthcare at a much lower cost. Get the word out! Will always protect pre-existing conditions!!!
1315681158752096256 2020-10-12 08:50:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump>  https://t.co/599e8A6ogf
1315680867919040513 2020-10-12 08:48:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will have Healthcare which is FAR BETTER than ObamaCare, at a FAR LOWER COST - BIG PREMIUM REDUCTION. PEOPLE WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS WILL BE PROTECTED AT AN EVEN HIGHER LEVEL THAN NOW. HIGHLY UNPOPULAR AND UNFAIR INDIVIDUAL MANDATE ALREADY TERMINATED. YOU’RE WELCOME!
1315678436904534018 2020-10-12 08:39:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So Crazy to watch Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut lecture all on morals &amp; ethics when for 25 years he said he was a Great War Hero in Vietnam, and he was never even there. He lied &amp; cheated right up until the day he got caught. Thank you to those in military who turned him in!
1315668059751931904 2020-10-12 07:58:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> STOCK MARKET UP BIG!
1315667018696273921 2020-10-12 07:53:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Remember, I wouldn’t be President now had Obama and Biden properly done their job. The fact is, they were TERRIBLE!!!
1315665495383781376 2020-10-12 07:47:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> November 3rd. will be the most exciting day in U.S. Election History, even more so than 2016. Tremendous excitement and enthusiasm, like perhaps never seen before. Nobody showing up to Sleepy Joe Rallies. Places are DEAD. Stiff!!! See you in Florida tonight.
1315659219287314433 2020-10-12 07:22:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Maxine Waters has long been considered “the most corrupt person in Congress”. Only habit keeps her there. Vote for Joe E. Collins lll and get this long time CROOK, Maxine Waters, out of office!!!
1315657598235013121 2020-10-12 07:16:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Stock Market Up Big. Do I get no credit for this? Never even mentioned by the Fake News. A New Record for Stocks and Jobs Growth. Remember, “it’s the Economy Stupid”.  VOTE!!!
1315654125640732672 2020-10-12 07:02:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Our Country cannot survive as a Socialist Nation, and that’s what the Democrats want it to be. The USA will never become a large scale version of Venezuela. All control is already being taken away from Sleepy Joe. He has Zero to say!!!
1315652617863864320 2020-10-12 06:56:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Republicans are giving the Democrats a great deal of time, which is not mandated, to make their self serving statements relative to our great new future Supreme Court Justice. Personally, I would pull back, approve, and go for STIMULUS for the people!!!
1315639802084110336 2020-10-12 06:05:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Remember, Stock Market at an All Time High, and going up. 401k’s at RECORD. With Sleepy Joe comes Tax Increases, jobs losses and DEPRESSION like never seen before!!! VOTE!!!

1315631984861949953 2020-10-12 05:34:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He should have been prosecuted for the threats he made to the Justices. Pathetic!

1315625603329122304 2020-10-12 05:09:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Leading by a lot!
1315624311558934536 2020-10-12 05:04:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Rigged!
1315624226737577987 2020-10-12 05:03:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> No. A Rigged Election!
1315623184729858048 2020-10-12 04:59:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The FBI and Law Enforcement must focus their energy on ANTIFA and the Radical Left, those who have spent the summer trying to burn down poorly run Democrat Cities throughout the USA!
1315621458056536070 2020-10-12 04:52:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big spike in the China Plague in Europe and other places that the Fake News used to hold up as examples of places that are doing well, in order to make the U.S look bad. Be strong and vigilant, it will run its course. Vaccines and cures are coming fast!
1315618688612159489 2020-10-12 04:41:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> These are Biden fools. ANTIFA RADICALS. Get them FBI, and get them now!
1315617492606353408 2020-10-12 04:37:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Taking advantage of fools. Law &amp; Order! Portland, call in the Feds!
1315616788986712065 2020-10-12 04:34:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Put these animals in jail, now. The Radical Left only knows how to take advantage of very dumb “leadership” fools. This is Biden! Law &amp; Order!
1315615735612346369 2020-10-12 04:30:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Radical Left fools in Portland don’t want any help from real Law Enforcement which we will provide instantaneously. Vote!
1315480195990781952 2020-10-11 19:31:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Record 96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. 53% Approval Rating Overall. Record 56% “Better Off Now” than 4 Years Ago (Gallup) during the Obama/Sleepy Joe Biden Administration, even as we round the turn on the China Plague. Thank you. Next year will be the BEST EVER!!!
1315469484472307712 2020-10-11 18:48:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> It’s the only way they know!
1315454491441934336 2020-10-11 17:49:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “56% of registered voters tell Gallup that they are better off than they were 4 years ago (under Obama/Biden), while only 32% said they were worse off.” Highest number on satisfaction yet recorded, by far. mgoodwin@nypost.com... And it will only get better!!! VOTE
1315454466418712576 2020-10-11 17:49:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Turn California around. No more shutdowns, rolling blackouts, forest fires (management), or water rationing (because millions of gallons are stupidly routed out into the Pacific Ocean). VOTE TRUMP!
1315451046609727488 2020-10-11 17:35:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> See you in FLORIDA tomorrow night. Big Rally!!!
1315417973591547906 2020-10-11 15:24:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News, @CNN, MSDNC, the failing @nytimes, and the rest, are working overtime spewing every lie in the book to make sure they can demean and disparage, at the highest level possible, to try and win an election for a man who is totally unqualified to be your President, S.J.
1315414353105960960 2020-10-11 15:09:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They are indeed Dr. Fauci’s own words. We have done a “phenomenal” job, according to certain governors. Many people agree...And now come the Vaccines &amp; Cures, long ahead of projections!

1315341383964610562 2020-10-11 10:19:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden evades “Court Packing” question. @FoxNews  Because his puppet masters are willing to destroy the U.S. Supreme Court. Don’t let this, and so many other really bad things, happen. VOTE!
1315340545280151552 2020-10-11 10:16:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People don’t remember the chaos, hatred &amp; discord that we all went through during the 8 years of Obama/Biden. St. Louis, Oakland, Baltimore, and so many other places,  were a complete &amp; total disaster. I wouldn’t be in the beautiful White House if it weren’t for Sleepy Joe, etc.
1315316071243476997 2020-10-11 08:39:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A total and complete sign off from White House Doctors yesterday. That means I can’t get it (immune), and can’t give it. Very nice to know!!!
1315312941449740288 2020-10-11 08:26:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> AP has long been Fake News!
1315311656776409088 2020-10-11 08:21:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In 2016, the ABC News/Washington Post Poll was such a complete disaster that these two Fake News Organizations changed the numbers prior to the Election. Now these haters are trying the same thing, though on a lesser scale, again. Will have a bigger win than even 2016!
1315293995128573952 2020-10-11 07:11:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@NateSilver538  “The Trump 2016 Victory was the most shocking political development of my lifetime.” That’s only because you got it  so wrong. This time there is far more ENTHUSIASM even than 2016. Winning many States much more easily than people understand. BIG CROWDS!!!
1315106212543975425 2020-10-10 18:45:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> FDR’s own party told him you cannot PACK the United States Supreme Court, it would permanently destroy the Court. @judgejeanine @tedcruz But now the Radical Left Democrats are pushing Biden to do this. He has zero chance against them!

1315091217533882368 2020-10-10 17:45:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> As the 1st President to formally recognize the issue of Missing &amp; Murdered Native Americans, today, I was proud to sign Savanna’s Act &amp; the Not Invisible Act. We have also provided $295 Million to support public safety &amp; crime victims. Forgotten NO MORE! #OperationLadyJustice
1314998881126625280 2020-10-10 11:38:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden is a PUPPET of CASTRO-CHAVISTAS like Crazy Bernie, AOC and Castro-lover Karen Bass. Biden is supported by socialist Gustavo Petro, a major LOSER and former M-19 guerrilla leader. Biden is weak on socialism and will betray Colombia. I stand with you!
1314998775451201542 2020-10-10 11:38:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congratulations to former President @AlvaroUribeVel, a hero, former recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom and an ally of our Country in the fight against CASTRO-CHAVISMO! I will always stand with our Colombian friends!

1314410650144329728 2020-10-08 20:41:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hello!
1314410306584694784 2020-10-08 20:40:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will save your a Second Amendment, Virginia. He is going to take it away. Vote Trump!

1314402920474042371 2020-10-08 20:10:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Gallup Poll has just come out with the incredible finding that 56% of you say that you are better off today, during a pandemic, than you were four years ago (OBiden). Highest number on record! Pretty amazing!
1314377609313243138 2020-10-08 18:30:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...I do not tolerate ANY extreme violence. Defending ALL Americans, even those who oppose and attack me, is what I will always do as your President! Governor Whitmer—open up your state, open up your schools, and open up your churches!
1314377608470159365 2020-10-08 18:30:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...today that they foiled a dangerous plot against the Governor of Michigan. Rather than say thank you, she calls me a White Supremacist—while Biden and Democrats refuse to condemn Antifa, Anarchists, Looters and Mobs that burn down Democrat run cities...
1314377607379640320 2020-10-08 18:30:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Governor Whitmer of Michigan has done a terrible job. She locked down her state for everyone, except her husband’s boating activities. The Federal Government provided tremendous help to the Great People of Michigan. My Justice Department and Federal Law Enforcement announced...
1314372012735959040 2020-10-08 18:08:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden is against Oil, Guns and Religion, a very bad combination to be fighting in the Great State of Texas. We are Winning Big, in the Real Polls, all over the Country!!! NOVEMBER 3rd. VOTE!!!
1314367198169792512 2020-10-08 17:48:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Also, they want to Raise Taxes Big and Obliterate your great Second Amendment!!!

1314347971048284165 2020-10-08 16:32:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great honor to have the endorsement of the Governor of Puerto Rico, Wanda Vázquez Garced. As I have always said, Donald J. Trump is the best thing to ever happen to the people of Puerto Rico. The drug manufacturers are now coming back. Biden ended that program! @wandavazquezg
1314288576146927619 2020-10-08 12:36:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Looking forward to speaking with the Great Rush and guests!
1314287204873764865 2020-10-08 12:31:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Kamala Harris Lied Repeatedly and Got Away With It:  https://t.co/gIkEh1UwKF
1314287202935992320 2020-10-08 12:31:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Crazy Nancy is the one who should be under observation. They don’t call her Crazy for nothing!
1314279388570169345 2020-10-08 11:59:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden has no plan for Coronavirus - ALL TALK! He was a disaster in his handling of H1N1 Swine Flu. He didn’t have a clue, with his own Chief of Staff so saying. If he were in charge, perhaps 2.2 million people would have died from this much more lethal disease!
1314252606110412806 2020-10-08 10:13:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> TO MY FAVORITE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD!  https://t.co/38DbQtUxEu
1314236926770241537 2020-10-08 09:11:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania would absolutely die without the jobs and dollars brought in by Fracking. Massive numbers! Now Biden &amp; Harris, after Radical Left Dem Primaries, are trying to change their stance. Pennsylvania wants Energy and Second Amendment!
1314234952612024322 2020-10-08 09:03:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If a Republican LIED like Biden and Harris do, constantly, the Lamestream Media would be calling them out at a level never recorded before. For one year they called for No Fracking and big Tax Increases. Now they each say opposite. Fake News is working overtime!
1314229843018555392 2020-10-08 08:43:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden will Shutdown the Economy at the tip of a hat, raise your Taxes, knock out your Second Amendment and Defund, or close, your Police. The Suburbs would be next, get ready. Also, and incredibly, PACK THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. This is not what the USA wants!!!  #MAGA

1314017484262047745 2020-10-07 18:39:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden and Kamala Harris BOTH want to BAN FRACKING.  https://t.co/FpcvoVXcKH
1313996348694433792 2020-10-07 17:15:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Obama, Biden, Crooked Hillary and many others got caught in a Treasonous Act of Spying and Government Overthrow, a Criminal Act. How is Biden now allowed to run for President?
1313987006230298625 2020-10-07 16:38:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden supports Cory Booker’s Bill that will force low income housing in the Suburbs, which will lower property values and bring crime to your neighborhoods. If Dems win, GOODBYE SUBURBS!
1313985879220850689 2020-10-07 16:33:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> My highly regarded Executive Order protected 525,000 American jobs during the height of the Chinese Plague. Democrats want to have Open Borders!
1313984510749544450 2020-10-07 16:28:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We should have the small remaining number of our BRAVE Men and Women serving in Afghanistan home by Christmas!

1313849980906614785 2020-10-07 07:33:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> She is far further left than Crazy Bernie. Biden would not last a month!
1313848232716521473 2020-10-07 07:26:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Ari, THE MEDIA IS CORRUPT, JUST LIKE OUR DEMOCRAT RUN BALLOT SYSTEM IS CORRUPT! Look at what’s happening with Fake, Missing and Fraudulent Ballots all over the Country???  VOTE

1313846197162070019 2020-10-07 07:18:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He’s been a wacko for years, and everyone knows it. The Lamestream Media is stuck with him and they are just now trying to clean up his act. Notice how all of the bad things, like his very low IQ, are no longer reported? Fake News! #MAGA
1313844080149966848 2020-10-07 07:10:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you!
1313843369785856002 2020-10-07 07:07:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Talks unity but illegally spied on my campaign, and much worse - COUP! Too late for the nice talk Sleepy Joe! VOTE
1313842083606802435 2020-10-07 07:02:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Where are all of the arrests? Can you imagine if the roles were reversed? Long term sentences would have started two years ago. Shameful!

1313817202404007937 2020-10-07 05:23:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I just hope the voter understands that they are all Fake News trying hard to push a man that should NEVER be president of our Country.
1313815894494261251 2020-10-07 05:18:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Because I’ve beaten him and his very few remaining clients so much, and so badly, that he has become a blathering idiot. He failed with John McCain and will fail again with all others. He is a total loser. @MarshaBlackburn is a Tennessee Star, a highly respected WINNER!

1313661368856457217 2020-10-06 19:04:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> 11,00 North Carolina residents get incorrect voter registration forms. 2000 LA County Voters received “faulty” Ballots, with NO WAY TO VOTE FOR PRESIDENT. Many others throughout USA. Here we go. This will be the most corrupt Election in American History!
1313658825040371712 2020-10-06 18:54:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The House &amp; Senate should IMMEDIATELY Approve 25 Billion Dollars for Airline Payroll Support, &amp; 135 Billion Dollars for Paycheck Protection Program for Small Business. Both of these will be fully paid for with unused funds from the Cares Act. Have this money. I will sign now!
1313654133153583104 2020-10-06 18:35:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wear your mask in the “beauty” parlor, Nancy!
1313653514783141889 2020-10-06 18:32:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So I had to constantly fight off all of this Scum, achieve more than any other President in First Term, and then they talk Chaos. They created crimes against me and this administration!
1313652590710841347 2020-10-06 18:29:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A Disgraceful Con Artist! Charges anyone?
1313652020641959936 2020-10-06 18:27:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Taking too long. Media is in on it. A true scandal!
1313650640699224069 2020-10-06 18:21:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All Russia Hoax Scandal information was Declassified by me long ago. Unfortunately for our Country, people have acted very slowly, especially since it is perhaps the biggest political crime in the history of our Country. Act!!!
1313647605134614529 2020-10-06 18:09:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> New FDA Rules make it more difficult for them to speed up vaccines for approval before Election Day. Just another political hit job! @SteveFDA
1313645330789994499 2020-10-06 18:00:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Chris Wallace was a total JOKE. Protected Joe all night long. He’s no Mike!!!
1313642815054897152 2020-10-06 17:50:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> His all time favorite ad. Disgraceful!
1313642403044167680 2020-10-06 17:48:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Can’t believe these con men are not yet being PROSECUTED. Pathetic!
1313641459082563584 2020-10-06 17:45:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> It will be fast and easy!
1313641120853884934 2020-10-06 17:43:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Because Mueller and his 18 Angry Democrats were illegally in on the SCAM?
1313640512025513984 2020-10-06 17:41:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I have fully authorized the total Declassification of any &amp; all documents pertaining to the single greatest political CRIME in American History, the Russia Hoax. Likewise, the Hillary Clinton Email Scandal. No redactions!
1313630105831383041 2020-10-06 16:59:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Republicans need to get smart and confirm Nate Simington to the FCC ASAP! @SenatorWicker Thank you!
1313624267842560000 2020-10-06 16:36:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Crazy Nancy Pelosi and the Radical Left Democrats were just playing “games” with the desperately needed Workers Stimulus Payments.They just wanted to take care of Democrat failed, high crime, Cities and States. They were never in it to help the workers, and they never will be!
1313615182535499779 2020-10-06 16:00:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> True!
1313584866932527105 2020-10-06 14:00:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> How does Biden lead in Pennsylvania Polls when he is against Fracking (JOBS!), 2nd Amendment and Religion? Fake Polls. I will win Pennsylvania!
1313551798142152704 2020-10-06 11:48:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...also coming back in record numbers. We are leading the World in Economic Recovery, and THE BEST IS YET TO COME!

1313551794623127552 2020-10-06 11:48:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Nancy Pelosi is asking for $2.4 Trillion Dollars to bailout poorly run, high crime, Democrat States, money that is in no way related to COVID-19. We made a very generous offer of $1.6 Trillion Dollars and, as usual, she is not negotiating in good faith. I am rejecting their...
1313529166265020417 2020-10-06 10:18:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Did anyone get to see that absolute “Joke” of a Town Hall interview that Joe Biden did with Concast @NBCNews , hosted by Lester Holt? What a disgrace to our Country that FREE public airwaves can be used that way. All SOFTBALLS. A big FIX. Time should be paid by the corrupt DNC!
1313511340124917760 2020-10-06 09:08:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> REPEAL SECTION 230!!!
1313510118437392384 2020-10-06 09:03:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media refuses to discuss how good the Economy and Stock Market, including JOBS under the Trump Administration, are doing. We will soon be in RECORD TERRITORY. All they want to discuss is COVID 19, where they won’t say it, but we beat the Dems all day long, also!!!

1313503322087870465 2020-10-06 08:36:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mini Mike Bloomberg, who made a fool of himself on the Dems debate stage when Elizabeth Warren &amp; the others simply took him apart, is going “crazy” trying to buy his way back into the Liberal Democrat’s hearts. His Florida ads are lies. I am much better for SENIORS than Sleepy!
1313494418314457090 2020-10-06 08:00:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> NEW MEXICO! Today is the last day you can register to vote online or via mail. Make sure your vote counts!   https://t.co/WwzdPhDkAZ

1313489465139134464 2020-10-06 07:41:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> FEELING GREAT!
1313449844413992961 2020-10-06 05:03:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flu season is coming up! Many people every year, sometimes over 100,000, and despite the Vaccine, die from the Flu. Are we going to close down our Country? No, we have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to live with Covid, in most populations far less lethal!!!
1313445293912920064 2020-10-06 04:45:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden and Democrats just clarified the fact that they are fully in favor of (very) LATE TERM ABORTION, right up until the time of birth, and beyond - which would be execution. Biden even endorsed the Governor of Virginia, who stated this clearly for all to hear. GET OUT &amp; VOTE!!!
1313443879253946370 2020-10-06 04:39:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. Joe Biden just took a more Liberal position on Roe v. Wade than Elizabeth Warren at her highest. He also wants to PACK our great United States Supreme Court. This is what the Dems will do. Remember as they try changing positions before elections end. GET OUT AND VOTE!

1313186529058136070 2020-10-05 11:37:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will be leaving the great Walter Reed Medical Center today at 6:30 P.M. Feeling really good! Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs &amp; knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago!
1313183801732890624 2020-10-05 11:26:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> It is reported that the Media is upset because I got into a secure vehicle to say thank you to the many fans and supporters who were standing outside of the hospital for many hours, and even days, to pay their respect to their President. If I didn’t do it, Media would say RUDE!!!

1311497943363379200 2020-09-30 19:47:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> As VP, Biden wiped out the Iron Range – seven plants were idled and more than 2K workers were laid off. After I put Tariffs on foreign steel, the Iron Range came roaring back to life! If Joe gets in, the Radical Left will shut down the Iron Range FOREVER!  https://t.co/2Gk2uOjaCW

1311492120826449920 2020-09-30 19:24:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Last night I did what the corrupt media has refused to do: I held Joe Biden Accountable for his 47 years of lies, 47 years of betrayals, and 47 years of failure. The whole nation saw the truth — Joe Biden is too weak to lead this Country!  https://t.co/8WepHOC0XN

1311423289542180865 2020-09-30 14:50:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just landed in Minnesota. Hasn’t been won by a Republican since 1972, and we saved Minneapolis. Also opened the massive and beautiful Iron Range, which Obama and Sleepy Joe closed.  Thousands of jobs started back. They will close again. How can we lose?
1311414741907116032 2020-09-30 14:16:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> HIGHEST CABLE TELEVISION RATINGS OF ALL TIME. SECOND HIGHEST OVERALL TELEVISION RATINGS OF ALL TIME. Some day these Fake Media Companies are going to miss me, very badly!!!
1311402331934605312 2020-09-30 13:27:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So weird to watch @FoxNews interviewing only failed Dems, like Represenative Tim Ryan of Ohio, who got zero percent in his recent presidential run, and following Sleepy Joe’s train to wherever. What a difference from the past - But we will win anyway!!!

1311371720436199434 2020-09-30 11:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left Democrats are going CRAZY!
1311371174245535751 2020-09-30 11:23:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Such a timid group of reporters at the Biden Press Conference. Where do these people come from?
1311365647008444416 2020-09-30 11:01:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many more people would have died from the China Virus if Sleepy Joe were your President. He didn’t even want me to close our Country to Infected China until TWO MONTHS  later, when he said I was right. Now he likes to say I didn’t close up “fast enough”. Just another politician!

1311328767395205124 2020-09-30 08:35:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! 100,000 Mail In Ballots in New York City a total MESS. Mayor and Governor have no idea what to do. Big Fraud, Unfixable! Cancel Ballots and go out and VOTE, just like in past decades, when there were no problems!
1311310383781679107 2020-09-30 07:22:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden REFUSED to use the term, LAW &amp; ORDER! There go the Suburbs.
1311308087593242624 2020-09-30 07:13:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden wants to Pack the Supreme Court, thereby ruining it. Also, he wants no fracking, killing our Energy business, and JOBS. Second Amendment is DEAD if Biden gets in! Is that what you want from a leader? He will destroy our Country! VOTE NOW USA.
1311297684540620801 2020-09-30 06:31:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Nobody wants Sleepy Joe as a leader, including the Radical Left (which he lost last night!). He disrespected Bernie, effectively calling him a loser!
1311294017469063171 2020-09-30 06:17:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Chris had a tough night. Two on one was not surprising, but  fun. Many important points made, like throwing Bernie, AOC PLUS 3, and the rest, to the wolves! Radical Left is dumping Sleepy Joe. Zero Democrat enthusiasm, WEAK Leadership!

1310588453277650945 2020-09-28 07:33:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden just announced that he will not agree to a Drug Test. Gee, I wonder why?
1310587471231582208 2020-09-28 07:29:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .....Financial Statements, from  the time I announced I was going to run for President,  showing all properties, assets and debts. It is a very IMPRESSIVE Statement, and also shows that I am the only President on record to give up my yearly $400,000 plus Presidential Salary!
1310587470090731520 2020-09-28 07:29:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .....Also, if you look at the extraordinary assets owned by me, which the Fake News hasn’t, I am extremely under leveraged - I have very little debt compared to the value of assets. Much of this information is already on file, but I have long said that I may release....
1310587468731879431 2020-09-28 07:29:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media, just like Election time 2016, is bringing up my Taxes &amp; all sorts of other nonsense with illegally obtained information &amp; only bad intent. I paid many millions of dollars in taxes but was entitled, like everyone else, to depreciation &amp; tax credits.....
1310585397630689280 2020-09-28 07:21:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Ballots being returned to States cannot be accurately counted. Many things are already going very wrong!
1310436408658669568 2020-09-27 21:29:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great book!
1310435345704652800 2020-09-27 21:25:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is totally illegal. Hope that the U.S. Attorney in Minnesota has this, and other of her many misdeeds, under serious review??? If not, why not??? We will win Minnesota because of her, and law enforcement. Saved Minneapolis &amp; Iron O Range!

1310217371307606024 2020-09-27 06:58:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow, nobody realized how far Mini Mike Bloomberg went in bribing ex-prisoners to go out and vote for Sleepy Joe. He is desperate to get back into the good graces of the people who not only badly beat him, but made him look like a total fool. Now he’s committed a serious crime!
1310215205650128897 2020-09-27 06:50:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> YES, for many years, and hundreds of times a year. He is a Senatorial JOKE!
1310213777175048192 2020-09-27 06:44:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hanoi Dick, who lied for years by saying he was a war hero in Vietnam, and was never even there (Impeach him!), should not be entitled to a vote on anything of importance!
1310211120922230784 2020-09-27 06:34:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will be strongly demanding a Drug Test of Sleepy Joe Biden prior to, or after, the Debate on Tuesday night. Naturally, I will agree to take one also. His Debate performances have been record setting UNEVEN, to put it mildly. Only drugs could have caused this discrepancy???

1306657377823993857 2020-09-17 11:12:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Unsolicited Ballots are uncontrollable, totally open to ELECTION INTERFERENCE by foreign countries, and will lead to massive chaos and confusion!

1306566773739851776 2020-09-17 05:12:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Democrats only want BAILOUT MONEY for Blue States that are doing badly. They don’t care about the people, never did!
1306565405968920577 2020-09-17 05:07:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Twitter makes sure that Trending on Twitter is anything bad, Fake or not, about President Donald Trump. So obvious what they are doing. Being studied now!
1306564340972228608 2020-09-17 05:03:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am SUBSTANTIALLY LOWERING MEDICARE PREMIUMS. Have instituted Favored Nations Clause and Rebates on Drug Companies. Never been done before. Drug companies are hitting me with Fake Ads, just like sleepy Joe. Be careful! Drug prices will be reduced massively, and soon.
1306562791894122504 2020-09-17 04:56:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> @TrueTheVote There is a group of people (largely Radical Left Democrats) that want ELECTION MAYHEM. States must end this CRAZY mass sending of Ballots. Also, a GIFT to foreign interference into our election!!! Stop it now, before it is too late.
1306559853683445760 2020-09-17 04:45:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The big Unsolicited Ballot States should give it up NOW, before it is too late, and ask people to go to the Polling Booths and, like always before, VOTE. Otherwise, MAYHEM!!! Solicited Ballots (absentee) are OK. @foxandfriends

1306244076065431552 2020-09-16 07:50:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Jim, you didn’t make a mistake. It’s true, and that’s why you said it. No pandering!
1306239033891315713 2020-09-16 07:30:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Democrats are “heartless”. They don’t want to give STIMULUS PAYMENTS to people who desperately need the money, and whose fault it was NOT that the plague came in from China. Go for the much higher numbers, Republicans, it all comes back to the USA anyway (one way or another!).

I thought the NFL learned their lesson two years ago. The people will not put up with this (again). Just not worth it, hard to watch!

1305866347197456385 2020-09-15 06:49:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We are advertising all over the place, but as much as we do, the Fake News likes to say we aren’t. Just being smart. We have much more money than we had at same time in 2016. Also spending on other, and different, elements of the campaign. Starting to get great poll numbers!

1305693861067407365 2020-09-14 19:24:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Did you see where Joe Biden — as Weak, Tired, and Sleepy as he is, went to a Polling Place today in Delaware (of course!) to VOTE!? If Biden can do it, any American can do it!

1305693617969754113 2020-09-14 19:23:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We had great rallies this past weekend, after the Governor of Nevada worked very hard to cancel all of our venues.

1305606787362508800 2020-09-14 13:38:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Rasmussen was one of the most accurate polls in 2016. Actually, I think, based on Crowds and Enthusiasm (of which Sleepy Joe has none!), that we are MUCH higher than 51%. The only thing Joe can count on is that a Federal Judge doesn’t eviscerate the Fake Ballot Rigging Scam!

1305005768551223298 2020-09-12 21:49:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am running for re-election to bring prosperity to Nevada, to put violent criminals behind bars, and to ensure the future belongs to AMERICA—NOT China. If we win, AMERICA WINS! If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden Wins, the rioters, anarchists, and arsonists win. VOTE! #MAGA
1305002222434963456 2020-09-12 21:35:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I did more in 47 months as President than Sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years! #MAGA  https://t.co/EzcAswmrYE
1304998365676015621 2020-09-12 21:20:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...The far-left maniacs supporting Joe Biden are burning flags and chanting “America was never great.” But we know the truth: America is the most Exceptional Nation on earth, and our destiny is blessed by God!
1304998359367704576 2020-09-12 21:20:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden cannot LEAD our Country, because he does not BELIEVE in our Country. At Biden’s convention, they decried America as a wicked, sinful nation, destined for a fate of doom and despair. They even removed the words “Under God” from the Pledge of Allegiance – twice...
1304994966343565314 2020-09-12 21:07:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU NEVADA! #MAGA   https://t.co/E98NXRPllj
1304962645620006912 2020-09-12 18:58:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just landed in Nevada but while on Air Force One watched most vicious TV commercial I have ever seen. Pathetic Joe’s people placed an unsourced ad where they have me saying unthinkable things about soldiers while standing over their graves. It is a MADE UP LIE. A TOTAL CON JOB!
1304954913248522241 2020-09-12 18:27:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just landed, see you soon Minden, Nevada. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  https://t.co/cUQxBeK3hQ
1304936900327649281 2020-09-12 17:16:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> While I travel the Country, Joe sleeps in his basement, telling the Fake News Media to “get lost”. If you’re a reporter covering Sleepy Joe, you have basically gone into retirement!
1304936291054710784 2020-09-12 17:13:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Once again, Sleepy Joe told the press they could go home at 9 A.M. Meanwhile, your Favorite President, me, will go to Reno, Nevada tonight, three stops in Las Vegas tomorrow, with California and Arizona on schedule Monday. Don’t worry, we won’t be taking off Tuesday, either!

1304879424920190977 2020-09-12 13:27:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All that time and money spent, and it turns out that the Mueller Investigation was a total SCAM!
1304875170860015617 2020-09-12 13:10:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Unsolicited Mail In Ballot Scam is a major threat to our Democracy, &amp; the Democrats know it. Almost all recent elections using this system, even though much smaller &amp;  with far fewer Ballots to count, have ended up being a disaster. Large numbers of missing Ballots &amp; Fraud!

1304769412759724033 2020-09-12 06:10:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> NORTH CAROLINA: To make sure your Ballot COUNTS, sign &amp; send it in EARLY. When Polls open, go to your Polling Place to see if it was COUNTED. IF NOT, VOTE! Your signed Ballot will not count because your vote has been posted. Don’t let them illegally take your vote away from you!
1304769134341885953 2020-09-12 06:09:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Was Andy McCabe ever forced to pay back the $700,000 illegally given to him and his wife, for his wife’s political campaign, by Crooked Hillary Clinton while Hillary was under FBI investigation, and McCabe was the head of the FBI??? Just askin’?
1304767518775611394 2020-09-12 06:03:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....It has now been determined that the Mueller Scam should never have been set up in the first place, there were no grounds. It was all an illegitimate Witch Hunt, &amp; a big price must be paid. How different my life would have been if this fraud on America was never committed!!!
1304767518112964608 2020-09-12 06:03:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ALERT: So now we find out that the entire Mueller “hit squad” illegally wiped their phones clean just prior to the investigation of them, all using the same really dumb reason for this “accident”, just like Crooked Hillary smashing her phones with a hammer, &amp; DELETING HER EMAILS!

1304242043116552194 2020-09-10 19:15:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I have taken the toughest-ever action to stand up to China’s rampant theft of Michigan jobs. Sleepy Joe Biden has vowed to remove those Tariffs and allow China to resume its pillaging. Joe Biden’s Agenda is Made in China, my agenda is Made in the USA!  https://t.co/z8EuVOUYLE
1304237564203679745 2020-09-10 18:57:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If Joe Biden is elected, far-left lunatics won’t just be running failed Dem Cities—they will be running the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Supreme Court. No city, town or suburb will be safe. On November 3rd, your vote will SAVE AMERICA!  https://t.co/N8TZagbEpr

1304236582300348417 2020-09-10 18:53:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> On November 3rd, Michigan will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity—or whether we allow Sleepy Joe Biden to impose a $4 TRILLION DOLLAR TAX HIKE, ban American Energy, confiscate your guns, shutdown the economy, shutdown auto production, delay...
1304235190571597824 2020-09-10 18:47:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> When we win I, as your President, will totally forgive ALL deferred payroll taxes with money from the General Fund.

1304060630656311296 2020-09-10 07:14:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrats never even mentioned the words LAW &amp; ORDER at their National Convention. That’s where they are coming from. If I don’t win, America’s Suburbs will be OVERRUN with Low Income Projects, Anarchists, Agitators, Looters and, of course, “Friendly Protesters”.
1304055016731422722 2020-09-10 06:51:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Democrats, OPEN THE SCHOOLS ( SAFELY), NOW! When schools are closed, let the money follow the child (FAMILY). Why should schools be paid when they are closed? They shouldn’t!
1304042651147284480 2020-09-10 06:02:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Bob Woodward had my quotes for many months.

No, because he knew they were good and proper answers. Calm, no panic!

1304040990550958081 2020-09-10 05:56:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Obama is lucky he ran against @MittRomney, a man with very little talent or political skill, as opposed to someone who knows how to fight and win!
1304040627332689920 2020-09-10 05:54:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Sending out 80 MILLION BALLOTS to people who aren’t even asking for a Ballot is unfair and a total fraud in the making. Look at what’s going on right now!
1304039852988493824 2020-09-10 05:51:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Comey is a disgraced lier &amp; leaker. Two years wasted on the Russia Witch Hunt was in large part because of his failings as Director of the FBI. They refused to support the results of the 2016 Election.

1304037450793115648 2020-09-10 05:42:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Now @FoxNews is putting on yet another loser, Jamie Weinstein, into their stable of Trump haters. People who failed for many years are now going on Fox to explain “Trump”. Schumer puppet Chris Hahn and his twin brother, Richard Goodstein, together with cheater Donna Brazil. Bad!
1304036654588534789 2020-09-10 05:39:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> One of the WORST governors in the USA. Caused 11,000 deaths in nursing homes alone due to his bad moves and incompetence. At least he said I “did a phenomenal job”. But he didn’t!!!
1304036421980893184 2020-09-10 05:38:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Governor Cuomo has completely lost control. Sad!
1304034829386887168 2020-09-10 05:31:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> No, Vindman knew the call itself to the Ukrainian President was “perfect”, but also knew the whistleblower report described the call incorrectly, way off. Why didn’t Vindman say so? That’s why Shifty didn’t want the whistleblower to testify. A big scam!
1304033430062202880 2020-09-10 05:26:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> New York City indoor dining to reopen on September 30, at 25% capacity. A step in the right direction, but should go faster!
1304033005191692288 2020-09-10 05:24:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Fake News is at it again! They will take any statement from me, no matter how proper or well delivered, &amp;  systematically, in complete conjunction with all of their allies, dismantle it. With Biden, they only give him softballs, and let him read the answers from a teleprompter!

1303861737507172352 2020-09-09 18:03:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Will be interviewed by @seanhannity on @FoxNews - NOW!
1303860823975178240 2020-09-09 18:00:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> For years Fake stories and investigations, then the phony Russia, Russia, Russia HOAX, next Ukraine and the failed Impeachment, now the crummy Atlantic Magazine’s MADE UP STORY, and lastly, the political hit job by rapidly fading Bob Woodward and his boring book. It never ends!
1303843244451729413 2020-09-09 16:50:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...If in doubt, ask why the bill withholds $12 billion in highway funds until local authorities agree to federal control? I will protect the suburbs. Biden will destroy the suburbs!
1303843243277406214 2020-09-09 16:50:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Fake News asks why I bring up Booker. It’s because Biden supports Booker’s bill that forces federal control of local zoning and low income housing in suburbs...
1303835269343346688 2020-09-09 16:18:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> These are my real words about our GREAT HEROES, not made up lies by the enemy. THANK YOU and God Bless You All!  https://t.co/oFgQXzpJHU
1303832553296719873 2020-09-09 16:07:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...These are horrendous people that we must defeat on November 3rd!
1303832552243974144 2020-09-09 16:07:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...Secret Service would not allow the trip to the cemetery based on very bad weather and security concerns. Now these low-life Biden handlers are making commercials of this fictional statement, with no proof, and think they can get away with it...
1303832551241416711 2020-09-09 16:07:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> On top of a lie made up by a low-life “reporter”, who is known for disinformation, the Democrats have taken his false words and put them into a TV commercial. We now have 21 witnesses stating that the story is a BIG LIE. Even Biden admits this may not be true...
1303831588598415368 2020-09-09 16:04:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...I’ll take the Endorsement of Law Enforcement all over the Country, and Joe can have the RINO’S. This Snyder mess was made during the OBiden era - no wonder they’re friends!
1303831587524677633 2020-09-09 16:04:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The failed former Governor of Michigan, RINO Rick Snyder, who was responsible for the Flint Water Disaster (and I let him know it!), is now endorsing Sleepy Joe Biden, who doesn’t have a clue! Snyder, whose political career was ruined by Flint, hurt a lot of people in Michigan...
1303797159230402560 2020-09-09 13:47:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Today we join millions of baseball fans and Puerto Ricans in celebrating Roberto Clemente’s life and his immense contributions to baseball and equality.

1303698549054607360 2020-09-09 07:15:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The United States Navy, or the Department of Defense, will NOT be cancelling its contract with Catholic Priests who serve our men and women in the Armed Forces so well, and with such great compassion &amp; skill. This will no longer be even a point of discussion! @CardinalDolan

1303458451671011328 2020-09-08 15:21:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Police Chief, and most of the police in Rochester, N.Y., have resigned. The Democrat Mayor and, of courses, Governor Cuomo, have no idea what to do. New York State is a mess - No Money, High Taxes &amp; Crime, Everyone Fleeing. November 3rd. We can fix it!

1303404366687240194 2020-09-08 11:46:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Democrats and Sleepy Joe’s Peaceful Protestors!
1303394057926840320 2020-09-08 11:05:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Sleepy Joe Biden has pledged to ABOLISH Suburban Communites as they currently exist by reinstating Obama’s radical AFFH Regulation. There goes Suburbia!
1303390488175599622 2020-09-08 10:51:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Democrats admit that President Trump’s message is “working” on violence coming to the Suburbs in a Looney Biden Administration. Plus, Biden just doubled down on forcing Federal control of local zoning. This means low income housing and projects. So much for the American Dream!
1303388826467926017 2020-09-08 10:44:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump>  https://t.co/GYa5c9mjxs
1303380082807828480 2020-09-08 10:10:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> On my way to the Great State of Florida, see you soon!  https://t.co/6Yu6lHhX7f
1303371151792513024 2020-09-08 09:34:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They are not “peaceful protesters”, as Sleepy Joe and the Democrats call them, they are THUGS - And it is all taking place in Democrat run cities. Call me and request Federal HELP. We will solve your problems in a matter of minutes - And thanks to the U.S. Marshalls in Portland!
1303368660736598016 2020-09-08 09:24:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....Like I did in the 2016 Primaries, if more money is needed, which I doubt it will be, I will put it up!
1303368656680747008 2020-09-08 09:24:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Because of the China Virus, my Campaign, which has raised a lot of money, was forced to spend in order to counter the Fake News reporting about the way we handled it (China Ban, etc.). We did, and are doing, a GREAT job, and have a lot of money left over, much more than 2016....
1303339826016550912 2020-09-08 07:30:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Suburban voters are pouring into the Republican Party because of the violence in Democrat run cities and states. If Biden gets in, this violence is “coming to the Suburbs”, and FAST. You could say goodbye to your American Dream!
1303322616078503938 2020-09-08 06:21:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> My Campaign spent a lot of money up front in order to compensate for the false reporting and Fake News concerning our handling of the China Virus. Now they see the GREAT job we have done, and we have 3 times more than we had 4 years ago - &amp; are up in polls. Lots of $’s &amp; ENERGY!
1303313054281666584 2020-09-08 05:43:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrats will open up their states on November 4th, the day after the Election. These shutdowns are ridiculous, and only being done to hurt the economy prior to the most important election, perhaps, in our history! #MAGA
1303311207022067720 2020-09-08 05:36:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The wonderful Charles Payne @cvpayne of @FoxNews just wrote a great and inspirational new book, UNSTOPPABLE PROSPERITY. Get it NOW. So many important thoughts and suggestions on investing and “Making Money”. Also, Charles just happens to be a Great Guy!
1303305303249870854 2020-09-08 05:12:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> New York City must stop the Shutdown now. The Governor &amp; Mayor are destroying the place!
1303303789726904327 2020-09-08 05:06:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> True!
1303303534587318272 2020-09-08 05:05:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Based on their bad ratings, so would many!
1303302824747577344 2020-09-08 05:03:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great! Biden is finally being forced out of his basement. Now you’ll be able to see what is going on “up there”. He may do some “limited” campaigning. Basement Biden is no longer playing well in the Polls!
1303302195555827714 2020-09-08 05:00:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If Biden’s Polling wasn’t going down, and fast, he wouldn’t be going to Pittsburgh.
1303301299816013824 2020-09-08 04:56:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Natalie!
1303301143330787332 2020-09-08 04:56:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you!
1303301026095734789 2020-09-08 04:55:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Same guy that didn’t want to take off his mask yesterday in asking a question while being very socially distanced. Fake News!
1303298601708392448 2020-09-08 04:46:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Rigged Election!
1303296282170200064 2020-09-08 04:37:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Because the CORRUPT MEDIA doesn’t want to show all of our good work in that it will hurt the Radical Left’s Election chances! #MAGA
1303295091927326723 2020-09-08 04:32:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Boris, working great together!
1303294281327824898 2020-09-08 04:29:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great!
1303293439296053249 2020-09-08 04:25:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thanks Curt. Great pitcher!!!
1303292112075661313 2020-09-08 04:20:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....And because of weak and pathetic Democrat leadership, this thuggery is happening in other Democrat run cities and states. Must shut them down fast. Biden and his most Liberal in Senate running mate, Kamala, won’t even talk about it. They won’t utter the words, LAW &amp; ORDER!
1303292111136190465 2020-09-08 04:20:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> BLM Protesters horribly harass elderly Pittsburgh diners, scaring them with loud taunts while taking their food right off their plate. These Anarchists, not protesters, are Biden voters, but he has no control and nothing to say. Disgraceful. Never seen anything like it. Thugs!
1303156993847328771 2020-09-07 19:23:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Real Polls are starting to look GREAT! We will be having an even bigger victory than that of 2016. The Radical Left Anarchists, Agitators, Looters, and just plain Lunatics, will not be happy, but they will behave!
1303147729049325568 2020-09-07 18:46:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This guy is given the answer to questions, which he reads from his teleprompter. Is Donna  involved in this scam? Could you imagine if I got caught doing this. The media will never report this scam (FAKE) candidate. Sad!
1303140622946242560 2020-09-07 18:18:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Get Out and Vote for Corky Messner (@CorkyForSenate)!

1303105851130081280 2020-09-07 16:00:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News knows that Sleepy Joe doesn’t have a clue, and they want to protect his Radical Left Democrat enablers. He is so bad for the USA!
1303103464323649536 2020-09-07 15:50:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@CNN IS FAKE NEWS, and all smart people know that!

1303006236078637064 2020-09-07 09:24:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biggest &amp; Fastest Financial Recovery In History. Next year will be BEST EVER, unless a very Sleepy person becomes President and massively raises your taxes - In which case, CRASH!
1302996272249548807 2020-09-07 08:44:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just heard that Wacko John Bolton was talking of the fact that I discussed “love letters from Kim Jong Un” as though I viewed them as just that. Obviously, was just being sarcastic. Bolton was such a jerk!
1302972258034614273 2020-09-07 07:09:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Rochester N.Y., Brooklyn N.Y., Portland - All had bad nights, all weakly run by Radical Left Democrat Governors and Mayors! Get the picture?

1302968271306711046 2020-09-07 06:53:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Gordon Chang: China Seems ‘to Be Favoring Joe Biden‘ in Presidential Election  https://t.co/LmXVsqOJzP via @BreitbartNews. Of course they want Biden. I have taken $Billions from China and given it to our Farmers and U.S. Treasury. China would own the U.S. if Biden &amp; Hunter got in!
1302964489806139392 2020-09-07 06:38:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Will be having a Labor Day News Conference today at the White House, 1:00 P.M. Jobs number, and the Economic comeback, are looking GREAT. Happy Labor Day!
1302961482716639233 2020-09-07 06:26:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Starting to get VERY high marks in our handling of the Coronavirus (China Virus), especially when compared to other countries and areas of the world. Now the Vaccines (Plus) are coming, and fast!
1302769466804252673 2020-09-06 17:43:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A massive Disinformation Campaign is going on by the Democrats, their partner, the Fake News Media, &amp; Big Tech. They create false stories and then push them like has never been done before, even beyond the 2016 Campaign. It imperils our Country, and must stop now. Victory 2020!

1302700900272738305 2020-09-06 13:11:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Our Economy and Jobs are doing really well. Next Year will be a Record Setter. Stay Tuned!
1302684242971893760 2020-09-06 12:05:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Lunacy!
1302675943241199618 2020-09-06 11:32:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> These are the Democrats “peaceful protests”. Sick!
1302628942680068096 2020-09-06 08:25:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big Ten Football is looking really good, but may lose Michigan, Illinois, and Maryland because of those Governors’ ridiculous lack of interest or political support. They will play without them?
1302601868313538560 2020-09-06 06:37:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrats, together with the corrupt Fake News Media, have launched a massive Disinformation Campaign the likes of which has never been seen before. They will say anything, like their recent lies about me and the Military, and hope that it sticks... But #MAGA gets it!
1302586046551597061 2020-09-06 05:34:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Department of Education is looking at this. If so, they will not be funded!
1302585109246287872 2020-09-06 05:31:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrats know that they are creating havoc on Election night. This is what they want. WE WILL WIN!
1302554417816907781 2020-09-06 03:29:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....fix it, and fast. The current recipient has no chance, and won’t even try. As I have often said, Baltimore is last in everything, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE! Kimberly is fully Endorsed by me, something I do not do lightly. Take advantage of it and MAKE BALTIMORE GREAT!
1302554416952889345 2020-09-06 03:29:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....Baltimore will turn around, and I will help. Crime will go way down, money and jobs will pour in. Life will be MUCH better because Kimberly really cares. The Dems have had 100 years and they gave you nothing but heartache. Baltimore is the WORST IN NATION, Kimberly will..
1302554416088834048 2020-09-06 03:29:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Be smart Baltimore! You have been ripped off for years by the Democrats, &amp; gotten nothing but poverty &amp; crime. It will only get worse UNLESS YOU ELECT KIMBERLY KLACIK TO CONGRESS. She brings with her the power &amp; ECONOMIC STRENGTH OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. She works sooo hard....

1302339764218204160 2020-09-05 13:16:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Nancy Pelosi said she got “set up” by the owner (a very good one) of a beauty parlor. If so, how will she do in negotiations against President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia, or Kim Jong Un of North Korea. Not so well, I suspect, but far better than Joe Hiden’ would do!

1302222782583967745 2020-09-05 05:31:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....This reminds me of the Dirty Dossier, which was pushed hard by John McCain, &amp; then with a thud turned out to be a total fraud. So many other scams also. The Radical Far Left is VICIOUS, they will do or say anything to win. But they won’t, we will WIN, &amp; have four great years!
1302222781661220864 2020-09-05 05:31:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> You work so hard for the military, from completely rebuilding a depleted mess that was left by OBiden, to fixing a broken V.A. and fighting for large scale military pay raises, and then a slimeball reporter, maybe working with disgruntled people, makes up such a horrible charge..
1302218250533642242 2020-09-05 05:13:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Letters from so many coaches, athletes and others pushed hard for this. I agree, has done so much for so many!

1301893907295371266 2020-09-04 07:44:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Atlantic Magazine is dying, like most magazines, so they make up a fake story in order to gain some relevance.

1301638082484150272 2020-09-03 14:47:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Hiden’ gets off his airplane, grabs and shakes a rather stunned man’s hand (like in the old days), then touches his (Joe’s) face and mask with the same hand. No crowd, no enthusiasm for Joe today. Law &amp; Order!

1301587555301896194 2020-09-03 11:27:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Nancy Pelosi says she got “set up” by a Beauty Parlor owner. Maybe the Beauty Parlor owner should be running the House of Representatives instead of Crazy Nancy?
1301570802551324672 2020-09-03 10:20:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Crazy Nancy Pelosi said she was “set up” by the beauty parlor owner when she improperly had the salon opened (and didn’t wear a MASK!). Does anyone want a Speaker of the House who can be so easily SET UP?
1301540878381703168 2020-09-03 08:21:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Do you notice that any time Fake News Suppression Polls are put out, like @FoxNews, the Stock Market goes DOWN. We are going to WIN!

1301516949793505287 2020-09-03 06:46:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@NYGovCuomo should get his puppet New York prosecutors, who have been illegally after me and my family for years, to investigate his incompetent handling of the China Virus, and all of the deaths caused by this incompetence. It is at minimum a Nursing Home Scandal - 11,000 DEAD!
1301514116222287875 2020-09-03 06:35:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Sleepy Joe Hiden’ was acknowledged by his own people to have done a terrible job on a much easier situation, H1N1 Swine Flu. The OBiden Administration failed badly on this, &amp; now he sits back in his basement and criticizes every move we make on the China Virus. DOING GREAT JOB!
1301499699069882368 2020-09-03 05:38:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Governors Andrew Cuomo of New York has the worst record on death and China Virus. 11,000 people alone died in Nursing Homes because of his incompetence!

1301253108404613121 2020-09-02 13:18:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mayor Wheeler just got harassed out of his own home in Portland by so-called “friendly protesters”.

1301211884759199746 2020-09-02 10:34:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Will be landing shortly in the Great State of North Carolina. See you soon!
1301196763769057282 2020-09-02 09:34:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> When a Kennedy loses a Democrat Primary in Massachusetts, by a lot, it just shows how far LEFT that party has gone. Joe Hiden’ will never be able to hold them back. Life, 2nd A, Energy, Religion, Jobs and the Economy, would be totally obliterated!
1301165073583534081 2020-09-02 07:28:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Will soon be heading to Wilmington, North Carolina, and then will be going to Battleship North Carolina. Look forward to seeing all of my friends!
1301164041935749125 2020-09-02 07:24:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> 2016 was AMAZING, but we never had this kind of ENTHUSIASM!
1301163707540660224 2020-09-02 07:22:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We had FAR more people (many millions) watching us at the RNC than did Sleepy Joe and the DNC, and yet an ad just ran saying the opposite. This is what we’re up against. Lies. But we will WIN!
1301150012194332672 2020-09-02 06:28:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Beauty Parlor owner must really dislike Crazy Nancy Pelosi. Turning her in, on tape, is a really big deal. She probably treats him like she treats everyone else...And she strongly supported a Kennedy who just lost in, of all places, Massachusetts!
1301148373916024832 2020-09-02 06:22:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden is a Low Energy Candidate the likes of which we have never seen before. The last thing our country needs is a Low Energy Individual, especially when surrounded by High Energy Chess Players scattered all over the world. He’s back in his basement now - no schedule!
1301145978096025601 2020-09-02 06:12:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Crazy Nancy Pelosi is being decimated for having a beauty parlor opened, when all others are closed, and for not wearing a Mask - despite constantly lecturing everyone else. We will almost certainly take back the House, and send Nancy packing!
1301137855885070336 2020-09-02 05:40:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Seriously, is this what our great USA wants as its leader?
1301134325782638593 2020-09-02 05:26:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden is not on the side of Law Enforcement, and that was spectacularly evident on my very successful trip yesterday to Kenosha. We solved the problem quickly, and it was very much appreciated by the people of Wisconsin. Joe Biden wouldn’t know where to begin - a bad record!
1301097177054359552 2020-09-02 02:58:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Unsolicited Ballots Scam is their only hope. Will be the most corrupt election in history, by far!
1301096114578436097 2020-09-02 02:54:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Some things just don’t get any crazier. Just call me Kate, problem over!
1301095272039186432 2020-09-02 02:51:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is the NEW and very sick Democrat Party. We will win on November 3rd, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
1301094208967774208 2020-09-02 02:46:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> See, even a Kennedy isn’t safe in the new Radical Left Democrat Party. Taxes up big, no 2A. Biden has completely lost control. Pelosi strongly backed the loser!
1301092673240129536 2020-09-02 02:40:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We catch them all!
1301092327017140224 2020-09-02 02:39:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Like Fredo at Fake News @CNN, the very untalented Joy Reid should be fired for this horrible use of the words “Muslim Terrorists”. Such xenophobia and racism on MSDNC. Anyone else would be gone, and fast!!!
1301090370508464129 2020-09-02 02:31:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Will Fredo be fired by Fake News @CNN? He speaks with great disrespect about women, and it will only get worse. Fredo’s Ratings are bad, so this is the time. Always terrible to speak to sleazebags, especially when you are being recorded. CNN has no choice, Fredo must go!
1300983667561562118 2020-09-01 19:27:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mike Pence was never put on standby, &amp; there were no mini-strokes. This is just more Fake News by @CNN, a phony story. The reason for the visit to Walter Reed, together with the full press pool, was to complete my yearly physical. Short visit, then returned (with press) to W.H...
1300933256762798080 2020-09-01 16:07:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Kenosha, Wisconsin, we’re with you all the way!  https://t.co/Xs49PEu4AP
1300921475713597447 2020-09-01 15:20:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great honor, but think we are much higher than 46%. Hidden vote!
1300917361147629569 2020-09-01 15:04:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There has not. They are the Enemy of the People. TDS!
1300916103229526017 2020-09-01 14:59:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Not even a “minor” one. Thank you!
1300914658337910784 2020-09-01 14:53:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> True!
1300913237869752321 2020-09-01 14:47:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Drudge didn’t support me in 2016, and I hear he doesn’t support me now. Maybe that’s why he is doing poorly. His Fake News report on Mini-Strokes is incorrect. Possibly thinking about himself, or the other party’s “candidate”.
1300840191771340801 2020-09-01 09:57:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I was saddened to learn of the passing of India's former President, Pranab Mukherjee. I send my condolences to his family and the people of India as they grieve the loss of a great leader.
1300834747157897216 2020-09-01 09:35:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump>  https://t.co/iZcL0U92pZ
1300815396950478849 2020-09-01 08:18:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Had a very productive conversation with Kevin Warren, Commissioner of the Big Ten Conference, about immediately starting up Big Ten football. Would be good (great!) for everyone - Players, Fans, Country. On the one yard line!
1300813079366770689 2020-09-01 08:09:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Heading to Kenosha, Wisconsin, to thank Law Enforcement and the National Guard for a job well done. The Violence stopped six days ago, the moment the Guard entered the picture. Thank you!
1300811758051954695 2020-09-01 08:04:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> It never ends! Now they are trying to say that your favorite President, me, went to Walter Reed Medical Center, having suffered a series of mini-strokes. Never happened to THIS candidate - FAKE NEWS. Perhaps they are referring to another candidate from another Party!
1300796174207680512 2020-09-01 07:02:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Good luck to Sean Compton, a winner at everything he does!
1300778602301190144 2020-09-01 05:52:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are tired of watching the highly political @NBA. Basketball ratings are WAY down, and they won’t be coming back. I hope football and baseball are watching and learning because the same thing will be happening to them. Stand tall for our Country and our Flag!!!
1300640042105344001 2020-08-31 20:42:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden will also raise your taxes like never before. Sad!
1300639323436523520 2020-08-31 20:39:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Kimberly Klacik is really working hard to help the people of Baltimore. She is running for Congress as a Republican, &amp; if she wins she will be an inspiration to all. She is strong on inner city rebuilding, healthcare, our Military &amp; Vets. She has my Complete &amp; Total Endorsement!
1300630744759500807 2020-08-31 20:05:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> My son, Donald, just wrote a really important new book, “Liberal Privilege”, talking, with great knowledge, of our world today. Lets make him a number one bestseller, again! @DonaldJTrumpJr @seanhannity

1300503351101186048 2020-08-31 11:38:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just watched what Biden had to say. To me, he’s blaming the Police far more than he’s blaming the Rioters, Anarchists, Agitators, and Looters, which he could never blame or he would lose the Radical Left Bernie supports!
1300428396493758464 2020-08-31 06:41:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> LAW &amp; ORDER!
1300428128309907457 2020-08-31 06:40:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Radical Left Mayors &amp;  Governors of Cities where this crazy violence is taking place have lost control of their “Movement”. It wasn’t supposed to be like this, but the Anarchists &amp; Agitators got carried away and don’t listen anymore - even forced Slow Joe out of basement!
1300426765496725504 2020-08-31 06:34:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I’ve been getting really good polls, some over 50%, except for one Fake Poll done by @ABC NEWS, which gives NO INFORMATION about the sample, R or D, or anything else. They did this last Election, with one week to go, down 12 points, and I won. They are disgusting Fake News!
1300421406849671168 2020-08-31 06:13:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Portland is a mess, and it has been for many years. If this joke of a mayor doesn’t clean it up, we will go in and do it for them!
1300420725837266944 2020-08-31 06:10:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If I didn’t INSIST on having the National Guard activate and go into Kenosha, Wisconsin, there would be no Kenosha right now. Also, there would have been great death and injury. I want to thank Law Enforcement and the National Guard. I will see you on Tuesday!
1300267963254222854 2020-08-30 20:03:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just had a wonderful conversation with my friend, Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan, who will be leaving office soon. Shinzo will soon be recognized as the greatest Prime Minister in the history of Japan, whose relationship with the USA is the best it has ever been. Special man!
1300261079071830019 2020-08-30 19:36:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> When is Slow Joe Biden going to criticize the Anarchists, Thugs &amp; Agitators in ANTIFA? When is he going to suggest bringing up the National Guard in BADLY RUN &amp; Crime Infested Democrat Cities &amp; States? Remember, he can’t lose the Crazy Bernie Super Liberal vote!
1300258464170758144 2020-08-30 19:25:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....His problem is interesting. He must always be weak on CRIME because of the Bernie Sanders Radical Left voter. If he loses them, like Crooked Hillary did, he is “toast”, and many will vote for me because of TRADE (Bernie was good on trade). Joe MUST always be weak on crime!
1300258463298224129 2020-08-30 19:25:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden is coming out of the basement earlier than his hoped for ten days because his people told him he has no choice, his poll numbers are PLUNGING! Going to Pittsburgh, where I have helped industry to a record last year, &amp; then back to his  basement for an extended period...
1300195730527784960 2020-08-30 15:16:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Rushing him out of basement after seeing some very disturbing numbers. Don’t worry, he’ll go back to basement soon!
1300193398477946883 2020-08-30 15:07:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Rest In Peace Jay!
1300193033581928448 2020-08-30 15:05:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A weak and pathetic Democrat Mayor!!!
1300171130326716418 2020-08-30 13:38:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only way you will stop the violence in the high crime Democrat run cities is through strength!
1300170579048357894 2020-08-30 13:36:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ..The people of Portland, like all other cities &amp;  parts of our great Country, want Law &amp; Order. The Radical Left Democrat Mayors, like the dummy running Portland, or the guy right now in his basement unwilling to lead or even speak out against crime, will never be able to do it!
1300170578134003713 2020-08-30 13:36:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....He tried mixing with the Agitators and Anarchists and they mocked him. He would like to blame me and the Federal Government for going in, but he hasn’t seen anything yet. We have only been there with a small group to defend our U.S. Courthouse, because he couldn’t do it....
1300170576515026945 2020-08-30 13:36:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Ted Wheeler, the wacky Radical Left Do Nothing Democrat Mayor of Portland, who has watched great death and destruction of his City during his tenure, thinks this lawless situation should go on forever. Wrong! Portland will never recover with a fool for a Mayor....
1300041598449917953 2020-08-30 05:04:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> LAW &amp; ORDER!!!
1300038510687260673 2020-08-30 04:51:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@DNI_Ratcliffe on @MariaBartiromo this morning. @FoxNews
1300037695729737733 2020-08-30 04:48:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Moving along nicely. MAGA!

1300028625283092481 2020-08-30 04:12:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Their minds are gone!!!
1300027733293047810 2020-08-30 04:08:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@MayorBowser should arrest these agitators and thugs!Clean up D.C. or the Federal Government will do it for you. Enough!!! @MayorBowser
1300024113487138817 2020-08-30 03:54:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is where his crazed leaders are taking their puppet!
1300022913060556802 2020-08-30 03:49:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Lisa. Well stated!!!
1300020995630264320 2020-08-30 03:42:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you. We will not let them down!
1300020331147653121 2020-08-30 03:39:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Play Football Big Ten!
1300019849540886528 2020-08-30 03:37:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> GREAT PATRIOTS!
1300018396130611200 2020-08-30 03:31:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Democrat “Leadership” has no clue. Request help now....Problem Over!!!
1300015097218240512 2020-08-30 03:18:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wheeler is incompetent, much like Sleepy Joe Biden. This is not what our great Country wants. They want Safety &amp; Security, and do NOT want to Defund our Police!
1300010374855524352 2020-08-30 03:00:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The big backlash going on in Portland cannot be unexpected after 95 days of watching and incompetent Mayor admit that he has no idea what he is doing. The people of Portland won’t put up with no safety any longer.The Mayor is a FOOL. Bring in the National Guard!
1300007786101772288 2020-08-30 02:49:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Everything a Governor asked the Federal Government for with respect to the Pandemic, they got. They all said, on tape, the Federal government did a great job. Governor Cuomo used the word “phenomenal.” The Task Force worked well with the States. Feds bailed out many States!
1299899241360510978 2020-08-29 19:38:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> U.S. planning to cut military presence in Iraq -  https://t.co/d1MGNQ2QsA
1299893494669094912 2020-08-29 19:15:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The thugs who accosted Senator @RandPaul and his wonderful wife, Kelly, together with those who made threats to many other people who had just attended the Republican National Convention at the White House, must be sought out and immediately arrested. Well documented evidence!
1299878894531739650 2020-08-29 18:17:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just returned to Washington from Louisiana &amp; Texas, after tours and discussions concerning Hurricane Laura. Thank you to @FEMA and ALL. God bless the families of those who perished!
1299875840830910464 2020-08-29 18:05:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Probably Shifty Schiff, but others also, LEAK information to the Fake News. No matter what or who it is about, including China, these deranged lowlifes like the Russia, Russia, Russia narrative. Plays better for them. @DNI_Ratcliffe doing a great job!
1299845420932235264 2020-08-29 16:04:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch Mark Levin NOW on @FoxNews. Topic: Mail-In Voting!

1299750159958511622 2020-08-29 09:46:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....New Hampshire - and the big crowds - was great last night. Thank you! Heading now for Louisiana &amp; Texas to check out the damage done by Hurricane Laura. @FEMA &amp; @FEMA_Pete are, together with Law Enforcement and First Responders, doing a great job!
1299750156519129095 2020-08-29 09:46:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Now that Biden’s Polls are dropping fast, he has agreed to get out of his basement and start campaignin,“in ten days.” Sadly, that is a very slow reaction time for a President. Our beloved USA needs a much faster, smarter, and tougher response than that. Get out there today, Joe!
1299738340388990977 2020-08-29 08:59:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump>  https://t.co/CNH7hY8xWX
1299732426873135105 2020-08-29 08:35:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ..Even whether it’s dumb warmongers like John Bolton, social pretenders like Bob Woodward, who never has anything good to say, or an unstable niece, who was now rightfully shunned, scorned and mocked her entire life, and never even liked by her own very kind &amp; caring grandfather!
1299732423207301120 2020-08-29 08:35:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> About the only way a person is able to write a book on me is if they agree that it will contain as much bad “stuff” as possible, much of which is lies. It’s like getting a job with CNN or MSDNC and saying that “President Trump is great.” You have ZERO chance. FAKE NEWS!
1299688064969854977 2020-08-29 05:39:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I saved the Iron Range from the Obama Closure. We opened it up again, proudly. Also sent the National Guard the Minneapolis to squelch a big problem. It worked, and quickly!!!
1299686694380359680 2020-08-29 05:33:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Steve has my Complete and Total support. HE IS GREAT!

1299684861171687426 2020-08-29 05:26:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Dan has my Complete and Total Endorsement. We need Dan in Washington!
1299684210094071809 2020-08-29 05:23:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Bill is GREAT!
1299682591549911040 2020-08-29 05:17:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Another Democrat run city. They are a real mess!
1299681573713960960 2020-08-29 05:13:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News doesn’t want to report these numbers. The @latimes and others believed the Crooked Dems before the real numbers came out. Too bad we don’t have honest reporting when it comes to “Trump”. Phony sources, they say anything and think they get away with it. November 3rd.
1299679618111242243 2020-08-29 05:05:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great crowd, great people!
1299679053352513537 2020-08-29 05:03:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you!
1299678590750142464 2020-08-29 05:01:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> My Campaign, despite all of the Fake News, Fake Books, and pathetic reporting written about me and it, has more spirit and enthusiasm than ever before, including the great and wonderful Campaign of 2016!
1299676445128765440 2020-08-29 04:53:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Despite the Democrats views across TV and online lie (Con!), we had 147.9 million, the Republican National Convention blew the Democrat National Convention  AWAY. Not even close! Just like their lies on Russia, Football (PLAY!) and everything else! NOVEMBER 3rd.
1299673322775613440 2020-08-29 04:40:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrats see chaos as their way while President Trump sees the Rule of Law. Mayor @kenblackwell Thank you Ken!
1299575308442652672 2020-08-28 22:11:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Kenosha has been very quiet for the third night in a row or, since the National Guard has shown up. That’s the way it works, it’s all very simple. Portland, with a very ungifted mayor, should request help from the Federal Government. If lives are endangered, we’re going in!

1299562199837478913 2020-08-28 21:19:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Disgraceful that Big Ten is not playing football. Let them PLAY!
1299561148493242368 2020-08-28 21:14:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> How does the Fake News not include Online Streaming Numbers where Republicans blow the Dem Numbers away?
1299559244593860608 2020-08-28 21:07:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great total numbers for the Republican National Convention. Blows Democrat National Convention away. Also, much bigger fund raising numbers!

1299520405871316992 2020-08-28 18:33:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If the incompetent Mayor of Portland, Ted Wheeler, doesn’t get control of his city and stop the Anarchists, Agitators, Rioters and Looters, causing great danger to innocent people, we will go in and take care of matters the way they should have been taken care of 100 days ago!
1299518320714985475 2020-08-28 18:24:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Leading in Michigan, leading in Minnesota, leading all over. Sorry!

1299471584336330754 2020-08-28 15:19:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Landing in New Hampshire!
1299471313128452097 2020-08-28 15:17:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> No, I want Big Ten, and all other football, back - NOW. The Dems don’t want football back, for political reasons, but are trying to blame me and the Republicans. Another LIE, but this is what we are up against! They should also open up all of their Shutdown States.
1299452353662406656 2020-08-28 14:02:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Heading to New Hampshire!

1299391572384059397 2020-08-28 10:01:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Success: Since the National Guard moved into Kenosha, Wisconsin, two days ago, there has been NO FURTHER VIOLENCE, not even a small problem. When legally asked to help by local authorities, the Federal Government will act and quickly succeed. Are you listening Portland?
1299345147294109697 2020-08-28 06:56:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great Ratings &amp; Reviews Last Night. Thank you!

1299133174564491265 2020-08-27 16:54:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Democrats Hate that I called for Big Pharma to match the lowest prescription drug prices in the World by using a FAVORED NATIONS CLAUSE. Prices will plunge!
1299124203552210951 2020-08-27 16:18:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Democrats and Biden didn’t even mention the Anarchists, Agitators, Looters and so called “Peaceful Protesters” at their Convention. They will allow rampant crime, just as they do in Portland. If they ask us, as they must do, we will end crime in their Democrat run cities, FAST!
1299121427879276544 2020-08-27 16:07:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Ten Most Dangerous Cities in the U.S. are ALL run by Democrats, and this has gone on for DECADES!

1298671449968959490 2020-08-26 10:19:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will NOT stand for looting, arson, violence, and lawlessness on American streets. My team just got off the phone with Governor Evers who agreed to accept federal assistance (Portland should do the same!)...
1298655748466057217 2020-08-26 09:17:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hurricane Laura is a very dangerous and rapidly intensifying hurricane. My Administration remains fully engaged with state &amp; local emergency managers to continue preparing and assisting the great people Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. Listen to local officials. We are with you!  https://t.co/x0JoijLUpb
1298637609871212545 2020-08-26 08:05:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just In: Chinese State Media and Leaders of CHINA want Biden to win “the U.S. Election”.  If this happened (which it won’t), China would own our Country, and our Record Setting Stock Markets would literally CRASH!

1298414089769750530 2020-08-25 17:16:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Governor should call in the National Guard in Wisconsin. It is ready, willing, and more than able. End problem FAST!
1298404245629284354 2020-08-25 16:37:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> 80 Million Unsolicited Ballots are impossible for election centers to tabulate accurately. The Democrats know this better than anyone else. The fraud and abuse will be an embarrassment to our Country. Hopefully the Courts will stop this scam!
1298307828789194752 2020-08-25 10:14:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...They must stop calling these anarchists and agitators “peaceful protestors”. Come back into the real world! The Federal Government is ready to end this problem immediately upon your request.
1298307827837145088 2020-08-25 10:14:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We again request Kate Brown (@OregonGovBrown), the Governor of Oregon, and Mayor @TedWheeler of Portland, to call up the National Guard like should have been done 3 months ago...
1298296592764735490 2020-08-25 09:30:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am pleased to inform the American Public that Acting Secretary Chad Wolf will be nominated to be the Secretary of Homeland Security. Chad has done an outstanding job and we greatly appreciate his service!
1298283961551138817 2020-08-25 08:39:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...More JOBS from Eastport, Cutler, &amp; Jonesport to Stonington, Friendship, and Casco Bay. I am proud to help the great people of Maine!
1298283960494063616 2020-08-25 08:39:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Beautiful Maine Lobsters will now move tariff-free to Europe! For first time in many years. GREAT new deal by USTR levels playing field with Canada. Millions of $’s more in EXPORTS...
1298256297431666688 2020-08-25 06:49:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> For our Country to be sending 80 million UNSOLICITED BALLOTS is very unfair and a roadmap to disaster. Even recent small and easier to control elections which did this are a catastrophic disaster. Fraudulent &amp; missing Ballots like never seen before. 20% and 30% off. STOP!
1298236091313651715 2020-08-25 05:29:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Very appreciative that @CNN covered the vast majority of the Republican Convention last night. That was really good for CNN, while at the same time being good for our Country. Thank you!

1298029780437270530 2020-08-24 15:49:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden has said he would lock down the Country again. That’s crazy! We’re having record job growth and a booming stock market, but Joe would end it all and close it all down. Ridiculous!

1297922993021042688 2020-08-24 08:45:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All the Radical Left Democrats are trying to do with the Post Office hearings is blame the Republicans for the FRAUD that will occur because of the 51 Million Ballots that are being sent to people who have not even requested them. They are setting the table for a BIG MESS!
1297918034045100032 2020-08-24 08:25:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Incredible that @CNN &amp; MSDNC aren’t covering the Roll Call of States. Fake News! This is what the Republican Party is up against. Also, I’d like to hear the remarks of the Delegates from individual States, rather than @FoxNews anchors. Ridiculous!

1297605856712970246 2020-08-23 11:45:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Actually, I think I’m leading in the Polls!  @FoxNews @OANN
1297604008832573444 2020-08-23 11:37:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Chris Wallace “forgot” to ask a very weak and pathetic Schumer puppet, Senator Chrisie Coons, why Biden fought me when I put an extremely early BAN on people coming into our Country from heavily infected China. Biden later admitted I was right! But why no question?
1297601762384371719 2020-08-23 11:29:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Next we’ll turn to people of the Biden inner circle”, said by Chris Wallace of @FoxNews after unsuccessfully GRILLING Mark Meadows. Then all softball questions to a group of Biden lightweights, including Senator Chris Coons of Delaware.
1297587881607864326 2020-08-23 10:33:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Important White House News Conference at 5:30 (sharp) today. Very good news!

1297521970813317121 2020-08-23 06:11:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Two Democrat Caucus Meetings removed “UNDER GOD” from the Pledge of Allegiance. It sounded not only strange, but terrible. That’s where they’re coming from!
1297507346705522689 2020-08-23 05:13:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> These riots are an antigovernment movement from the Left that are all in Democrat run cities. The mayors have got to let their police do what they know how to do. Would be very easy to suppress or, call in the Federal Government. We will solve problem fast! @foxandfriends
1297495295266357248 2020-08-23 04:25:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So now the Democrats are using Mail Drop Boxes, which are a voter security disaster. Among other things, they make it possible for a person to vote multiple times. Also, who controls them, are they placed in Republican or Democrat areas? They are not Covid sanitized. A big fraud!
1297344504111017989 2020-08-22 18:26:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Now they’re trying to deny this, but they can’t!
1297331615564259328 2020-08-22 17:35:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@LouDobbs wrote a great new book, “The Trump Century, How Our President Changed the Course of History Forever”. Strongly recommended...A special guy!  https://t.co/ytLH14Thkr
1297329827859632130 2020-08-22 17:28:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A “Favored Nations Clause” against Big Pharma, which I signed last week, means that the USA gets a price on Prescription Drugs that matches the price of the Country that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World. 50%, 60%, maybe 70% reduction. No other President would do this!
1297305569758511105 2020-08-22 15:52:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Will be interviewed by @SteveHiltonx on @FoxNews. 9:00 P.M. Sunday Night. Enjoy!
1297296779520745476 2020-08-22 15:17:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Despite biggest ever job gains and a V shaped recovery, Joe Biden said, “I would shut it down”, referring to our Country. He has no clue!
1297293860754817024 2020-08-22 15:05:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We did Criminal Justice Reform without many politically motivated Democrats. The Black &amp; Hispanic community will remember this on November 3rd.
1297275241203458048 2020-08-22 13:51:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....that they are trying to pull off in violation of everything that our Country stands for. Vote NO to the Pelosi/ Schumer money wasting HOAX which is taking place now. Then fight the $51 million unasked for Ballots. Only ABSENTEE BALLOTS are acceptable!
1297275235432005632 2020-08-22 13:51:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Representatives of the Post Office have repeatedly stated that they DO NOT NEED MONEY, and will not make changes. This is all another HOAX by the Democrats to give 25 Billion unneeded dollars for political purposes,  without talking about the Universal Mail-In Ballot Scam....
1297152619526393856 2020-08-22 05:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In New Jersey they want you to certify that you asked for the Universal Mail-In Ballot that they sent you. But you never asked for it. Disaster in the wings!
1297148038385991680 2020-08-22 05:26:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many doctors and studies disagree with this!
1297138862108663808 2020-08-22 04:49:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics. Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Must focus on speed, and saving lives! @SteveFDA
1297138033918173184 2020-08-22 04:46:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why would Suburban Women vote for Biden and the Democrats when Democrat run cities are now rampant with crime (and they aren’t asking the Federal Government for help) which could easily spread to the suburbs, and they will reconstitute, on steroids, their low income suburbs plan!
1297135664069214208 2020-08-22 04:36:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden and the Democrats have greatly disrespected the Great State of Wisconsin by not even paying a small visit to Milwaukee, the designated site of the DNC. The State &amp; City worked very hard to make sure things would be good. Not nice. Vote Trump Wisconsin!
1297132096448864258 2020-08-22 04:22:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrats took the word GOD out of the Pledge of Allegiance at the Democrat National Convention. At first I thought they made a mistake, but it wasn’t. It was done on purpose. Remember Evangelical Christians, and ALL, this is where they are coming from-it’s done. Vote Nov 3!
1297130026857627649 2020-08-22 04:14:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Another bad night of Rioting in Portland, Oregon. A small number of Federal troops there to protect courthouse and other Federal property only (great job!). Wanting to be asked by City &amp; State to STOP THE RIOTS. Would bring in National Guard, end problem immediately. ASK!

1296645682875506688 2020-08-20 20:09:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In 47 years, Joe did none of the things of which he now speaks. He will never change, just words!

1296636041017925633 2020-08-20 19:31:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> After the worst debate performance in the history of politics, Michael Bloomberg, commonly known as Mini Mike, is trying to make a comeback by begging the Democrats for relevance. They treated him like a dog - and always will. Before politics, he said GREAT things about me!
1296610840033087488 2020-08-20 17:51:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 9:00 P.M. Enjoy!  @FoxNews
1296608655228502016 2020-08-20 17:42:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> To get into the Democrat National Convention, you must have an ID card with a picture...Yet the Democrats refuse to do this when it come to your very important VOTE! Gee, I wonder WHY???
1296601698891374593 2020-08-20 17:15:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They are sending out 51,000,000 Ballots to people who haven’t even requested a Ballot. Many of those people don’t even exist. They are trying to STEAL this election. This should not be allowed!
1296597150181330944 2020-08-20 16:57:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrats are demanding Mail-In Ballots because the enthusiasm meter for Slow Joe Biden is the lowest in recorded history, and they are concerned that very few people will turn out to vote. Instead, they will search &amp; find people, then “harvest” &amp; return Ballots. Not fair!

1296413178566410241 2020-08-20 04:46:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Sarah is correct. McCain was a lousy candidate with lots of bad policy, but the “deadheads” sabotaged his campaign from the inside, and never gave him a chance to win. Hope they were happy with OBiden, who gave you me!

Even the most Liberal friends that I have are thinking twice about voting Democrat this time because they’ve seen what’s happened to the City under @NYCMayor de Blasio and the State under @NYGovCuomo - They’re getting eaten up by taxes.” @DavidAsmanfox
1296219101623459841 2020-08-19 15:54:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Welcome, Barack and Crooked Hillary. See you on the field of battle!  https://t.co/ZrTKXcc6aU

1296198517573201923 2020-08-19 14:33:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Will be having a Press Conference at 5:45 P.M. See you in 15 minutes!
1296104752284082176 2020-08-19 08:20:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why are Republicans allowing the Democrats to have ridiculous Post Office hearings on Saturday &amp; Monday, just before and during our Convention. Let them hold them NOW (during their Convention) or after our Convention is over. Always playing right into their hands! @senatemajldr
1296092859226042368 2020-08-19 07:33:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Don’t buy GOODYEAR TIRES - They announced a BAN ON MAGA HATS. Get better tires for far less! (This is what the Radical Left Democrats do. Two can play the same game, and we have to start playing it now!).
1296084723165470721 2020-08-19 07:00:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> With what I am doing in the fight with the Drug Companies, drug prices will be coming down 50, 60, and even 70 per cent. The Democrats are fighting hard to stop me with big ad buys, plus. Likewise, Big Pharma. FAVORED NATIONS AND REBATES ARE BRINGING PRICES DOWN NOW. We will win!
1296079095479050241 2020-08-19 06:38:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> IF YOU CAN PROTEST IN PERSON, YOU CAN VOTE IN PERSON!
1295943677181927424 2020-08-18 21:40:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Senate Intelligence Panel found absolutely no evidence of collusion. There was no evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government to influence 2016, affirming the findings of other investigations.” Daily Caller
1295941701555687424 2020-08-18 21:32:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big win Matt!
1295930978582568963 2020-08-18 20:49:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Kimberly will work with the Trump Administration and we will bring Baltimore back, and fast. Don’t blow it Baltimore, the Democrats have destroyed your city!
1295920309946777600 2020-08-18 20:07:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great WIN Anna! Watched your race from beginning, very impressed. Your next opponent, Charlie Crist, is a Pelosi puppet who is bad on Crime, our Military, Vets, &amp; 2nd Amendment. You have my Complete &amp; Total Endorsement!
1295897125507670017 2020-08-18 18:35:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Tell the Dems that we have more Cases because we do FAR more Testing than any other Country!
1295855291523723264 2020-08-18 15:49:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@Amazon, and others in that business, should be charged (by the U.S. Postal System) much more per package, and the Post Office would be immediately brought back to “good health”, now vibrant, with ALL jobs saved. No pass on to customers. Get it done!

1295792202526973952 2020-08-18 11:38:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...Meanwhile, I gave America energy independence in fact, so much energy we could never use it all. The Bernie/Biden/AOC Green New Deal plan would take California’s failed policies to every American!
1295792201134256129 2020-08-18 11:38:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In California, Democrats have intentionally implemented rolling blackouts — forcing Americans in the dark. Democrats are unable to keep up with energy demand...

1295777044765143040 2020-08-18 10:38:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrats have to start enforcing Law and Order in their cities and states. New York City, Chicago and Portland are a total DISASTER!

1295744066466934784 2020-08-18 08:27:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People forget how divided our Country was under ObamaBiden. The anger and hatred were unbelievable. They shouldn’t be lecturing to us. I’m here, as your President, because of them!
1295702666903945217 2020-08-18 05:42:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Kasich did a bad job in Ohio, ran for President and was easy to beat, and now went to the other side desperate for relevance. Good Job by Chris C in exposing yet another loser!
1295699653753745408 2020-08-18 05:30:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many thousands of people work for our government. With that said, a former DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE named Miles Taylor, who I do not know (never heard of him), said he left &amp; is on the open arms Fake News circuit. Said to be a real “stiff”. They will take anyone against us!
1295680975184310272 2020-08-18 04:16:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The ObamaBiden Administration was the most corrupt in history, including the fact that they got caught SPYING ON MY CAMPAIGN, the biggest political scandal in the history of our Country. It’s called Treason, and more. Thanks for your very kind words Michelle!
1295679412365594625 2020-08-18 04:10:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Looking back into history, the response by the ObamaBiden team to the H1N1 Swine Flu was considered a weak and pathetic one. Check out the polling, it’s really bad. The big difference is that they got a free pass from the Corrupt Fake News Media!
1295677038301523968 2020-08-18 04:00:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....My Administration and I built the greatest economy in history, of any country, turned it off, saved millions of lives, and now am building an even greater economy than it was before. Jobs are flowing, NASDAQ is already at a record high, the rest to follow. Sit back &amp; watch!
1295677035466162177 2020-08-18 04:00:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Somebody please explain to @MichelleObama that Donald J. Trump would not be here, in the beautiful White House, if it weren’t for the job done by your husband, Barack Obama. Biden was merely an afterthought, a good reason for that very late &amp;  unenthusiastic endorsement.....
1295569697866473473 2020-08-17 20:54:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you. Will never let you down!
1295562738400362497 2020-08-17 20:26:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Now AP estimates that the real Cuomo number of people killed because of his total incompetence is 11,000, not the 6000 that was originally thought!
1295557963516698624 2020-08-17 20:07:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Cuomo, just like his brother Fredo, has not got a very good memory!
1295548611699322882 2020-08-17 19:30:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A proposal by Pentagon officials to slash Military Healthcare by $2.2 billion dollars has been firmly and totally rejected by me. We will do nothing to hurt our great Military professionals &amp; heroes as long as I am your President. Thank you!
1295507087166857216 2020-08-17 16:45:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> She was fired because she was boring and never had what it took. Perhaps that has proven to be a mistake!
1295504964379242498 2020-08-17 16:37:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why would @FoxNews put on phony Congresswoman @RepDebDingell. A total waste of airtime!
1295462969313120256 2020-08-17 13:50:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> NEW RECORD FOR NASDAQ!
1295454897689604097 2020-08-17 13:18:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> SAVE THE POST OFFICE!
1295454264412667904 2020-08-17 13:15:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why is Congress scheduled to meet (on Post Office) next Monday, during the Republican Convention, rather than now, while the Dems are having their Convention. They are always playing games. GET TOUGH REPUBLICANS!!!
1295452178010615808 2020-08-17 13:07:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great division between the Bernie Sanders crowd and the other Radical Lefties. Our Country would be destroyed!
1295429559127429120 2020-08-17 11:37:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just landed in Mankato, Minnesota!
1295428543359287296 2020-08-17 11:33:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just approved (and fast) the FULL Emergency Declaration for the Great State of Iowa. They got hit hard by record setting winds. Thank you to @SenJoniErnst, @ChuckGrassley, and Governor Kim Reynolds.
1295407324086128641 2020-08-17 10:09:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> What’s with @CNN POLLS increasing me by 10 points in a short period of time. Maybe they want to take over from @FoxNews!
1295407319694680066 2020-08-17 10:09:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Getting ready to land in Minneapolis. Our great National Guard saved the city from further destruction. Should have been called up sooner by local government!
1295396978482802691 2020-08-17 09:28:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The U.S. Post Office (System) has been failing for many decades. We simply want to MAKE THE POST OFFICE GREAT AGAIN, while at the same time saving billions of dollars a year for American Taxpayers. Dems don’t have a clue! @USPostOffice911
1295385113862090753 2020-08-17 08:40:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Some states use “drop boxes” for the collection of Universal Mail-In Ballots. So who is going to “collect” the Ballots, and what might be done to them prior to tabulation? A Rigged Election? So bad for our Country. Only Absentee Ballots acceptable!
1295320924938481667 2020-08-17 04:25:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends this morning at 8:00 A.M. Enjoy!
1295167020951056384 2020-08-16 18:14:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great going Jim. Proud of you!
1295165122974015495 2020-08-16 18:06:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Law and Order. If @NYCMayor can’t do it, we will!
1295067517283598336 2020-08-16 11:38:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Franklin!
1295065684788088833 2020-08-16 11:31:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “If carefully done, according to the guidelines, there is no reason why you shouldn’t be able to do that (vote at polling place).” Doctor Anthony Fauci
1295050523742175233 2020-08-16 10:31:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@FoxNews is not watchable during weekend afternoons. It is worse than Fake News @CNN. I strongly suggest turning your dial to @OANN. They do a really “Fair &amp; Balanced” job!
1294731865459437571 2020-08-15 13:25:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Voter Scam!
1294731591030378497 2020-08-15 13:24:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The honorable thing to do is drop the Mail-In Scam before it is too late! Absentee Ballots, like they have in Florida, are good!
1294731080264810497 2020-08-15 13:21:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> News Conference at 5:30 P.M. Enjoy!
1294728590773428225 2020-08-15 13:12:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If Obama did this, they would speak of nothing else. Biden could NEVER do it!
1294728043257376771 2020-08-15 13:09:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you!
1294727959706730498 2020-08-15 13:09:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Would be terrible for our Country!
1294727270159069186 2020-08-15 13:06:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More Fake News!

1294658967944265728 2020-08-15 08:35:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great work by the Governors of AZ, IA, LA, and NM (@DougDucey @IAGovernor @LouisianaGov &amp; @GovMLG) who responded to my Executive Action and promptly submitted applications, that we APPROVED QUICKLY, to support Americans out of work because of the ChinaVirus. More states to come!
1294612940776185856 2020-08-15 05:32:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So true, but we won’t let that happen!
1294598510885638151 2020-08-15 04:35:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Very strange. Sleepy Joe never takes questions. Also, his reporters have zero drive. Why can’t my reporters behave like that? Something is going on!
1294595814254415872 2020-08-15 04:24:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you to the great Pat Lynch &amp; the @NYCPBA. I will never let you down!
1294487623285837824 2020-08-14 21:14:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will bring safety to our cities.

1294400686772420609 2020-08-14 15:29:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The biggest difference between the Presidential Race in 2020 and that of 2016 is the 2016 candidate, Crooked Hillary Clinton, was much smarter and sharper than Slow  Joe, we have even more ENTHUSIASM now, and @FoxNews has become politically correct and no longer the big deal!
1294397381073678339 2020-08-14 15:15:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I promised YOU I would not take a dime of salary as your President. I donate the entire $400,000!

1293937894525227013 2020-08-13 08:50:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The world will be laughing and taking full advantage of the United States if Joe Biden ever became President. Our Country would COLLAPSE!  https://t.co/lxcyxYL9YC

1293909392459350019 2020-08-13 06:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Drug companies, which are being forced by me to substantially reduce Drug Prices, are taking $millions in ads saying I want to increase Medicare Primiums. Wrong, just the opposite! These ads show DRUG PRICES ARE GOING DOWN, and they are not happy! False advertising!
1293869227036811265 2020-08-13 04:17:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media is giving @KamalaHarris a free pass despite her Radical Left failures and very poor run in the Democrat Primary. There was nobody meaner or more condescending to Slow Joe, not even me, and yet she quickly evaporated down to almost zero in the polls. Bad!
1293861034009268224 2020-08-13 03:44:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Very poor morning TV ratings for MSDNC’s Morning Joe, headed by a complete Psycho named Joe Scarborough and his ditzy airhead wife, Mika, and also @CNN, headed by complete unknowns. Congratulations to @foxandfriends on dominating the mornings (thank you President Trump!).

1293520377952567307 2020-08-12 05:11:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watched @billmaher last week for the first time in a long time. He’s totally SHOT, looks terrible, exhausted, gaunt, and weak. If there was ever a good reason for no shutdown, check out this jerk. He never had much going for him, but whatever he did have is missing in action!
1293517514798960640 2020-08-12 04:59:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The “suburban housewife” will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Corey Booker in charge! @foxandfriends @MariaBartiromo
1293513735533924352 2020-08-12 04:44:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> 96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you! Also, leading in most swing states!
1293510853074051073 2020-08-12 04:33:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@KamalaHarris started strong in the Democrat Primaries, and finished weak, ultimately fleeing the race with almost zero support. That’s the kind of opponent everyone dreams of!

1293163818282094594 2020-08-11 05:34:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big Stock Market Numbers!
1293163704188645385 2020-08-11 05:33:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More Testing, which is a good thing (we have the most in the world), equals more Cases, which is Fake News Gold. They use Cases to demean the incredible job being done by the great men &amp; women of the U.S. fighting the China Plague!
1293151454069391360 2020-08-11 04:45:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ..so called American Intelligence were Dirty Cops who have now proven to be sleazebags at the highest level like James Comey, proven liar James Clapper, &amp; perhaps the lowest of them all, Wacko John Brennan who headed the CIA, you could perhaps understand my reluctance to embrace!
1293151453029322753 2020-08-11 04:45:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton, one of the dumbest people I’ve met in government and sadly, I’ve met plenty, states often that I respected, and even trusted, Vladimir Putin of Russia more than those in our Intelligence Agencies. While of course that is not true, if the first people you met from....

So many good stories by someone who, unlike most other so called writers, was actually there, and a part of the action - of which there was plenty. Go buy this book, a job well done!
1293141671509659650 2020-08-11 04:06:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great new book by former Director of Oval Office Operations, Madeleine Westerhout, entitled “Off the Record”.

1292872318562205699 2020-08-10 10:15:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We have narrowed the Presidential Nomination Acceptance Speech, to be delivered on the final night of the Convention (Thursday), to two locations - The Great Battlefield of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and the White House, Washington, D.C. We will announce the decision soon!
1292838130526158848 2020-08-10 08:00:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you to Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana for his very smart words on the just signed Executive Orders!
1292837084152107010 2020-08-10 07:55:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Portland, which is out of control, should finally, after almost 3 months, bring in the National Guard. The Mayor and Governor are putting people’s lives at risk. They will be held responsible. The Guard is ready to act immediately. The Courthouse is secured by Homeland!
1292832946077007886 2020-08-10 07:39:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RINO Ben Sasse, who needed my support and endorsement in order to get the Republican nomination for Senate from the GREAT State of Nebraska, has, now that he’s got it (Thank you President T), gone rogue, again. This foolishness plays right into the hands of the Radical Left Dems!
1292810574603202565 2020-08-10 06:10:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So now Schumer and Pelosi want to meet to make a deal. Amazing how it all works, isn’t it. Where have they been for the last 4 weeks when they were “hardliners”, and only wanted BAILOUT MONEY for Democrat run states and cities that are failing badly? They know my phone number!
1292638186842337281 2020-08-09 18:45:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@Scaramucci, who just made a fool of himself as he got taken apart by @SteveHiltonx, only lasted 11 days in his favorite of all time Administration, before being fired for, again, making a fool of himself. Anthony is a loser who begged to come back. I said “No Thanks”.
1292628590425759747 2020-08-09 18:07:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is Fake News by the failing @nytimes &amp; bad ratings @CNN. Never suggested it although, based on all of the many things accomplished during the first 3 1/2 years, perhaps more than any other Presidency, sounds like a good idea to me!

1291842540023558146 2020-08-07 14:03:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Pelosi and Schumer only interested in Bailout Money for poorly run Democrat cities and states. Nothing to do with China Virus! Want one trillion dollars. No interest. We are going a different way!

1291722355471941633 2020-08-07 06:06:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> After yesterday’s statement, Sleepy Joe Biden is no longer worthy of the Black Vote!
1291718731224305670 2020-08-07 05:51:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is the biggest political crime and scandal in American history. Hopefully, for the good of our Country, it is coming soon!

1291339436727382016 2020-08-06 04:44:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> How can voters be sending in Ballots starting, in some cases, one month before the First Presidential Debate. Move the First Debate up. A debate, to me, is a Public Service. Joe Biden and I owe it to the American People!
1291228757437579264 2020-08-05 21:25:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Two wonderful people!
1291224128427642882 2020-08-05 21:06:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Sally Yates is either lying or grossly incompetent. It is not possible she could have known so little about Dirty Cop James Comey (and others) from her high position in the Department of “Justice”. The political Crime of the Century, and she had no idea what they were doing?
1291220257416282115 2020-08-05 20:51:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A very big CONGRATULATIONS to the great @seanhannity on having the Number One Book on the Planet, “Live Free Or Die”. The book is fantastic, and so true. Keep Sean Number One!
1291166830946656259 2020-08-05 17:18:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Cities across the Nation that are run by Democrats are in shambles.” Matt Walsh  @TuckerCarlson
1291144294259200000 2020-08-05 15:49:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congressman Scott DesJarlais (@tndesjarlais) has been a tremendous advocate for Tennessee! One of my earliest supporters, he fights for our Military, Vets, Law Enforcement and the Second Amendment! Scott has my Complete and Total Endorsement! #TN04  https://t.co/ffydSSVnGL
1291117659086561280 2020-08-05 14:03:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> DRAIN THE SWAMP!  https://t.co/68M4sN7LLD
1291074236992323590 2020-08-05 11:10:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> BIG NEWS! The Political Crime of the Century is unfolding. ObamaBiden illegally spied on the Trump Campaign, both before and after the election. Treason!
1291073985107693568 2020-08-05 11:09:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Every time you see a negative Big Pharma commercial against me remember, it means your drug prices are coming way down!

1291015075541786624 2020-08-05 07:15:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Sally Yates has zero credibility. She was a part of the greatest political crime of the Century, and ObamaBiden knew EVERYTHING! Sally Yates leaked the General Flynn conversation? Ask her under oath. Republicans should start playing the Democrats game!
1291012543419482113 2020-08-05 07:05:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@CNN has no sources on the Task Force. Their “sources” are made up, pure fiction! Jim Acosta is a Fake reporter!
1290967953542909952 2020-08-05 04:08:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Nevada has ZERO infrastructure for Mail-In Voting. It will be a corrupt disaster if not ended by the Courts. It will take months, or years, to figure out. Florida has built a great infrastructure, over years, with two great Republican Governors. Florida, send in your Ballots!
1290958442857926656 2020-08-05 03:30:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
1290957656321073152 2020-08-05 03:27:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy!
1290956691488612358 2020-08-05 03:23:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> NASA was Closed &amp; Dead until I got it going again. Now it is the most vibrant place of its kind on the Planet...And we have Space Force to go along with it. We have accomplished more than any Administration in first 3 1/2 years. Sorry, but it all doesn’t happen with Sleepy Joe!
1290954271140216833 2020-08-05 03:14:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> For those that thought I wasn’t into the Environment, this is the biggest bill ever passed, by far. I wonder if this will silence the Fake News? Probably not!
1290952940602130437 2020-08-05 03:09:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great race run by Roger against a very tough and smart opponent. Roger loves Kansas and will represent it incredibly well. He has my Complete and Total Endorsement. Will be a Big Win on November 3rd. This is not the opponent the Democrats wanted!
1290949993600294913 2020-08-05 02:57:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is TREMENDOUS Lawlessness in America’s Liberal Cities. Would be so easy to stop but they have a clouded vision of what should be done. They are indoctrinated with a philosophy which will never work, a philosophy which would destroy America. Portland would be the norm!
1290794273261133824 2020-08-04 16:38:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump>  https://t.co/JDS4zUXXJG
1290784892469555201 2020-08-04 16:01:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great meeting today with the CoronaVirus Task Force in the Oval Office. Stay informed at:  https://t.co/p9j7kZsD7b.  https://t.co/nnnUHCzOLV
1290741980813824005 2020-08-04 13:10:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THE WALL STREET JOURNAL  “Trump Wins in Portland”  “Something big has changed in Portland, Ore. After weeks of chaos and flames outside the city’s federal courthouse, the past few days have seen the violence subside dramatically. What happened?” William McGurn @WSJ
1290730748132167681 2020-08-04 12:26:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am deeply saddened by the tragic loss of eight Marines and one Sailor during a training exercise off the coast of California. Our prayers are with their families. I thank them for the brave service their loved ones gave to our Nation. #SemperFidelis
1290727631114166272 2020-08-04 12:13:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Today we celebrated the passage of landmark legislation that will preserve America’s majestic natural wonders, priceless historic treasures, grand national monuments, and glorious national parks. It was my great honor to sign the Great American Outdoors Act into law! #HR1957  https://t.co/KxDgpidQH2
1290692768675901440 2020-08-04 09:55:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Whether you call it Vote by Mail or Absentee Voting, in Florida the election system is Safe and Secure, Tried and True. Florida’s Voting system has been cleaned up (we defeated Democrats attempts at change), so in Florida I encourage all to request a Ballot &amp; Vote by Mail! #MAGA
1290687393293631489 2020-08-04 09:33:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump>  https://t.co/KimkBKBhX5
1290648990242004992 2020-08-04 07:01:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big Pharma is taking ads against me because I am MASSIVELY lowering your drug prices, which is obviously not good for them. Medicare premiums will also be going down. I am the first President to take them on. Don’t fall for their false ads. Biden plan is for very big increases!
1290638211354693632 2020-08-04 06:18:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Happy 230th Birthday @USCG!!  https://t.co/QsUJsWbmDh
1290623558461411333 2020-08-04 05:20:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not happy that players are not standing for our National Anthem!
1290488364362170371 2020-08-03 20:22:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> OPEN THE SCHOOLS!!!
1290308363872538624 2020-08-03 08:27:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> My visits last week to Texas and Florida had massive numbers of cheering people gathered along the roads and highways, thousands and thousands, even bigger (by far) than the crowds of 2016. Saw no Biden supporters, and yet some in the Fake News said it was an equal number. Sad!
1290283634130214913 2020-08-03 06:49:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RECORD HIGH NASDAQ! It would all come crashing down, including your Jobs, Stocks, and 401k’s, if Sleepy Joe ever became President. China and others would own us!!!
1290282508303716352 2020-08-03 06:44:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So Crazy Nancy Pelosi said horrible things about Dr. Deborah Birx, going after her because she was too positive on the very good job we are doing on combatting the China Virus, including Vaccines &amp; Therapeutics. In order to counter Nancy, Deborah took the bait &amp; hit us. Pathetic!
1290270589945430016 2020-08-03 05:57:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Really bad TV Ratings for Morning Joe (@JoeNBC). @foxandfriends doing great, leading all others by far. @CNN not a factor!!!
1290261807282757632 2020-08-03 05:22:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> 96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. 50% in new Rasmussen Poll (higher than Obama at this point in time). Thank you!
1290257055534551043 2020-08-03 05:03:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Cases up because of BIG Testing! Much of our Country is doing very well. Open the Schools!
1290253369404092417 2020-08-03 04:49:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> FAKE NEWS IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
1290252674777133057 2020-08-03 04:46:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> With the exception of New York &amp; a few other locations, we’ve done MUCH better than most other Countries in dealing with the China Virus. Many of these countries are now having a major second wave. The Fake News is working overtime to make the USA (&amp; me) look as bad as possible!
1290250416278532096 2020-08-03 04:37:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In an illegal late night coup, Nevada’s clubhouse Governor made it impossible for Republicans to win the state. Post Office could never handle the Traffic of Mail-In Votes without preparation. Using Covid to steal the state. See you in Court!
1290097359204913152 2020-08-02 18:29:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump>  https://t.co/h5bAKu6Xws
1290011585587666946 2020-08-02 12:48:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....and ruined. The Federal Government must again seek the Death Penalty in a do-over of that chapter of the original trial. Our Country cannot let the appellate decision stand. Also, it is ridiculous that this process is taking so long!
1290011569657610240 2020-08-02 12:48:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Rarely has anybody deserved the death penalty more than the Boston Bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The court agreed that this “was one of the worst domestic terrorist attacks since the 9/11 atrocities”. Yet the appellate court tossed out the death sentence. So many lives lost....
1290002828203667458 2020-08-02 12:13:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump>  https://t.co/s8DJb1LxQW
1289999271664787463 2020-08-02 11:59:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Astronauts complete first splashdown in 45 years. Very exciting!
1289997897723863040 2020-08-02 11:54:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great to have NASA Astronauts return to Earth after very successful two month mission. Thank you to all!
1289894127778377728 2020-08-02 05:01:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> When you see the Drug Companies taking massive  television ads against me, forget what they say (which is false), YOU KNOW THAT DRUG PRICES ARE COMING DOWN, BIG. Favored Nations Clause means USA will pay the lowest price of any nation in the World. Never done before. Watch!!!
1289887533250351110 2020-08-02 04:35:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big China Virus breakouts all over the World, including nations which were thought to have done a great job. The Fake News doesn’t report this. USA will be stronger than ever before, and soon!
1289877179791110144 2020-08-02 03:54:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Was in the Great State of Texas this week and explained that the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats, headed up by their great leader, Sleepy Joe Biden (who never leaves his basement), are strongly against “Oil, Gas, Guns, &amp; God”. Must be tough to win Texas on that platform!
1289873585318899712 2020-08-02 03:40:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Madison is a star who loves the USA and his Great State, North Carolina. Will fight for Military, Vets, 2nd Amendment, Lower Taxes &amp; Regulations. He is a winner who has my Complete &amp; Total Endorsement!
1289870016272166913 2020-08-02 03:25:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> That’s because it is mostly FAKE NEWS!
1289863070836121601 2020-08-02 02:58:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hunter - Meadow is proud of you. So am I. Congratulations!
1289858922690621440 2020-08-02 02:41:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is outrageous. Must be met with immediate litigation! @GOPChairwoman
1289776166174248960 2020-08-01 21:12:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Death penalty! He killed and badly wounded many. Justice!

1289731760838721536 2020-08-01 18:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big flare ups in Europe. Fake News USA doesn’t like talking about this!
1289674638285447168 2020-08-01 14:29:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Biden to raise taxes by 3 Trillion Dollars.” Actually, it will be much more than that, and much of it on nonsense. Markets and your 401k’s will CRASH. Jobs will disappear!
1289657702608547840 2020-08-01 13:22:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Very excited to see @SeanHannity’s long awaited new book, 'Live Free or Die: America (and the World) on the Brink' which will be released on Tuesday, August 4th.

Thanks so much John – greatly appreciate your support and words of wisdom!  https://t.co/QAdxcK33Su
1289646330361470977 2020-08-01 12:37:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I actually agree with this. Too much income disparity. Changes must be made, and soon!
1289644402906763265 2020-08-01 12:29:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Peggy Noonan, a “Concast” MSDNC @WSJ puppet, doesn’t have a clue, and hasn’t for many years. Never got the “Trump thing”. She plays right into the hands of the stupid people!
1289639829810999297 2020-08-01 12:11:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Payroll Tax Cut plus Dollars!
1289636367283232768 2020-08-01 11:57:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Jake, this wasn’t a Trump Rally, but rather a very successful gathering of the great Sheriffs and Law Enforcement (of Florida) who gave me their unequivocal ENDORSEMENT. No Defund the Police here. Best Wishes!
1289633359681839105 2020-08-01 11:45:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! We have more cases because we have tested far more than any other country, 60,000,000. If we tested less, there would be less cases. How did Italy, France &amp; Spain do? Now Europe sadly has flare ups. Most of our governors worked hard &amp; smart. We will come back STRONG!  ::
1289408673324777472 2020-07-31 20:52:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Homeland Security is not leaving Portland until local police complete cleanup of Anarchists and Agitators!
1289407195029762049 2020-07-31 20:46:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Obama worked harder for Hillary Clinton and the losing Clinton Campaign than she worked for herself! Now he’s working with Sleepy Joe - will be same result. MAGA is energized like never before!
1289397528639791104 2020-07-31 20:08:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We have more Cases because we do more Testing. It’s Lamestream Media Gold!
1289358246541553664 2020-07-31 17:32:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We beat Obama 4 years ago, he worked harder than Crooked Hillary, and we’ll do it again!
1289353615224668160 2020-07-31 17:13:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I’m with you all the way, thank you!  https://t.co/JL15Lh7I7A

1289312630608465920 2020-07-31 14:31:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am thrilled to be back in my home state of Florida—and honored to receive the endorsement of dozens of incredible Florida Sheriffs, THANK YOU! #LESM  https://t.co/THl3IUf19Y
1289284178127646720 2020-07-31 12:37:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrats are holding back the $1,200 to $3,400 (family of four) checks that were ready to be sent out!
1289283987718828032 2020-07-31 12:37:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Very disappointed in @SenSchumer for blocking the temporary extension of the $600 unemployment benefits. The Do Nothing Democrats are more interested in playing politics than in helping our deserving people. DRAIN THE SWAMP ON NOVEMBER 3RD!
1289283091635122176 2020-07-31 12:33:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Pelosi &amp; Schumer blocked desperately needed unemployment payments, which is so terrible, especially since they fully understand that it was not the workers fault that they are unemployed, it’s the fault of China!
1289282585718190080 2020-07-31 12:31:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Pelosi &amp; Schumer have no interest in making a deal that is good for our Country and our People. All they want is a trillion dollars, and much more, for their Radical Left Governed States, most of which are doing very badly. It is called a BAILOUT for many years of bad Dem Mgmt!
1289275972919816192 2020-07-31 12:05:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@BillHagertyTN, an outstanding man and one of the best Ambassadors ever (Japan), is running an excellent campaign for the Senate. He loves Tennessee and loves our Country. We need him badly in Washington. He has my Complete and Total Endorsement!  https://t.co/VGeHlzYfwy
1289275311272521728 2020-07-31 12:02:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We just got 50% in Rasmussen, and much higher in our internal polls. We are doing a new ad campaign on Sleepy Joe Biden that will be out on Monday. He has been brought even further LEFT than Crazy Bernie Sanders ever thought possible. By the way, Bernie’s people love me on Trade!
1289260338135699456 2020-07-31 11:03:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great job by Jim Jordan, and also some very good statements by Tony Fauci. Big progress being made!
1289201326375804930 2020-07-31 07:08:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .....Our massive testing capability, rather than being praised, is used by the Lamestream Media and their partner, the Do Nothing Radical Left Democrats, as a point of scorn. This testing, and what we have so quickly done, is used as a Fake News weapon. Sad!
1289201322588241920 2020-07-31 07:08:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Somebody please tell Congressman Clyburn, who doesn’t have a clue, that the chart he put up indicating more CASES for the U.S. than Europe, is because we do MUCH MORE testing than any other country in the World. If we had no testing, or bad testing, we would show very few CASES..

1288981002849865728 2020-07-30 16:33:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great to spend time with Mike Singletary while going to Texas. He’s one of the greatest football players ever — A strong man and a really good person. Great being with you Mike!  https://t.co/lWsYn4lhOm

1288966119676616704 2020-07-30 15:34:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> As the Wall goes up, illegal crossings go down. This past week we built over 10 miles of Wall at our Southern Border. We now have 256 miles of NEW Wall and we are on track to have 300 miles completed by the end of August!  https://t.co/AWl0dYfY1w

1288933202812456968 2020-07-30 13:23:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We are going to WIN the 2020 Election, BIG! #MAGA
1288933078287745024 2020-07-30 13:22:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Must know Election results on the night of the Election, not days, months, or even years later!
1288932940337090561 2020-07-30 13:22:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Glad I was able to get the very dishonest LameStream Media to finally start talking about the RISKS to our Democracy from dangerous Universal Mail-In-Voting (not Absentee Voting, which I totally support!).
1288907923914137604 2020-07-30 11:42:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...the phone with his amazing wife Gloria, daughter, Melanie, and son Vincent to express my deepest condolences to the entire family. @FLOTUS Melania and I loved Herman Cain, a great man. Herman, Rest In Peace!  https://t.co/GNUf5jHjX0
1288907916020461569 2020-07-30 11:42:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> My friend Herman Cain, a Powerful Voice of Freedom and all that is good, passed away this morning. Herman had an incredible career and was adored by everyone that ever met him, especially me. He was a very special man, an American Patriot, and great friend. I just got off...
1288843391065882629 2020-07-30 07:26:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Support Patio Pizza and its wonderful owner, Guy Caligiuri, in St. James, Long Island (N.Y.). Great Pizza!!! @Varneyco
1288832830773100544 2020-07-30 06:44:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Drug prices will soon be lowered massively. Big Pharma (Drug Companies) are advertising against me like crazy because lower prices mean less profit. When you watch a Fake Ad, just think lower drug prices!!!
1288826742539464707 2020-07-30 06:20:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Kate Brown, Governor of Oregon, isn’t doing her job. She must clear out, and in some cases arrest, the Anarchists &amp; Agitators in Portland. If she can’t do it, the Federal Government will do it for her. We will not be leaving until there is safety!
1288818160389558273 2020-07-30 05:46:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???
1288815049604292610 2020-07-30 05:33:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Major China Virus flare ups in many of the countries that the Fake News was touting as doing so well. Some of these countries are now a disaster. Lamestream Media doesn’t want to report this. Also, highly inaccurate numbers being reported by many other countries!!! @WSJ
1288809157722877952 2020-07-30 05:10:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mail-In Voting is already proving to be a catastrophic disaster. Even testing areas are way off. The Dems talk of foreign influence in voting, but they know that Mail-In Voting is an easy way for foreign countries to enter the race. Even beyond that, there’s no accurate count!
1288620254130626561 2020-07-29 16:39:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Germany pays Russia billions of dollars a year for Energy, and we are supposed to protect Germany from Russia. What’s that all about? Also, Germany is very delinquent in their 2% fee to NATO. We are therefore moving some troops out of Germany!
1288616496638255105 2020-07-29 16:24:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Check out this Mail-In Voting experiment by a local news station!   https://t.co/23tOdt1hYc
1288602262567153664 2020-07-29 15:28:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> New York Mail-In voting is in a disastrous state of condition. Votes from many weeks ago are missing - a total mess. They have no idea what is going on. Rigged Election. I told you so. Same thing would happen, but on massive scale, with USA. Fake News refuses to report!
1288599151349923840 2020-07-29 15:15:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@FoxNews reported incorrectly what the Federal Government is doing with respect to Portland. We are demanding that the Governor &amp; Mayor do their job or we will do it for them. To complicated to discuss in a Tweet, but bad reporting by Fox (possibly on purpose!). @DHSgov
1288564391735066625 2020-07-29 12:57:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great to be in Texas!

1288520310531272708 2020-07-29 10:02:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...do not stop the Crime and Violence from the Anarchists and Agitators immediately, the Federal Government will go in and do the job that local law enforcement was supposed to do!
1288520300250923014 2020-07-29 10:02:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If the Federal Government and its brilliant Law Enforcement (Homeland) didn’t go into Portland one week ago, there would be no Portland -- It would be burned and beaten to the ground. If the Mayor and Governor...
1288519484823810048 2020-07-29 09:59:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just landed in the Great State of Texas!
1288519158368481280 2020-07-29 09:58:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I was on Air Force One flying to the Great State of Texas, where I just landed. It is AMAZING in watching @FoxNews how different they are from four years ago. Not even watchable. They totally forgot who got them where they are!
1288511210543964162 2020-07-29 09:26:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...With Biden, drug prices will quadruple! After many years, the game is finally up for Big Pharma, and they’re NOT HAPPY about it! Please understand that when you see their negative ads!
1288511206790111233 2020-07-29 09:26:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The drug companies are spending millions of dollars in advertising against me, only because I am lowering drug prices massively, 50% and more! Biden and Obama said they would do this for eight years, but never did...
1288509572223651840 2020-07-29 09:19:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...Your housing prices will go up based on the market, and crime will go down. I have rescinded the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. Enjoy!
1288509568578777088 2020-07-29 09:19:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am happy to inform all of the people living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood...
1288506554585505793 2020-07-29 09:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If Congress doesn’t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders. In Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!
1288503765008445441 2020-07-29 08:56:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Reno-Stead Airport has big bucks coming its way. I’m designating over $4.8 million from @USDOT to reconstruct the airport’s taxiway and ramp. This, along with 4 other airport grants to Nevada, will help in the economic recovery and GROWTH of the State!
1288503343640276994 2020-07-29 08:55:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> BIG bucks are on their way to @ILMairport. Over $21.1 MILLION designated to Wilmington International from @USDOT to expand their terminal and make other major upgrades and safety enhancements. This will help to create JOBS and growth in the region!
1288503162404397061 2020-07-29 08:54:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am designating $18.9 million from @USDOT to MANY airports in Ohio, including @goingplacescle, @CAKairport, and several others, for improvements, updates, and safety. Great for the economy and the people of Ohio!
1288503057999749121 2020-07-29 08:54:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great news for Florida! $3.3 million will be sent to @flyKissimmee from @USDOT for airport improvements and safety enhancements. This is so important for Central Florida and will bring a much-needed boost to the State’s economy!
1288502990798639105 2020-07-29 08:53:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am designating $18.77M from @USDOT for 7 airports across Pennsylvania. @PITairport, Northeast Philadelphia Airport, Erie International Airport, and others around the State. GREAT news for a GREAT State!
1288502576229445632 2020-07-29 08:52:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Texarkana Regional Airport has a major grant coming its way from @USDOT. I’m designating $3.6 million to reconstruct its terminal building, in addition to 5 more airport grants around the State. Glad to help the people of Arkansas!
1288436818573168641 2020-07-29 04:30:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> LAW &amp; ORDER!
1288436755646099459 2020-07-29 04:30:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Sleepy Joe Biden is just a Trojan Horse for the Radical Left Agenda. He will do whatever they want!
1288435342182318081 2020-07-29 04:24:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The Plus, Self-Help for People Who Hate Self-Help”, by the very smart and witty @greggutfeld, is on sale now. It is great, Canceling Cancel Culture. Make his book as successful as his T.V. Show. Buy it now!

1288433749156388864 2020-07-29 04:18:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Vote these people out. They are CRAZY!  #2020
1288109093694005253 2020-07-28 06:48:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....be able to produce what I have. So when you see those nasty ads from Big Pharma remember, the only reason they are going all out is the massive PRICE REDUCTIONS you are getting - not good for them. Plus, I was only President in 51 years that got a Prescription D reduction!
1288109090061705222 2020-07-28 06:48:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big Pharma is taking television ads trying to make the case that I am raising prescription drug prices on seniors. The ad is a lie! What I have done will lead to a 50% REDUCTION in prices, at least, &amp; Big Pharma is not happy about it. No other President would....
1288095296363405314 2020-07-28 05:53:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Nadler calls ANTIFA violence a MYTH.” @foxandfriends  They are Anarchists with miles of “tape” showing their illegal activity. Jerry, blame it on Russia, Russia, Russia!
1287945545600966658 2020-07-27 19:58:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....would destroy our American cities, and worse, if Sleepy Joe Biden, the puppet of the Left, ever won. Markets would crash and cities would burn. Our Country would suffer like never before. We will beat the Virus, soon, and go on to the Golden Age - better than ever before!
1287945543642222599 2020-07-27 19:58:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media is trying to portray the Portland and Seattle “protesters” as wonderful, sweet and innocent people just out for a little stroll. Actually, they are sick and deranged Anarchists &amp; Agitators who our great men &amp; women of Law Enforcement easily control, but who...
1287885395590619138 2020-07-27 15:59:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
1287880895051907072 2020-07-27 15:41:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So disgusting to watch Twitter’s so-called “Trending”, where sooo many trends are about me, and never a good one. They look for anything they can find, make it as bad as possible, and blow it up, trying to make it trend. Really ridiculous, illegal, and, of course, very unfair!
1287877621380837378 2020-07-27 15:28:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Anarchists, Agitators or Protestors who vandalize or damage our Federal Courthouse in Portland, or any Federal Buildings in any of our Cities or States, will be prosecuted under our recently re-enacted Statues &amp; Monuments Act. MINIMUM TEN YEARS IN PRISON. Don’t do it! @DHSgov
1287748921956208640 2020-07-27 06:57:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Homeland Security or Federal Forces are little involved in Seattle, other than we have a large standby team in case of emergency. The media is calling that one wrong also. In Portland, we are protecting Federal property, including the Courthouse, which wouldn’t last a day!
1287554056727040008 2020-07-26 18:03:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Rigged Election, and EVERYONE knows it!
1287553771677954049 2020-07-26 18:01:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Where is JUSTICE?
1287539708072009730 2020-07-26 17:06:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He is, and people are not happy about it. The Washington Post is a political front for Amazon. Nobody treated Ronald Reagan worse!
1287537600409014278 2020-07-26 16:57:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Nice!
1287536846050820102 2020-07-26 16:54:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We do more testing than any country in the World, by far, over 55 million tests. Fake News @CNN says we should do more testing. But even if we did 100 times more, they would then say it is still not enough. They are totally discredited, just want Sleepy Joe to win in November!
1287517470497083393 2020-07-26 15:37:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The “protesters” are actually anarchists who hate our Country. The line of innocent “mothers” were a scam that Lamestream refuses to acknowledge, just like they don’t report the violence of these demonstrations!
1287490820669616128 2020-07-26 13:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The 2020 Election will be totally rigged if Mail-In Voting is allowed to take place, &amp; everyone knows it. So much time is taken talking about foreign influence, but the same people won’t even discuss Mail-In election corruption. Look at Patterson, N.J. 20% of vote was corrupted!
1287473812733341696 2020-07-26 12:44:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Because of my strong focus on the China Virus, including scheduled meetings on Vaccines, our economy and much else, I won’t be able to be in New York to throw out the opening pitch for the @Yankees on August 15th. We will make it later in the season!
1287472054527197190 2020-07-26 12:37:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Lamestream Media, including @FoxNews, which has really checked out, is refusing to show what is REALLY going on in Portland, Seattle, and other places. They want the American public to believe that these are just some wonderful protesters, not radical left ANARCHISTS!
1287470740237946882 2020-07-26 12:31:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is NO WAY a place like Pennsylvania can vote for the Radical Left and their puppet, Joe Biden, when they are against fracking, steel production, and just about everything else that Pennsylvania stands for. Likewise, Texas, and many other states!!!
1287455273473507330 2020-07-26 11:30:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So the Washington Post is running the Reagan Foundation, and RINO Paul Ryan is on the Board of Fox, which has been terrible. We will win anyway, even with the phony @FoxNews suppression polls (which have been seriously wrong for 5 years)!
1287373747180244992 2020-07-26 06:06:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Trump Campaign has more ENTHUSIASM, according to many, than any campaign in the history of our great Country - Even more than 2016. Biden has NONE! The Silent Majority will speak on NOVEMBER THIRD!!! Fake Suppression Polls &amp; Fake News will not save the Radical Left.
1287371355332190208 2020-07-26 05:57:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Crazy Nancy Pelosi said I made a mistake when I banned people from infected China from entering the U.S. in January. Tens of thousands of lives were saved, as she danced in the Streets of Chinatown (SF) in late February. Biden agreed with her, but soon admitted that I was right!
1287368577557975041 2020-07-26 05:46:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Brett LOVES Wisconsin, Mississippi and Minnesota. A good golfer - hits it LONG!
1287366627672166401 2020-07-26 05:38:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This week you had Joe Biden call Arizona a CITY. Nothing matters with him, however, because the Opposition Party (Lamestream Media) covers everything up - especially the corruption. The Obama/Biden Administration is the most corrupt in history. They even spied on my campaign!

He was a fantastic person, and my friend. He kept telling me to run for President. Holds the record for “most live television”, and he did it well. Regis, we love you....
1286994880808591360 2020-07-25 05:01:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> @BrandonStraka Many Democrats are leaving the party over calls to Defund the Police. @foxandfriends @PeteHegseth  Great going Brandon. You really get it!!!
1286990480102825984 2020-07-25 04:43:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrats in the House are trying to undo my big win Travel Ban Bill, which successfully keeps very bad and dangerous people out of our great Country. Passed along party lines. Hopefully, will be DEAD in the Senate! The Dems have gone Stone Cold Left - Venezuela on steroids!
1286985175075827712 2020-07-25 04:22:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow!
1286982004358160384 2020-07-25 04:09:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...to virtual pennies. Epi-pens went from their incredibly high, jacked up prices, to lower than their original give away bargains. Biggest price reductions in history, by far! Nothing like this has ever for our citizens, especially our Seniors. REMEMBER YOUR FAVORITE PRESIDENT!
1286982002604998656 2020-07-25 04:09:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Yesterday I signed four measures that will massively reduce the prices of prescription drugs, in many cases by more than 50%. Nothing like this has ever been done before because Big Pharma, with its vast power, would not let it happen. Expensive Insulin went from big dollars.....
1286878242377478144 2020-07-24 21:17:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congratulations Jim. It was a great and beautiful event. Well deserved!
1286867436193685504 2020-07-24 20:34:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. Win in 2020!!!
1286807899314872320 2020-07-24 16:38:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So Obama and his team of lowlifes spied on my campaign, and got caught - Open and shut case! More papers released today which are devastating to them. Will they ever pay the price? The political Crime of the Century!
1286797798847860736 2020-07-24 15:57:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> 96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!

1286669631072108546 2020-07-24 07:28:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I spoke to highly respected (Chairman) Senator @JimInhofe, who has informed me that he WILL NOT be changing the names of our great Military Bases and Forts, places from which we won two World Wars (and more!). Like me, Jim is not a believer in “Cancel Culture”.
1286662316717744128 2020-07-24 06:59:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great job by @elonmusk in agreeing to build, in TEXAS, what is expected to be the largest auto plant anywhere in the world. He kept his word to me. Texas &amp; @Tesla are big winners. MADE IN THE USA!
1286646085541416960 2020-07-24 05:55:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The great Jim Ryun will be honored this morning at the White House with the presentation of The Presidential Medal of Freedom. Congratulations to Jim and the entire Ryun family. 11:00 A.M. @foxandfriends @FoxNews @OANN

1286455767462219778 2020-07-23 17:18:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 9:00 P.M. on @FoxNews. Enjoy!!!
1286446796181508106 2020-07-23 16:43:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> WELCOME BACK BASEBALL!  https://t.co/dhLSfNkI7L
1286404022442831873 2020-07-23 13:53:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> White House Press Conference at 5:15 P.M. Live!
1286372175117791236 2020-07-23 11:46:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Suburban Housewives of America must read this article. Biden will destroy your neighborhood and your American Dream. I will preserve it, and make it even better!  https://t.co/1NzbR57Oe6
1286337596206055432 2020-07-23 09:29:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Obama, who wouldn’t even endorse Biden until everyone else was out of the primaries (and even then waited a long time!), is now making a commercial of support. Remember, I wouldn’t even be here if it weren’t for them. I wouldn’t be President. They did a terrible job!
1286332695023431683 2020-07-23 09:09:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrats have stated strongly that they won’t approve a Payroll Tax Cut (too bad!). It would be great for workers. The Republicans, therefore, didn’t want to ask for it. Dems, as usual, are hurting the working men and women of our Country!
1286299924141932550 2020-07-23 06:59:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Recently watched failed RINO Tom Ridge, former head of Homeland Security, trying to justify his sudden love of the Radical Left Mayor of Portland, who last night was booed &amp; shouted out of existence by the agitators &amp; anarchists. Love watching pathetic Never Trumpers squirm!
1286280956710723585 2020-07-23 05:44:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We did great things, but it doesn’t matter to the Dems!
1286273485514448900 2020-07-23 05:14:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton is, with the exception of Hillary, by far the worst offender of them all!
1286272857337663489 2020-07-23 05:12:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great, but did MAGA have anything to do with this great ratings success?
1286266178789310465 2020-07-23 04:45:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Liz Cheney is only upset because I have been actively getting our great and beautiful Country out of the ridiculous and costly Endless Wars. I am also making our so-called allies pay tens of billions of dollars in delinquent military costs. They must, at least, treat us fairly!!!
1286070129965649922 2020-07-22 15:46:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am deeply saddened by the loss of my friend Charles Evers. Charles was a trail blazer in politics and a fearless leader, alongside his brother Medgar, for Civil Rights.  https://t.co/rL4bLbCY1D
1286021372070830084 2020-07-22 12:32:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We MUST protect our National Parks for our children and grandchildren. I am calling on the House to pass the GREAT AMERICAN OUTDOORS ACT today. Thanks @SenCoryGardner and @SteveDaines for all your work on this HISTORIC BILL!
1285540318503407622 2020-07-21 04:41:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mail-In Voting, unless changed by the courts, will lead to the most CORRUPT ELECTION in our Nation’s History! #RIGGEDELECTION
1285538283892748288 2020-07-21 04:33:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Strong Stock Market Numbers. You want to see them dive? Vote for the Radical Left with their BIG Tax Hikes!
1285526989667958784 2020-07-21 03:48:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “In my view General Flynn should never have been prosecuted in the first place.” @Judgenap Judge Andrew Napolitano  @foxandfriends
1285524871666118656 2020-07-21 03:39:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> You will never hear this on the Fake News concerning the China Virus, but by comparison to most other countries, who are suffering greatly, we are doing very well - and we have done things that few other countries could have done!
1285522754129858560 2020-07-21 03:31:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Tremendous progress being made on Vaccines and Therapeutics!!!
1285520982648729600 2020-07-21 03:24:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Looking forward to live sports, but any time I witness a player kneeling during the National Anthem, a sign of great disrespect for our Country and our Flag, the game is over for me!
1285520211593105413 2020-07-21 03:21:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you for the good reviews and comments on my interview with Chris Wallace of @FoxNews. We may have set a record for doing such an interview in the heat. It was 100 degrees, making things very interesting!
1285299379746811915 2020-07-20 12:43:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We are United in our effort to defeat the Invisible China Virus, and many people say that it is Patriotic to wear a face mask when you can’t socially distance. There is nobody more Patriotic than me, your favorite President!  https://t.co/iQOd1whktN
1285196013020610562 2020-07-20 05:53:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congratulations Allen, great job!
1284899438591451137 2020-07-19 10:14:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So we catch Obama &amp; Biden, not to even mention the rest of their crew, SPYING on my campaign, AND NOTHING HAPPENS? I hope not! If it were the other way around, 50 years for treason. NEVER FORGET!!!!
1284894845614600194 2020-07-19 09:56:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Radical Left Democrats, who totally control Biden, will destroy our Country as we know it. Unimaginably bad things would happen to America. Look at Portland, where the pols are just fine with 50 days of anarchy. We sent in help. Look at New York, Chicago, Philadelphia. NO!
1284831061181173761 2020-07-19 05:42:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We are trying to help Portland, not hurt it. Their leadership has, for months, lost control of the anarchists and agitators. They are missing in action. We must protect Federal property, AND OUR PEOPLE. These were not merely protesters, these are the real deal!
1284816646104928256 2020-07-19 04:45:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
1284549896389955585 2020-07-18 11:05:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Saddened to hear the news of civil rights hero John Lewis passing. Melania and I send our prayers to he and his family.
1284352067096772609 2020-07-17 21:59:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great job Tammy!
1284282946850086912 2020-07-17 17:24:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Corrupt Joe Biden wants to defund our police. He may use different words, but when you look at his pact with Crazy Bernie, and other things, that’s what he wants to do. It would destroy America!
1284255474691575808 2020-07-17 15:35:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....Tax Returns. She’s a mess! Many books have been written about me, some good, some bad. Both happily and sadly, there will be more to come!
1284255473424891905 2020-07-17 15:35:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....will all end up going to the government anyway. Next up is Mary Trump, a seldom seen niece who knows little about me, says untruthful things about my wonderful parents (who couldn’t stand her!) and me, and violated her NDA. She also broke the Law by givng out my....
1284255472229519360 2020-07-17 15:35:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am the ultimate member of The Book of the Month Club. First I have lowlife dummy John Bolton, a war mongering fool, violating the law (he released massive amounts of Classified Information) and an NDA in order to build badly needed credibility and make a few dollars, which
1284225001659523077 2020-07-17 13:34:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am proud to announce $2 million for the @Sept11Memorial in NYC! This special site ensures that the memory of the nearly 3,000 people killed in the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, as well as those lost in the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, will never be forgotten!
1284224894092312581 2020-07-17 13:34:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In addition to nearly $8 billion that Treasury provided tribal communities, @HUDgov is releasing an additional $25 million in #CARESAct funding today to respond to the CoronaVirus with improved housing, indoor air quality, and food pantry support.
1284224278666321920 2020-07-17 13:31:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump>  https://t.co/n6cfjHjgaZ
1284162207232733185 2020-07-17 09:25:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU to the 5 million members of the @NRA for once again entrusting me with your FULL &amp; COMPLETE ENDORSEMENT! As long as I am President, I will ALWAYS protect our Great Second Amendment, and never let the Radical Left take away your Rights, your Guns, or your Police! @NRAPVF
1283943240434163712 2020-07-16 18:54:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Another one of many Fake T.V. Ads, this one about the Tennessee Valley Authority, which for years has paid its top executive a ridiculous FORTUNE. Not run by the U.S., but I have long been fighting that crazy “salary” &amp; its polices. Strange ad paid for (?) by “U.S. Tech Workers”.
1283600539599675397 2020-07-15 20:13:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU @NAPOpolice and their 241,000 brave law enforcement members for a FULL &amp; COMPLETE ENDORSEMENT! I will ALWAYS back the men and women in blue, and never let you down. LAW AND ORDER will prevail! #LESM
1283566320802553857 2020-07-15 17:57:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...be on the way, and Americans want safe streets and communities!
1283566319405797378 2020-07-15 17:57:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...campaign. Both were heavily involved in our historic 2016 win, and I look forward to having a big and very important second win together. This one should be a lot easier as our poll numbers are rising fast, the economy is getting better, vaccines and therapeutics will soon...
1283566317929472002 2020-07-15 17:57:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am pleased to announce that Bill Stepien has been promoted to the role of Trump Campaign Manager. Brad Parscale, who has been with me for a very long time and has led our tremendous digital and data strategies, will remain in that role, while being a Senior Advisor to the...
1283434584689049601 2020-07-15 09:13:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> سه نفر در ایران برای شرکت کردن در تظاهرات محکوم به مرگ شده اند. اعدام آنها در هر لحظه قابل انتظار است. اعدام این سه نفر پیامی اسفناک به دنیا می فرستد و نباید انجام شود. #اعدام_نکنید
1283434482322808837 2020-07-15 09:13:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Three individuals were sentenced to death in Iran for participating in protests. The execution is expected momentarily. Executing these three people sends a terrible signal to the world and should not be done! #StopExecutionsInIran
1283429106768662528 2020-07-15 08:51:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden and the Radical Left want to Abolish Police, Abolish ICE, Abolish Bail, Abolish Suburbs, Abolish the 2nd Amendment – and Abolish the American Way of Life. No one will be SAFE in Joe Biden’s America!
1283428971611389952 2020-07-15 08:51:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Biden-Sanders unity plan takes a sledgehammer to charter schools, punishing students for their zip codes. No one will be SAFE in Joe Biden’s America!
1283376421767917568 2020-07-15 05:22:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. The @nytimes is under siege. The real reason is that it has become Fake News. They never covered me correctly - they blew it. People are fleeing, a total mess!
1283374013100720128 2020-07-15 05:13:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great News on Vaccines!
1283373044791160832 2020-07-15 05:09:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> 96% Approval Rating of President Trump in the Republican Party. Thank you!
1283371800982949891 2020-07-15 05:04:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> 88 and 2 (really 1) in ENDORSEMENTS this election cycle, and @FoxNews was critical. Has anyone ever done so well? I doubt it! Steve D. @foxandfriends
1283370156341760001 2020-07-15 04:57:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@GoyaFoods is doing GREAT. The Radical Left smear machine backfired, people are buying like crazy!
1283368139204567040 2020-07-15 04:49:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Has anybody seen or reviewed the written “pact” between Bernie Sanders &amp; Sleepy Joe. It is further left than even Bernie had in mind. Open Borders, crime, really bad to cops and military - The guaranteed destruction of America. Joe never told us this. Never been so CLEAR!!!
1283365563553767424 2020-07-15 04:39:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Joe Biden has made a lot of promises - and not gotten a lot done.” @foxandfriends  That is the understatement of the year!!!
1283240204522921984 2020-07-14 20:21:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congratulations to @RonnyJackson4TX on a big win against a tough and really good opponent. Ronny will be a fantastic Congressman - Will represent the wonderful people of the Great State of Texas, and the USA, very well. Proud of you Ronny!!!
1283224082318843904 2020-07-14 19:17:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A GREAT WIN!
1283215676488986628 2020-07-14 18:43:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow, just called! @TTuberville - Tommy Tuberville WON big against Jeff Sessions. Will be a GREAT Senator for the incredible people of Alabama. @DougJones is a terrible Senator who is just a Super Liberal puppet for Schumer &amp; Pelosi. Represents Alabama poorly. On to November 3rd.
1283192212986232837 2020-07-14 17:10:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden claims to be prioritizing ‘safety of kids’ by keeping schools closed this Fall. Yet he remains silent about children being slaughtered by violence on the streets of Democrat run cities. You &amp; your children won’t be SAFE in Biden’s America, and neither will anyone else!
1283029342084358147 2020-07-14 06:23:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Would be so great if the Media would get the word out to the people in a “fair and balanced” way. We will win anyway, but they are a far more difficult adversary than their Radical Left Do Nothing Democrat Partner!
1282892191082385408 2020-07-13 21:18:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> LAW &amp; ORDER!
1282890085483061248 2020-07-13 21:10:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why we have so many “cases” for the media to constantly refer to!
1282888821001072640 2020-07-13 21:05:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Economy is coming back fast!
1282814301452095489 2020-07-13 16:08:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congratulations to my friend President @AndrzejDuda of Poland on his historic re-election! Looking forward to continuing our important work together across many issues, including defense, trade, energy, and telecommunications security!
1282675421541289985 2020-07-13 06:57:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Lamestream Media is not talking about what is happening with the Stock Market and JOBS. Both are doing GREAT! The Radical Left will destroy the USA. Be careful what you wish for!
1282669015794618373 2020-07-13 06:31:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Majority will reign!
1282668779575615494 2020-07-13 06:30:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So hard to watch @FoxNews anymore. They are working so hard against the people (viewers) that got them there. Their contributors are a disaster, and all over the place. The Radical Left has scared Fox into submission, just like they have so many others. Sad, but we will WIN!
1282647375257964544 2020-07-13 05:05:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Never in history have Police been treated so badly as they are in Democrat run cities - and these cities are a mess. Police must take a stronger stand with the Radical Left politicians that are treating them so badly, and so disrespectfully!!!
1282644601665458176 2020-07-13 04:54:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Republican voter registration is way up, Democrat numbers are down.” @foxandfriends
1282291265661472771 2020-07-12 05:30:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> No, Radical Left anarchists, agitators, looters or protesters will not be knocking down or harming the Washington Monument, the Lincoln or Jefferson Memorials, or just about any other Federal Monumrnt or Statue. If they even try, an automatic 10 years in prison. Sorry!
1282288813075771392 2020-07-12 05:20:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you to J.R. Majewski, a great Air Force Veteran and Trump Supporter who did a beautiful job of turning his lawn into a giant Trump Sign. Thanks also to your fantastic Ohio neighbors. We are making record progress on JOBS, etc. Big Silent Majority!!! @foxandfriends
1282286510390288384 2020-07-12 05:11:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...rounds, no problem. When I play, Fake News CNN, and others, park themselves anywhere they can to get a picture, then scream “President Trump is playing golf.” Actually, I play VERY fast, get a lot of work done on the golf course, and also get a “tiny” bit of exercise. Not bad!
1282286508716756993 2020-07-12 05:11:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I know many in business and politics that work out endlessly, in some cases to a point of exhaustion. It is their number one passion in life, but nobody complains. My “exercise” is playing, almost never during the week, a quick round of golf. Obama played more and much longer....
1282281745585504265 2020-07-12 04:52:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We have now built 240 Miles of new Border Wall on our Southern Border. We will have over 450 Miles built by the end of the year. Have established some of the best Border Numbers ever. The Radical Left Democrats want Open Borders for anyone, including many criminals, to come in!
1282276752090431490 2020-07-12 04:32:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I disagreed with doing this very small (tiny) section of wall, in a tricky area, by a private group which raised money by ads. It was only done to make me look bad, and perhsps it now doesn’t even work. Should have been built like rest of Wall, 500 plus miles.
1282155171909435393 2020-07-11 20:29:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Do RINO’S Pat Toomey &amp; Mitt Romney have any problem with the fact that we caught Obama, Biden, &amp; Company illegally spying on my campaign? Do they care if Comey, McCabe, Page &amp; her lover, Peter S, the whole group, ran rampant, wild &amp; unchecked - lying &amp; leaking all the way? NO!
1282149943164248070 2020-07-11 20:09:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump>  https://t.co/Fw7CH0YtYR
1282129696382234625 2020-07-11 18:48:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Does anyone notice that the real Polls, as opposed to the Fake Suppression Polls also used in 2016, are starting to define Sleepy Joe Biden as someone totally ill-equipped to control the Radical Left, Crime, Cancel Culture, or to even come close to me on REBUILDING THE ECONOMY?
1282117531994660869 2020-07-11 18:00:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump>  https://t.co/xl10x8qmTn

1282104681154609152 2020-07-11 17:09:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> What an INCREDIBLE opening by @JesseBWatters. I will put it up later for everyone to see!
1281932578048614402 2020-07-11 05:45:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> New documents just released reveal General Flynn was telling the truth, and the FBI knew it! @OANN
1281930300960976897 2020-07-11 05:36:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big Senate Race in Alabama on Tuesday. Vote for @TTuberville, he is a winner who will never let you down. Jeff Sessions is a disaster who has let us all down. We don’t want him back in Washington!
1281928087324721154 2020-07-11 05:27:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Bring back Steele!!!

1281927265589309441 2020-07-11 05:24:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Roger Stone was targeted by an illegal Witch Hunt that never should have taken place. It is the other side that are criminals, including Biden and Obama, who spied on my campaign - AND GOT CAUGHT!
1281924439748349962 2020-07-11 05:12:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> That shouldn’t be hard. Corrupt Joe has done nothing good for Black people!
1281923845222522880 2020-07-11 05:10:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John, among others, should have gotten a Pulitzer for exposing Russia, Russia, Russia as Fake News. He was right. The “journalists” who got them were all WRONG. Take back the Pulitzers, which have become a JOKE!
1281922216876224513 2020-07-11 05:04:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was just another phony hit job by the @nytimes. They had no source, they made it up. FAKE NEWS!
1281921247950131200 2020-07-11 05:00:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This man should be extradited, tried, and thrown into jail. A sick lier who was paid by Crooked Hillary &amp; the DNC!
1281919692123316224 2020-07-11 04:54:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congratulations to A.G. Barr. Law &amp; Order!

1281616586273468416 2020-07-10 08:49:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Too many Universities and School Systems are about Radical Left Indoctrination, not Education. Therefore, I am telling the Treasury Department to re-examine their Tax-Exempt Status...

1281556745211523072 2020-07-10 04:51:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mail-In Ballot fraud found in many elections. People are just now seeing how bad, dishonest and slow it is. Election results could be delayed for months. No more big election night answers? 1% not even counted in 2016. Ridiculous! Just a formula for RIGGING an Election....
1281554521748119553 2020-07-10 04:43:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Get it done or the Federal Government will come in and get it done for you!
1281554061972692994 2020-07-10 04:41:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Now that we have witnessed it on a large scale basis, and firsthand, Virtual Learning has proven to be TERRIBLE compared to In School, or On Campus, Learning. Not even close! Schools must be open in the Fall. If not open, why would the Federal Government give Funding? It won’t!!!
1281552520612057088 2020-07-10 04:35:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The great @LouDobbs has a very important new book coming out shortly. “The Trump Century, How Our President Changed the Course Of History Forever”, looks like it will be a big bestseller.

1281260329247399936 2020-07-09 09:14:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!
1281250568342769665 2020-07-09 08:35:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....for another President. This is about PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT. We catch the other side SPYING on my campaign, the biggest political crime and scandal in U.S. history, and NOTHING HAPPENS. But despite this, I have done more than any President in history in first 3 1/2 years!
1281250567373967360 2020-07-09 08:35:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...Won all against the Federal Government and the Democrats send everything to politically corrupt New York, which is falling apart with everyone leaving, to give it a second, third and fourth try. Now the Supreme Court gives a delay ruling that they would never have given...
1281250566199541761 2020-07-09 08:35:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....No Republican Senate Judiciary response, NO “JUSTICE”, NO FBI, NO NOTHING. Major horror show REPORTS on Comey &amp; McCabe, guilty as hell, nothing happens. Catch Obama &amp; Biden cold, nothing. A 3 year, $45,000,000 Mueller HOAX, failed - investigated everything....
1281250565163532288 2020-07-09 08:35:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We have a totally corrupt previous Administration, including a President and Vice President who spied on my campaign, AND GOT CAUGHT...and nothing happens to them. This crime was taking place even before my election, everyone knows it, and yet all are frozen stiff with fear....
1281236412667432961 2020-07-09 07:38:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Courts in the past have given “broad deference”. BUT NOT ME!
1281236214646034432 2020-07-09 07:38:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Supreme Court sends case back to Lower Court, arguments to continue. This is all a political prosecution. I won the Mueller Witch Hunt, and others, and now I have to keep fighting in a politically corrupt New York. Not fair to this Presidency or Administration!
1281209521675874304 2020-07-09 05:52:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT!

Biggest political scandal of our time.” @MariaBartiromo You are 100% correct, Maria, it is a disgrace that nothing happens. Obama and Biden spied on my campaign, AND GOT CAUGHT...BUT NOTHING!
1281206685395292160 2020-07-09 05:40:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
1281206354334625793 2020-07-09 05:39:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> For the 1/100th time, the reason we show so many Cases, compared to other countries that haven’t done nearly as well as we have, is that our TESTING is much bigger and better. We have tested 40,000,000 people. If we did 20,000,000 instead, Cases would be half, etc. NOT REPORTED!

1280861869507567616 2020-07-08 06:50:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Economy and Jobs are growing MUCH faster than anyone (except me!) expected. Job growth is biggest in history. China Virus Mortality Rate is among the LOWEST of any country. Shaping up for a good third quarter, and a great next year! NASDAQ at new record high, 401k’s way up!!!!
1280857657365200902 2020-07-08 06:33:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I disagree with @CDCgov on their very tough &amp; expensive guidelines for opening schools. While they want them open, they are asking schools to do very impractical things. I will be meeting with them!!!
1280853299600789505 2020-07-08 06:16:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Germany, Denmark, Norway,  Sweden and many other countries, SCHOOLS ARE OPEN WITH NO PROBLEMS. The Dems think it would be bad for them politically if U.S. schools open before the November Election, but is important for the children &amp; families. May cut off funding if not open!
1280649677894037509 2020-07-07 16:47:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will miss GREAT Country Rocker, Charlie Daniels, who passed away yesterday in Hermitage, Tennessee. My condolences to his wife Hazel, and their family. Charlie is in my thoughts and prayers. I love his music! #RIPCharlieDaniels

1280234504985157637 2020-07-06 13:17:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Lamestream Fake News Media REFUSE to say that China Virus deaths are down 39%, and that we now have the lowest Fatality (Mortality) Rate in the World. They just can’t stand that we are doing so well for our Country!
1280232979781111808 2020-07-06 13:11:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Corrupt Joe Biden and the Democrats don’t want to open schools in the Fall for political reasons, not for health reasons! They think it will help them in November. Wrong, the people get it!

1280210947014119424 2020-07-06 11:44:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrats would not have BANNED travel from heavily infected China, especially so early, therefore, far more people would have died. Corrupt Joe Biden now admits this!!!

1280203174008303616 2020-07-06 11:13:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They name teams out of STRENGTH, not weakness, but now the Washington Redskins &amp; Cleveland Indians, two fabled sports franchises, look like they are going to be changing their names in order to be politically correct.

1279887994107891717 2020-07-05 14:20:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Chicago and New York City crime numbers are way up. 67 people shot in Chicago, 13 killed. Shootings up significantly in NYC where people are demanding that @NYGovCuomo &amp; @NYCMayor act now. Federal Government ready, willing and able to help, if asked!

1279879585627279365 2020-07-05 13:47:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@FoxNews gladly puts up the phony suppression polls as soon as they come out. We are leading in the REAL polls because people are sick &amp; tired of watching the Democrat run cities, in all cases, falling apart. Also, now 96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party.

1279649292966395904 2020-07-04 22:32:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. @CNN got caught cold manipulating the words and meaning of my 4th of July Speech. They were brazen, desperate. Watch what happens!

1279503442612977665 2020-07-04 12:52:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...And if the Federal Government wasn’t getting ready to go in, and we were all set, it would still be a squatter’s (anarchist’s) mess!
1279487628732256257 2020-07-04 11:49:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....In a certain way, our tremendous Testing success gives the Fake News Media all they want, CASES. In the meantime, Deaths and the all important Mortality Rate goes down. You don’t hear about that from the Fake News, and you never will. Anybody need any Ventilators???
1279487627977252864 2020-07-04 11:49:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Cases, Cases, Cases! If we didn’t test so much and so successfully, we would have very few cases. If you test 40,000,000 people, you are going to have many cases that, without the testing (like other countries), would not show up every night on the Fake Evening News.....

1278897430378041344 2020-07-02 20:44:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is a rise in Coronavirus cases because our testing is so massive and so good, far bigger and better than any other country. This is great news, but even better news is that death, and the death rate, is DOWN. Also, younger people, who get better much easier and faster!
1278892544894668801 2020-07-02 20:25:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He cannot pass the test I “aced”. He should give it a try!!!

1278836342609379328 2020-07-02 16:41:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mail-In Ballots will lead to massive electoral fraud and a rigged 2020 Election. Look at all of the cases and examples that are out there right now, with the Patterson, N.J., being the most recent example. Republicans, in particular, cannot let this happen!
1278833085522509824 2020-07-02 16:29:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@CNN should move Fredo back to the morning slot. He was rewarded for bad ratings with a much better time slot - and again got really bad ratings. Getting totally trounced by @FoxNews. Give him another shot in the morning - He would easily beat Morning Joe’s poorly rated show!

Maybe our GREAT Police, who have been neutralized and scorned by a mayor who hates &amp; disrespects them, won’t let this symbol of hate be affixed to New York’s greatest street. Spend this money fighting crime instead!
1278324680311681024 2020-07-01 06:48:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> NYC is cutting Police $’s by ONE BILLION DOLLARS, and yet the @NYCMayor is going to paint a big, expensive, yellow Black Lives Matter sign on Fifth Avenue, denigrating this luxury Avenue. This will further antagonize New York’s Finest, who LOVE New York &amp; vividly remember the....
1278304961143734273 2020-07-01 05:30:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden was asked questions at his so-called Press Conference yesterday where he read the answers from a teleprompter. That means he was given the questions, just like Crooked Hillary. Never have seen this before!
1278299171523637254 2020-07-01 05:07:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “No corroborating evidence to back reports.” Department of Defense.

I was never briefed because any info that they may have had did not rise to that level
1278287166754492417 2020-07-01 04:19:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> WOW. Record Growth in 2nd Quarter! Under Corrupt Joe Biden and his MASSIVE Tax and Regulation increases, Markets, and your 401k’s, will PLUNGE! Expect a Record 2021!
1278285219649421312 2020-07-01 04:12:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> My Executive Order to protect Monuments, Statues etc., IS IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT. In excess of a 10 year prison term. Please do not put yourself in jeopardy. Many people now under arrest!
1278284552679624705 2020-07-01 04:09:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Russia Bounty story is just another made up by Fake News tale that is told only to damage me and the Republican Party. The secret source probably does not even exist, just like the story itself. If the discredited @nytimes has a source, reveal it. Just another HOAX!
1278283487242567681 2020-07-01 04:05:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congratulations to @foxandfriends on completely dominating the just released morning TV Ratings. Morning Joke, staring Psycho Joe Scarborough on MSDNC, a Concast Company, was a disaster. Even worse was the barely registering @CNN mess!
1278280574801784833 2020-07-01 03:53:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Can’t believe how badly @CNN has done in the newly released TV ratings. They are so far below @FoxNews (thank you President Trump!) that you can barely find them. Fredo should be given a big pay cut! MSDNC also did poorly. As I have long said, Fake News does not pay!!!

1278146740240224256 2020-06-30 19:01:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He knew the questions and still couldn’t answer them. Lamestream Media being laughed at all over the world!

1277609254455779328 2020-06-29 07:25:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Sorry to inform the Do Nothing Democrats, but I am getting VERY GOOD internal Polling Numbers. Just like 2016, the @nytimes Polls are Fake! The @FoxNews Polls are a JOKE! Do you think they will apologize to me &amp; their subscribers AGAIN when I WIN? People want LAW, ORDER &amp; SAFETY!
1277606505680863232 2020-06-29 07:15:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Seattle Looters, Agitators, Anarchists and “Protestors”, are now refusing to leave the “CHOP” Zone. They have ZERO respect for Government, or the Mayor of Seattle or Governor of Washington State! Not good!
1277599710648434691 2020-06-29 06:48:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> 95% Approval Rating of President Trump in the Republican Party. I would imagine the 5% are the RINOS’ and stupid people who don’t want to see great Judges &amp; Supreme Court Justice’s, a new &amp; powerful Military, Choice for Vets, 2A Protection, big RegulationCuts, Life, &amp; much more!
1277581155945021440 2020-06-29 05:34:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Can anyone believe that Princeton just dropped the name of Woodrow Wilson from their highly respected policy center. Now the Do Nothing Democrats want to take off the name John Wayne from an airport. Incredible stupidity!
1277431695248183298 2020-06-28 19:40:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Intel just reported to me that they did not find this info credible, and therefore did not report it to me or @VP. Possibly another fabricated Russia Hoax, maybe by the Fake News @nytimesbooks, wanting to make Republicans look bad!!!
1277429217190428673 2020-06-28 19:30:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Absentee Ballots are fine. A person has to go through a process to get and use them. Mail-In Voting, on the other hand, will lead to the most corrupt Election is USA history. Bad things happen with Mail-Ins. Just look at Special Election in Patterson, N.J. 19% of Ballots a FRAUD!
1277426062922842112 2020-06-28 19:18:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Corrupt Joe Biden’s team is running false ads. Almost everything in them is a knowing lie, just the opposite of what they are saying, &amp; very much like their Fake News partners!
1277424633218772994 2020-06-28 19:12:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Dems want to Defund and Abolish the Police. Not good!

1277215720418484224 2020-06-28 05:22:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News @ nytimes must reveal its “anonymous” source. Bet they can’t do it, this “person” probably does not even exist!
1277214247773253632 2020-06-28 05:16:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Have a good time this morning at First Baptist Dallas Church. The wonderful Pastor @robertjeffress will be joined by our GREAT @VP Mike Pence!
1277212069868318720 2020-06-28 05:07:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Since imposing a very powerful 10 year prison sentence on those that Vandalize Monuments, Statues etc., with many people being arrested all over our Country, the Vandalism has completely stopped. Thank you!
1277209892697317382 2020-06-28 04:59:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Corrupt Joe Biden has confirmed that he “would give UNLIMITED Healthcare to Illegal Immigrants”. This would break our system and bring millions of people to the USA. @foxandfriends
1277207355554516992 2020-06-28 04:48:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Funny to see Corrupt Joe Biden reading a statement on Russia, which was obviously written by his handlers. Russia ate his and Obama’s lunch during their time in office, so badly that Obama wanted them out of the then G-8. U.S. was weak on everything, but especially Russia!
1277202162070753280 2020-06-28 04:28:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...Nobody’s been tougher on Russia than the Trump Administration. With Corrupt Joe Biden &amp; Obama, Russia had a field day, taking over important parts of Ukraine - Where’s Hunter? Probably just another phony Times hit job, just like their failed Russia Hoax. Who is their “source”?
1277202159109537793 2020-06-28 04:28:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Nobody briefed or told me, @VP Pence, or Chief of Staff @MarkMeadows about the so-called attacks on our troops in Afghanistan by Russians, as reported through an “anonymous source” by the Fake News @nytimes.

1276967409925193729 2020-06-27 12:55:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Corrupt Joe Biden said yesterday that we have over “120 million” people dead of Coronavirus!
1276868870037540865 2020-06-27 06:23:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....Obamacare is a joke! Deductible is far too high and the overall cost is ridiculous. My Administration has gone out of its way to manage OC much better than previous, but it is still no good. I will ALWAYS PROTECT PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS,ALWAYS!!!
1276868868359815169 2020-06-27 06:23:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Now that the very expensive, unpopular and unfair Individual Mandate provision has been terminated by us, many States &amp; the U.S. are asking the Supreme Court that Obamacare itself be terminated so that it can be replaced with a FAR BETTER AND MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE.....
1276837074298122240 2020-06-27 04:17:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....We will win the Election against Corrupt Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and Schumer. We will save the Supreme Court, your 2nd Amendment, permanent damage from the ridiculous Green New Deal, and you from massive Tax Hikes. Also, our Heritage, History and LAW &amp; ORDER!
1276837073060868096 2020-06-27 04:17:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Do not believe the Fake News Media. Oklahoma speech had the highest Saturday television ratings in @FoxNews history. @seanhannity dominated T.V. with my interview on Thursday night, more than @CNN &amp; MSDNC COMBINED. These are the real polls, the Silent Majority, not FAKE POLLS!
1276633518433538049 2020-06-26 14:48:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I just had the privilege of signing a very strong Executive Order protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues - and combatting recent Criminal Violence. Long prison terms for these lawless acts against our Great Country!
1276629230617604096 2020-06-26 14:31:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big WIN in Texas on Mail-In Ballots!
1276625241905774594 2020-06-26 14:15:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...I am doing what is necessary to keep our communities safe — and these people will be brought to Justice!
1276625240341307398 2020-06-26 14:15:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I was going to go to Bedminster, New Jersey, this weekend, but wanted to stay in Washington, D.C. to make sure LAW &amp; ORDER is enforced. The arsonists, anarchists, looters, and agitators have been largely stopped...
1276564734465249280 2020-06-26 10:15:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> MANY people in custody, with many others being sought for Vandalization of Federal Property in Lafayette Park. 10 year prison sentences! @FBIWFO  https://t.co/mrLyxbWNvq
1276363963832434694 2020-06-25 20:57:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He has no idea, so the answer is yes!!!
1276363261957603328 2020-06-25 20:54:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Coronavirus deaths are way down. Mortality rate is one of the lowest in the World. Our Economy is roaring back and will NOT be shut down. “Embers” or flare ups will be put out, as necessary!
1276343503782625300 2020-06-25 19:36:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I was honored to be in Wisconsin today, on the edge of beautiful Lake Michigan, with the legendary workers of Marinette Marine!  https://t.co/7RPGKcqsGa
1276312029360541698 2020-06-25 17:31:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If I ever said something so mortifyingly stupid, the Fake News Media would come down on me with a vengeance. This is beyond a normal mistake. Why isn’t the media reporting it?  https://t.co/KkuWLkMfp7
1276275590669242368 2020-06-25 15:06:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 9:00 P.M. Eastern on @FoxNews. Enjoy!
1276209787953246208 2020-06-25 10:44:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Landing in Wisconsin. Launching big new ship contract!
1276207454888448001 2020-06-25 10:35:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> LAW &amp; ORDER!
1276206200393064449 2020-06-25 10:30:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Told that @NYCMayor Bill de Blasio wants to paint the fabled &amp; beautiful Fifth Avenue, right in front of Trump Tower/Tiffany, with a big yellow Black Lives Matter sign. “Pigs in a Blanket, Fry ‘Em Like Bacon”, referring to killing Police, is their chant. NYC Police are furious!
1276205906338824192 2020-06-25 10:29:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Black Lives Matter leader states, “If U.S. doesn’t give us what we want, then we will burn down this system and replace it”. This is Treason, Sedition, Insurrection!
1276205726428327936 2020-06-25 10:28:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Obama/Biden Administration is the most CORRUPT in HISTORY!
1276199680938921985 2020-06-25 10:04:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> When are the thugs, looters, and anarchists moving out of the so-called “Autonomous Zone” in Seattle? Get going!
1276184906159271937 2020-06-25 09:06:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The number of ChinaVirus cases goes up, because of GREAT TESTING, while the number of deaths (mortality rate), goes way down. The Fake News doesn’t like telling you that!
1276183263774674944 2020-06-25 08:59:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Failed presidential candidate (thank you President Trump!), Carly Fiorina, said she will be voting for Corrupt Joe Biden. She lost so badly to me, twice in one campaign, that she should be voting for Joe. No complaints!!!
1276173394053156865 2020-06-25 08:20:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News and phony Fake Suppression Polls have never been worse. The Lamestream Media has gone CRAZY!
1276165243849388032 2020-06-25 07:47:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A @FoxNews commentator just ripped me with lies, with nobody defending. They talked about the “friendly” protesters (they set the Church on fire the day before. They were anything but friendly), and how I stood and held the Bible upside down - it wasn’t upside down. @edhenry
1276006981292249089 2020-06-24 21:19:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “How Trump Is Making Black America Great Again, The Untold Story Of Black Advancement in the Era of Trump.” By Horace Cooper  A great new book!
1276004198199558144 2020-06-24 21:08:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> It was my great honor to free up 5000 square miles of ocean off the coast of Maine. Enjoy!
1275998585377652737 2020-06-24 20:45:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....the good and the bad. It is important for us to understand and remember, even in turbulent and difficult times, and learn from them. Knowledge comes from the most unusual of places!
1275998584551374849 2020-06-24 20:45:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Very sad to see States allowing roving gangs of wise guys, anarchists &amp; looters, many of them having no idea what they are doing, indiscriminately ripping down our statues and monuments to the past. Some are great works of art, but all represent our History &amp; Heritage, both....
1275951862269829121 2020-06-24 17:40:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Pres. Obama destroyed the lobster and fishing industry in Maine. Now it’s back, bigger and better than anyone ever thought possible. Enjoy your “lobstering” and fishing! Make lots of money!
1275914298469093376 2020-06-24 15:10:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden failed with China. They took us to the cleaners! I got $Billions out of China, and gave much of it to our targeted farmers!

1275871808261107712 2020-06-24 12:21:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> LAW &amp; ORDER!
1275835791701422081 2020-06-24 09:58:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Is James Comey and his band of Dirty Cops going to apologize to General Michael Flynn (and many others) for what they have done to ruin his life? What about Robert Mueller and his Angry Democrat Cronies - Are they going to say, SO SORRY? And what about Obama &amp; Biden?
1275801076177022976 2020-06-24 07:40:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great!  Appeals Court Upholds Justice Departments Request To Drop Criminal Case Against General Michael Flynn!
1275646453432684546 2020-06-23 21:26:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A GREAT DAY IN ARIZONA!  https://t.co/jsohSb5QF6
1275637061823815680 2020-06-23 20:49:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> It is ashame that Congress doesn’t do something about the lowlifes that burn the American Flag. It should be stopped, and now!
1275632349389168640 2020-06-23 20:30:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Tomorrow @SenatorTimScott and the Senate Republicans have a Great Bill, the #JUSTICEAct, up for a vote. Will be great for both people of color and police - in fact, has major police support. Rebuilding trust and keeping communities safe! Hope to sign it into law ASAP!
1275599861619077121 2020-06-23 18:21:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> BIG VICTORY for patients – Federal court UPHOLDS hospital price transparency. Patients deserve to know the price of care BEFORE they enter the hospital. Because of my action, they will. This may very well be bigger than healthcare itself. Congratulations America!
1275510212384788480 2020-06-23 12:25:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Cases up only because of our big number testing. Mortality rate way down!!!
1275509191583522816 2020-06-23 12:21:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We broke them up last night, fast. Numerous are, and will be, in prison!
1275479652140822529 2020-06-23 10:23:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hogan Gidley will be leaving the White House on July 1 and heading over to my campaign to be the National Press Secretary.  He is a strong, loyal and trusted member of the team that I know will do an outstanding job! We must WIN this election! Follow him at @JHoganGidley.
1275438930276409344 2020-06-23 07:41:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is with us in all ways, a very high 72% Approval Rating. So, if he is in charge along with V.P. etc., and with us doing all of these really good things, why doesn’t the Lamestream Media treat us as they should? Answer: Because they are Fake News!
1275438921552257026 2020-06-23 07:41:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We did a great job on CoronaVirus, including the very early ban on China, Ventilator production, and Testing, which is by far the most, and best, in the World. We saved millions of U.S. lives.! Yet the Fake News refuses to acknowledge this in a positive way. But they do give....
1275409656488382465 2020-06-23 05:45:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There will never be an “Autonomous Zone” in Washington, D.C., as long as I’m your President. If they try they will be met with serious force!
1275381670561095682 2020-06-23 03:54:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Cases are going up in the U.S. because we are testing far more than any other country, and ever expanding. With smaller testing we would show fewer cases!
1275379766959505408 2020-06-23 03:46:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .....This action is taken effective immediately, but may also be used retroactively for destruction or vandalism already caused. There will be no exceptions!
1275379758021390336 2020-06-23 03:46:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I have authorized the Federal Government to arrest anyone who vandalizes or destroys any monument, statue or other such Federal property in the U.S. with up to 10 years in prison, per the Veteran’s Memorial Preservation Act, or such other laws that may be pertinent.....
1275375135483146241 2020-06-23 03:28:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Washed up Creepster John Bolton is a lowlife who should be in jail, money seized, for disseminating, for profit, highly Classified information. Remember what they did to the young submarine sailor, but did nothing to Crooked Hillary. I ended up pardoning him - It wasn’t fair!
1275290765388918785 2020-06-22 21:53:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> See, Bolton broke the law. Classified Information!
1275287274213777413 2020-06-22 21:39:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Interesting guy. “Bolton is really dumb”.  True, and he broke the law!
1275258921704402945 2020-06-22 19:46:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Numerous people arrested in D.C. for the disgraceful vandalism, in Lafayette Park, of the magnificent Statue of Andrew Jackson, in addition to the exterior defacing of St. John’s Church across the street. 10 years in prison under the Veteran’s Memorial Preservation Act. Beware!
1275256115710885889 2020-06-22 19:35:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Looks what’s going on here. Where are the protesters? Was this man arrested?
1275255772709031936 2020-06-22 19:34:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So terrible!
1275252814206447618 2020-06-22 19:22:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The China Trade Deal is fully intact. Hopefully they will continue to live up to the terms of the Agreement!
1275218587188449280 2020-06-22 17:06:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I brought back Cars &amp; Jobs. Will do it again for Michigan, &amp; everywhere else!!!
1275210912077680640 2020-06-22 16:35:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> WOW! The Trump Rally gives @FoxNews the “LARGEST SATURDAY NIGHT AUDIENCE IN ITS HUSTORY”. Isn’t it amazing that virtually nobody in the Lamestream Media is reporting this rather major feat!
1275199503822467075 2020-06-22 15:50:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Rather hard to believe that @FoxNews didn’t know that the Border Wall is well under construction, fully financed, &amp; already over 200 miles long? Will soon be finished! They just reported that “it is something that Dems are unlikely to budge on in this election year”.  @BretBaier
1275195625798348800 2020-06-22 15:35:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Could somebody please explain to reporter Doug Mckelway of @FoxNews that the Border Wall has long been under construction, the battle (war) is won, the Dems have FINALLY given in. In fact, I will be in Arizona tomorrow to celebrate the 212th plus mile of completion. @BretBaier

1275128932510113792 2020-06-22 11:10:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If people can go out and protest, riot, break into stores, and create all sorts of havoc, they can also go out and VOTE — and keep our Election Honest. With millions of mail-in ballots being sent out, who knows where they are going, and to whom?

1275072468709859328 2020-06-22 07:25:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Unlike the radical left, I will ALWAYS stand against socialism and with the people of Venezuela. My Admin has always stood on the side of FREEDOM and LIBERTY and against the oppressive Maduro regime! I would only meet with Maduro to discuss one thing: a peaceful exit from power!
1275062328971497472 2020-06-22 06:45:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Because of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, 2020 will be the most RIGGED Election in our nations history - unless this stupidity is ended. We voted during World War One &amp; World War Two with no problem, but now they are using Covid in order to cheat by using Mail-Ins!
1275044483047055366 2020-06-22 05:34:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I gave John Bolton, who was incapable of being Senate confirmed because he was considered a wacko, and was not liked, a chance.

1274366494185570304 2020-06-20 08:40:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> BIG COURT WIN against Bolton.

1273985172472500224 2020-06-19 07:25:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why are the Democrats allowed to make fake and fraudulent ads. They should be called out. They did nothing when they had the chance. I have done FAR more than any President in first 3 1/2 years!
1273984211062579200 2020-06-19 07:21:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrats are doing totally false advertising. They have done NOTHING for years, including when Sleepy Joe was V.P., and they now have a Fake ad that my China Deal is losing us jobs. Opposite, &amp; China is paying us $BILLIONS. Also, I LOVE Seniors &amp; protect Preexisting C’s.

1273967324681338880 2020-06-19 06:14:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...ruling &amp; request of yesterday. I have wanted to take care of DACA recipients better than the Do Nothing Democrats, but for two years they refused to negotiate - They have abandoned DACA. Based on the decision the Dems can’t make DACA citizens. They gained nothing! @DHSgov
1273967323901317120 2020-06-19 06:14:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Supreme Court asked us to resubmit on DACA, nothing was lost or won. They “punted”, much like in a football game (where hopefully they would stand for our great American Flag). We will be submitting enhanced papers shortly in order to properly fulfil the Supreme Court’s.....

Thank you!
1273688806508675073 2020-06-18 11:47:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> First thing the anarchists did upon taking over Seattle was “BUILD A WALL”. See, I was ahead of our times!
1273688385065009153 2020-06-18 11:45:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Extraordinary rescue yesterday by our brave and “Semper Paratus” U.S. Coast Guard. Our rapid response and the vessel’s survival equipment allowed these four mariners to see their loved ones again. Well done @USCG!
1273667868362768386 2020-06-18 10:24:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...Based on decisions being rendered now, this list is more important than ever before (Second Amendment, Right to Life, Religous Liberty, etc.) – VOTE 2020!
1273667867523899394 2020-06-18 10:24:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will be releasing a new list of Conservative Supreme Court Justice nominees, which may include some, or many of those already on the list, by September 1, 2020. If given the opportunity, I will only choose from this list, as in the past, a Conservative Supreme Court Justice...
1273666793362673665 2020-06-18 10:20:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> As President of the United States, I am asking for a legal solution on DACA, not a political one, consistent with the rule of law. The Supreme Court is not willing to give us one, so now we have to start this process all over again.
1273665643104079872 2020-06-18 10:15:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The DACA decision, while a highly political one, and seemingly not based on the law, gives the President of the United States far more power than EVER anticipated. Nevertheless, I will only act in the best interests of the United States of America!
1273665329416286219 2020-06-18 10:14:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...Religious Liberty, among many other things, are OVER and GONE!
1273665328514555904 2020-06-18 10:14:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The recent Supreme Court decisions, not only on DACA, Sanctuary Cities, Census, and others, tell you only one thing, we need NEW JUSTICES of the Supreme Court. If the Radical Left Democrats assume power, your Second Amendment, Right to Life, Secure Borders, and...
1273634152433188865 2020-06-18 08:10:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Do you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn’t like me?
1273633632742191106 2020-06-18 08:08:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> These horrible &amp; politically charged decisions coming out of the Supreme Court are shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives. We need more Justices or we will lose our 2nd. Amendment &amp; everything else. Vote Trump 2020!
1273620783131250690 2020-06-18 07:17:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....He didn’t want Bolton anywhere near him. Bolton’s dumbest of all statements set us back very badly with North Korea, even now. I asked him, “what the hell were you thinking?” He had no answer and just apologized. That was early on, I should have fired him right then &amp; there!
1273620779645665280 2020-06-18 07:17:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> When Wacko John Bolton went on Deface the Nation and so stupidly said that he looked at the “Libyan Model” for North Korea, all hell broke out. Kim Jong Un, who we were getting along with very well, went “ballistic”, just like his missiles - and rightfully so....
1273603410340843520 2020-06-18 06:08:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Bolton’s book, which is getting terrible reviews, is a compilation of lies and made up stories, all intended to make me look bad. Many of the ridiculous statements he attributes to me were never made, pure fiction. Just trying to get even for firing him like the sick puppy he is!
1273599899448348672 2020-06-18 05:54:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “It’s a terrible situation, and I blame the leaders of those cities.

1273597096105521155 2020-06-18 05:43:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden got failing grades and polls on his clueless handling of the Swine Flu H1N1. It was a total disaster, they had no idea what they were doing. Among the worst ever!
1273468951838838785 2020-06-17 21:13:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> President Bush fired him also. Bolton is incompetent!
1273468029712707584 2020-06-17 21:10:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wacko John Bolton’s “exceedingly tedious”(New York Times) book is made up of lies &amp; fake stories. Said all good about me, in print, until the day I fired him. A disgruntled boring fool who only wanted to go to war. Never had a clue, was ostracized &amp; happily dumped. What a dope!

1273405198698975232 2020-06-17 17:00:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden was a TOTAL FAILURE in Government. He “bungled” everything that he touched!

1272737867576590336 2020-06-15 20:48:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So true!

1272532925460905984 2020-06-15 07:14:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Our testing is so much bigger and more advanced than any other country (we have done a great job on this!) that it shows more cases. Without testing, or weak testing, we would be showing almost no cases. Testing is a double edged sword - Makes us look bad, but good to have!!!
1272529858501976065 2020-06-15 07:02:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Far Left Fake News Media, which had no Covid problem with the Rioters &amp; Looters destroying Democrat run cities, is trying to Covid Shame us on our big Rallies. Won’t work!

1272510078348857345 2020-06-15 05:43:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I’ve done more in less than 4 years than Biden’s done in more than 40 years, including for Black America. Biden has been a part of every failed decision for decades. Bad Trade Deals, Endless Wars, you name it, he has shown a complete lack of leadership. He’s weak &amp; shot!!!
1272361820058202114 2020-06-14 19:54:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many Democrats want to Defund and Abolish Police Departments. HOW CRAZY!

1272269338892959744 2020-06-14 13:47:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Interesting how ANTIFA and other Far Left militant groups can take over a city without barely a wimpier from soft Do Nothing Democrat leadership,  yet these same weak leaders become RADICAL when it comes to shutting down a state or city and its hard working, tax paying citizens!
1272266206691672064 2020-06-14 13:34:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Does anyone notice how little the Radical Left takeover of Seattle is being discussed in the Fake News Media. That is very much on purpose because they know how badly this weakness &amp; ineptitude play politically. The Mayor &amp; Governor should be ashamed of themselves. Easily fixed!

The terrorists burn and pillage our cities, and they think it is just wonderful, even the death. Must end this Seattle takeover now!

1271428229266628611 2020-06-12 06:04:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Republican Party has not yet voted on a Platform. No rush. I prefer a new and updated Platform, short form, if possible.
1271421438076084224 2020-06-12 05:37:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> How do you think China, Russia, Japan or others would do with him in a negotiation? We would have no Country left!!!

1271145584791965696 2020-06-11 11:21:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Seriously failed presidential candidate, Senator Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren, just introduced an Amendment on the renaming of many of our legendary Military Bases from which we trained to WIN two World Wars. Hopefully our great Republican Senators won’t fall for this!
1271142274416562176 2020-06-11 11:08:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left Governor @JayInslee and the Mayor of Seattle are being taunted and played at a level that our great Country has never seen before. Take back your city NOW. If you don’t do it, I will. This is not a game. These ugly Anarchists must be stopped IMMEDIATELY. MOVE FAST!
1271131218348699648 2020-06-11 10:24:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Anarchists just took over Seattle and the Liberal Democrat Governor just said he knows “nothing about that”.

1271096748983955461 2020-06-11 08:07:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Federal Reserve is wrong so often. I see the numbers also, and do MUCH better than they do. We will have a very good Third Quarter, a great Fourth Quarter, and one of our best ever years in 2021. We will also soon have a Vaccine &amp; Therapeutics/Cure. That’s my opinion. WATCH!
1271082251791499267 2020-06-11 07:09:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THOSE THAT DENY THEIR HISTORY ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT!
1271080249623818242 2020-06-11 07:02:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Sleepy Joe Biden refuses to leave his basement “sanctuary” and tell his Radical Left BOSSES that they are heading in the wrong direction.

1271062068238651392 2020-06-11 05:49:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Our great National Guard Troops who took care of the area around the White House could hardly believe how easy it was. “A walk in the park”, one said. The protesters, agitators, anarchists (ANTIFA), and others, were handled VERY easily by the Guard, D.C. Police, &amp; S.S. GREAT JOB!
1270923257844301836 2020-06-10 20:38:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Domestic Terrorists have taken over Seattle, run by Radical Left Democrats, of course. LAW &amp; ORDER!

1269069457412030464 2020-06-05 17:51:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> What a fantastic group!
1269069041626484737 2020-06-05 17:50:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great!
1269043981461184514 2020-06-05 16:10:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@MayorBowser is grossly incompetent, and in no way qualified to be running an important city like Washington, D.C. If the great men and women of the National Guard didn’t step forward, she would have looked no better than her counterpart Mayor in Minneapolis!
1268998143733051394 2020-06-05 13:08:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...We should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a hand on heart. There are other things you can protest, but not our Great American Flag - NO KNEELING!
1268998142860627969 2020-06-05 13:08:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am a big fan of Drew Brees. I think he’s truly one of the greatest quarterbacks, but he should not have taken back his original stance on honoring our magnificent American Flag. OLD GLORY is to be revered, cherished, and flown high...
1268966947938590721 2020-06-05 11:04:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...over the last number of nights. If she doesn’t treat these men and women well, then we’ll bring in a different group of men and women!
1268966945971417088 2020-06-05 11:04:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The incompetent Mayor of Washington, D.C., @MayorBowser, who’s budget is totally out of control and is constantly coming back to us for “handouts”, is now fighting with the National Guard, who saved her from great embarrassment...
1268957851810066432 2020-06-05 10:28:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I just signed the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act to further improve our VERY POPULAR AND SUCCESSFUL program to help small businesses.

1268942964992114693 2020-06-05 09:29:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Really great numbers by any standard - UNBELIEVABLE!” @JoeSquawk Joe go it right also!
1268890724591964160 2020-06-05 06:01:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> It is a stunner by any stretch of the imagination! @CNBC
1268890135459921921 2020-06-05 05:59:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> It’s a stupendous number. It’s joyous, let’s call it like it is. The Market was right. It’s stunning! @jimcramer  @CNBC
1268888880264155136 2020-06-05 05:54:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Oh no, the Dems are worried again. The only one that can kill this comeback is Sleepy Joe Biden!
1268888049792036867 2020-06-05 05:51:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congratulations to wonderful Charles Payne on having been so optimistic, and therefore correct. Market up BIG!!!
1268887468163698698 2020-06-05 05:48:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will be doing a News Conference at 10:00 A.M. on the Jobs Numbers! White House.
1268886111130189824 2020-06-05 05:43:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is an AMAZING JOBS REPORT! Edward Lawrence @FoxNews
1268885664206073856 2020-06-05 05:41:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am so stunned. I’ve never seen numbers like this and I’ve been doing this for 30 years! Steve M. @MariaBartiromo
1268883807375183873 2020-06-05 05:34:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THESE NUMBERS ARE INCREDIBLE! @MariaBartiromo
1268883561651884032 2020-06-05 05:33:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Really Big Jobs Report. Great going President Trump (kidding but true)!
1268880321786851336 2020-06-05 05:20:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> No Contest. Steve blows him away. So important for Montana. I’ll be there to help Steve win big!!!
1268879488223522816 2020-06-05 05:16:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> True. Steve is a GREAT SENATOR. Need him badly in Washington. Complete and Total Endorsement!
1268874882827378688 2020-06-05 04:58:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great going Mike!
1268874377749319683 2020-06-05 04:56:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thanks for your invaluable help in getting a great man PASSED to run VOICE OF AMERICA. Trying for 25 years and you got it done Jim. Idaho is proud of you!
1268873258985799681 2020-06-05 04:52:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great going Brad!
1268870744538320898 2020-06-05 04:42:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We just landed Wisconsin a massive Navy shipbuilding contract. Beautiful designs!
1268869099431608320 2020-06-05 04:35:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> USA!
1268774841810911232 2020-06-04 22:21:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So great to have Michael home. Just arrived. Very exciting. Thank you to Iran. Don’t wait until after U.S. Election to make the Big deal. I’m going to win. You’ll make a better deal now!
1268728269840449536 2020-06-04 19:16:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A must watch!
1268723566046044160 2020-06-04 18:57:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Sleepy Joe Biden’s 1994 Crime Bill was a total disaster. It was mass incarceration for Black people, many of them innocent. I did Criminal Justice Reform, something Obama &amp; Biden didn’t even try to do - &amp; couldn’t do even if they did try. Biden can never escape his Crime Bill!
1268688014630322177 2020-06-04 16:36:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...Unrelated, I gave Alaska ANWR, major highways, and more. Get any candidate ready, good or bad, I don’t care, I’m endorsing. If you have a pulse, I’m with you!
1268688013791506450 2020-06-04 16:36:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Few people know where they’ll be in two years from now, but I do, in the Great State of Alaska (which I love) campaigning against Senator Lisa Murkowski. She voted against HealthCare, Justice Kavanaugh, and much else...
1268686977320263681 2020-06-04 16:32:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Police Groups Break With Biden” @politico His handlers want him to “Defund the Police.” I want more money for Law Enforcement!
1268685511755026432 2020-06-04 16:26:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great to be with our wonderful Men and Women of the @SecretService. What a job they are doing!  https://t.co/QEBvy1JdUp
1268684040334446593 2020-06-04 16:20:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The problem with asking for someone to give you a letter of resignation, which you do as a courtesy to help them save face, is that it is then harder to say you fired them. I did fire James Mattis. He was no good for Obama, who fired him also, and was no good for me!
1268683085136224257 2020-06-04 16:16:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...in my inner-circle, was totally exhausted by the job, and in the end just slinked away into obscurity. They all want to come back for a piece of the limelight!
1268683083852779520 2020-06-04 16:16:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Kelly didn’t know I was going to fire James Mattis, nor did he have any knowledge of my asking for a letter of resignation. Why would I tell him, he was not...
1268678440225583105 2020-06-04 15:58:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The problem is not the very talented, low-flying helicopter pilots wanting to save our city, the problem is the arsonists, looters, criminals, and anarchists, wanting to destroy it (and our Country)!
1268676378574061571 2020-06-04 15:49:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...Michael is Tough, Smart, and Loves our Country. This has been a big battle in Congress for 25 years. Thank you to our Great Republican Senate! @SenateCloakroom
1268676374501502977 2020-06-04 15:49:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congratulations to Michael Pack! Nobody has any idea what a big victory this is for America. Why? Because he is going to be running the VOICE OF AMERICA (@VOANews), and everything associated with it...
1268675068814659584 2020-06-04 15:44:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I thought this letter from respected retired Marine and Super Star lawyer, John Dowd, would be of interest to the American People. Read it!  https://t.co/I5tjysckZh
1268671097010094082 2020-06-04 15:28:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> YOU DON’T BURN CHURCHES IN AMERICA!
1268670884501426182 2020-06-04 15:28:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...to the UNITED STATES! We have now brought more than 40 American hostages and detainees back home since I took office. Thank you to Iran, it shows a deal is possible!
1268670883121500160 2020-06-04 15:28:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I just got off the phone with former American hostage Michael White, who is now in Zurich after being released from Iran. He will be on a U.S. plane shortly, and is COMING HOME...
1268635752214208514 2020-06-04 13:08:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Radical Left Democrats new theme is “Defund the Police”. Remember that when you don’t want Crime, especially against you and your family. This is where Sleepy Joe is being dragged by the socialists. I am the complete opposite, more money for Law Enforcement! #LAWANDORDER
1268564690143232001 2020-06-04 08:26:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....I will never stop working to secure the release of all Americans held hostage overseas! Thank you Switzerland for your great assistance.
1268564689069527042 2020-06-04 08:26:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am to happy announce that Navy Veteran, Michael White, who has been detained by Iran for 683 days, is on a Swiss plane that just left Iranian Airspace. We expect him to be home with his family in America very soon....
1268552570617901058 2020-06-04 07:37:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Please let this serve as my Complete and Total Endorsement of a great fighter and ally in North Carolina, @LyndaBennettNC. She is strong on Crime, Borders, Military, our Great Vets &amp; 2A. She will be a great help to me in DC. EARLY VOTING STARTS TODAY. We need Lynda Bennett! #NC11
1268522581944082433 2020-06-04 05:38:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Disgraceful!

1268497398239842307 2020-06-04 03:58:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> LAW &amp; ORDER!
1268497297702367235 2020-06-04 03:58:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake Newspaper!
1268496433809952769 2020-06-04 03:54:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> True!
1268496283649609730 2020-06-04 03:54:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mueller should have never been appointed, although he did prove that I must be the most honest man in America!
1268495209790353408 2020-06-04 03:50:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So many people hurt!
1268488763124178949 2020-06-04 03:24:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Matt!
1268488030471536641 2020-06-04 03:21:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This Witch Hunt should never have begun!
1268486703402102785 2020-06-04 03:16:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Caught!
1268399224942706688 2020-06-03 21:28:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> YES!
1268398470286761985 2020-06-03 21:25:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. Very impressive Josh!
1268396601405513728 2020-06-03 21:18:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great job Ted. Country is proud of you!!!
1268392491310612481 2020-06-03 21:01:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> FBI &amp; DOJ had NO EVIDENCE to start an investigation against President Trump. @FoxNews  “These are people with subversive actions and outright lies. They doctored documents.”  @jasoninthehouse  Now proven conclusively that this was the political crime of the century!
1268365815251972096 2020-06-03 19:15:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They spied on the Trump Campaign, and got caught!!!
1268358305170296833 2020-06-03 18:45:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I feel more and more confident that our economy is in the early stages of coming back very strong. Not everyone agrees with me, but I have little doubt. Watch for September, October, November. Next year will be one of the best ever, and look at the Stock Market NOW!
1268347259713880064 2020-06-03 18:02:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...His primary strength was not military, but rather personal public relations. I gave him a new life, things to do, and battles to win, but he seldom “brought home the bacon”. I didn’t like his “leadership” style or much else about him, and many others agree. Glad he is gone!
1268347256748507136 2020-06-03 18:02:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Probably the only thing Barack Obama &amp; I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world’s most overrated General. I asked for his letter of resignation, &amp; felt great about it. His nickname was “Chaos”, which I didn’t like, &amp; changed to “Mad Dog”...
1268167419132084230 2020-06-03 06:07:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....the possible exception of another Republican President, the late, great, Abraham Lincoln...and it’s not even close. The Democrats know this, and so does the Fake News, but they refuse to write or say it because they are inherently corrupt! See “pinned” above.
1268167411230007300 2020-06-03 06:07:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In 3 1/2 years, I’ve done much more for our Black population than Joe Biden has done in 43 years. Actually, he set them back big time with his Crime Bill, which he doesn’t even remember. I’ve done more for Black Americans, in fact, than any President in U.S. history, with...
1268166288993632256 2020-06-03 06:02:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If you watch Fake News @CNN or MSDNC, you would think that the killers, terrorists, arsonists, anarchists, thugs, hoodlums, looters, ANTIFA &amp; others, would be the nicest, kindest most wonderful people in the Whole Wide World. No, they are what they are - very bad for our Country!
1268142181489029121 2020-06-03 04:27:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Really sick to watch the Fake and totally Slanted News(?) coming out of MSDNC and CNN. It bears NO relationship to the Truth or Facts. They are merely offshoots of the DNC, much like the @nytimes and the Amazon @washingtonpost. Just like 2016, but worse. Sad, but we will win big!
1268140310762336256 2020-06-03 04:19:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> LAW &amp; ORDER!
1268139884700721153 2020-06-03 04:18:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congratulations to Randy Feenstra on your big win in the Iowa Republican Primary. You will be a great Congressman!
1268136470415540224 2020-06-03 04:04:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The knew it was Fake and went with it anyway. Lamestream Media is CORRUPT!
1268134050130165760 2020-06-03 03:54:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The National Guard is ready!
1268132269245464577 2020-06-03 03:47:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Get tough police!
1268132011203575811 2020-06-03 03:46:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Undercover Huber is a great spoof, funny, but at the same time sad, because the real @JohnWHuber did absolutely NOTHING. He was a garbage disposal unit for important documents &amp; then, tap, tap, tap, just drag it along &amp; run out of time. A.G. Jeff Sessions was played like a drum!
1268127974659952642 2020-06-03 03:30:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Fredo’s ratings are down more than 50%. People are tired of his act. @CNN IS DYING!
1268124756362121217 2020-06-03 03:17:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So true!
1268118444001681408 2020-06-03 02:52:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I agree, unlike other states that are poorly run &amp; managed, Texas is in great shape...and the Southern Border Wall, which is going up FAST, puts it in even better position!
1268037166946553856 2020-06-02 21:29:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So pathetic to watch the Fake News Lamestream Media playing down the gravity and depravity of the Radical Left, looters and thugs, ripping up our Liberal Democrat run (only) cities. It is almost like they are all working together?
1268033455360786436 2020-06-02 21:15:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Burgess Owens, Utah. “We weren’t to sure in 2016, but we voted for the right person to take us through this process.” @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews  Thank you Burgess. Working hard!
1268029249237274624 2020-06-02 20:58:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> New York’s Finest are not being allowed to perform their MAGIC but regardless, and with the momentum that the Radical Left and others have been allowed to build, they will need additional help. NYC is totally out of control. @NYCMayor &amp; @NYGovCuomo MUST PUT DOWN RIOTING NOW!
1268013914178142209 2020-06-02 19:57:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Chaos, lawlessness, and destruction take over New York.” @FoxNews  When will Governor Cuomo call the Federal Government for help?
1268009894885634054 2020-06-02 19:41:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Media Falsely Claimed Violent Riots Were Peaceful And That Tear Gas Was Used Against Rioters  https://t.co/3crnij4pWT Fake News is hurting our Country so badly. Don’t burn down churches. This article is a must read!
1268006529678049281 2020-06-02 19:28:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> You got it wrong! If the protesters were so peaceful, why did they light the Church on fire the night before? People liked my walk to this historic place of worship! Sen. Susan Collins, Sen. James Lankford, Sen. Ben Sasse. Please read @MZHemingway below.

1267907954537312256 2020-06-02 12:56:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Sleepy Joe has been in politics for 40 years, and did nothing. Now he pretends to have the answers. He doesn’t even know the questions. Weakness will never beat anarchists, looters or thugs, and Joe has been politically weak all of his life. LAW &amp; ORDER!

1267903423954980864 2020-06-02 12:38:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Macy’s at 34th.

1267811637811187712 2020-06-02 06:33:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Yesterday was a bad day for the Cuomo Brothers. New York was lost to the looters, thugs, Radical Left, and all others forms of Lowlife &amp; Scum. The Governor refuses to accept my offer of a dominating National Guard. NYC was ripped to pieces. Likewise, Fredo’s ratings are down 50%!

1267667526382747657 2020-06-01 21:01:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mark!
1267666558178004992 2020-06-01 20:57:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Fake News. Couldn’t hear them during speech!
1267654339209953285 2020-06-01 20:08:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great!
1267634481877454849 2020-06-01 18:49:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> YES!

1267515702652678144 2020-06-01 10:57:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Anarchists, we see you!  https://t.co/ov1dMLu4Eg
1267448029738606593 2020-06-01 06:28:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Trump” is leading in all swing states. Heavily biased Democrat Poll, just like 2016. Biggest “enthusiasm” lead ever!
1267445910826627078 2020-06-01 06:20:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more. Joe doesn’t know anything about it, he is clueless, but they will be the real power, not Joe. They will be calling the shots! Big tax increases for all, Plus!
1267437132240441344 2020-06-01 05:45:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> NOVEMBER 3RD.
1267432507005448192 2020-06-01 05:27:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “These were the people that trashed Seattle years ago. Who’s paying for these people. I was appalled that 13 of Joe Biden’s staff were donating money to bail people out in Minneapolis. They should have stayed in jail until this is over (and beyond).” @newtgingrich @foxandfriends
1267430825659899907 2020-06-01 05:20:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “I don’t see any indication that there were any white supremest groups mixing in. This is an ANTIFA Organization. It seems that the first time we saw it in a major way was Occupy Wall Street. It’s the same mindset.” @kilmeade  @foxandfriends  TRUE!
1267246821597941764 2020-05-31 17:09:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> FAKE NEWS!
1267227396341669889 2020-05-31 15:52:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> LAW &amp; ORDER!
1267216497686056960 2020-05-31 15:08:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Our National Guard stopped them cold last night. Should have been called up sooner!
1267187902192193538 2020-05-31 13:15:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Get tough Democrat Mayors and Governors. These people are ANARCHISTS. Call in our National Guard NOW. The World is watching and laughing at you and Sleepy Joe. Is this what America wants? NO!!!
1267185107980496896 2020-05-31 13:04:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Law &amp; Order in Philadelphia, NOW! They are looting stores. Call in our great National Guard like they FINALLY did (thank you President Trump) last night in Minneapolis. Is this what voters want with Sleepy Joe? All Dems!
1267132763116838913 2020-05-31 09:36:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Lamestream Media is doing everything within their power to foment hatred and anarchy. As long as everybody understands what they are doing, that they are FAKE NEWS and truly bad people with a sick agenda, we can easily work through them to GREATNESS!
1267129644228247552 2020-05-31 09:23:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.
1267126801186394118 2020-05-31 09:12:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Other Democrat run Cities and States should look at the total shutdown of Radical Left Anarchists in Minneapolis last night. The National Guard did a great job, and should be used in other States before it is too late!
1267124501361369091 2020-05-31 09:03:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congratulations to our National Guard for the great job they did immediately upon arriving in Minneapolis, Minnesota, last night. The ANTIFA led anarchists, among others, were shut down quickly. Should have been done by Mayor on first night and there would have been no trouble!
1266915358914621440 2020-05-30 19:12:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Let New York’s Finest be New York’s Finest. There is nobody better, but they must be allowed to do their job!
1266914470066036736 2020-05-30 19:08:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The National Guard has been released in Minneapolis to do the job that the Democrat Mayor couldn’t do. Should have been used 2 days ago &amp; there would not have been damage &amp; Police Headquarters would not have been taken over &amp; ruined. Great job by the National Guard. No games!

1266887324505382912 2020-05-30 17:20:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> MN Gov. Walz: We Estimate 80% of the Rioters Are from out of State  https://t.co/WNRFjZA2Lu via @BreitbartNews
1266800827621990400 2020-05-30 11:37:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hopefully a great, successful and safe ROCKET LAUNCH. Lifting off soon!?!?  @FoxNews  @OANN
1266800113260703744 2020-05-30 11:34:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> 80% of the RIOTERS in Minneapolis last night were from OUT OF STATE. They are harming businesses (especially African American small businesses), homes, and the community of good, hardworking Minneapolis residents who want peace, equality, and to provide for their families.
1266799941273350145 2020-05-30 11:33:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Much more “disinformation” coming out of CNN, MSDNC, @nytimes and @washingtonpost, by far, than coming out of any foreign country, even combined. Fake News is the Enemy of the People!
1266796670609588225 2020-05-30 11:20:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Crossing State lines to incite violence is a FEDERAL CRIME! Liberal Governors and Mayors must get MUCH tougher or the Federal Government will step in and do what has to be done, and that includes using the unlimited power of our Military and many arrests. Thank you!
1266777430016102403 2020-05-30 10:04:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Here we go again. Fake News @CNN is blaming RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA. They are sick losers with VERY bad ratings! P.S. Can’t blame China because they need the cash?
1266760009872007171 2020-05-30 08:54:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> It’s ANTIFA and the Radical Left. Don’t lay the blame on others!
1266737385120960515 2020-05-30 07:25:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis will never be mistaken for the late, great General Douglas McArthur or great fighter General George Patton. How come all of these places that defend so poorly are run by Liberal Democrats? Get tough and fight (and arrest the bad ones). STRENGTH!
1266731291917062145 2020-05-30 07:00:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> These are “Organized Groups” that have nothing to do with George Floyd. Sad!
1266724553620930561 2020-05-30 06:34:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The professionally managed so-called “protesters” at the White House had little to do with the memory of George Floyd. They were just there to cause trouble. The @SecretService handled them easily. Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???
1266711224391213056 2020-05-30 05:41:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....good practice.” As you saw last night, they were very cool &amp; very professional. Never let it get out of hand. Thank you! On the bad side, the D.C. Mayor, @MurielBowser, who is always looking for money &amp; help, wouldn’t let the D.C. Police get involved. “Not their job.” Nice!
1266711223657205763 2020-05-30 05:41:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.

1266711221191020544 2020-05-30 05:41:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great job last night at the White House by the U.S. @SecretService. They were not only totally professional, but very cool. I was inside, watched every move, and couldn’t have felt more safe. They let the “protesters” scream &amp; rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone....

1266434155543506945 2020-05-29 11:20:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement. It’s very simple, nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters, and those looking to cause trouble on social media. Honor the memory of George Floyd!
1266434153932894208 2020-05-29 11:20:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Looting leads to shooting, and that’s why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot. I don’t want this to happen, and that’s what the expression put out last night means....
1266387743996870656 2020-05-29 08:15:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> REVOKE 230!
1266380510344949761 2020-05-29 07:46:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The National Guard has arrived on the scene. They are in Minneapolis and fully prepared. George Floyd will not have died in vain. Respect his memory!!!

1266349790507515905 2020-05-29 05:44:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Regulate Twitter if they are going to start regulating free speech.” @JudgeJeanine @foxandfriends  Well, as they have just proven conclusively, that’s what they are doing. Repeal Section 230!!!
1266346957611708417 2020-05-29 05:33:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The President has been targeted by Twitter.” @MariaBartiromo  What about all of the lies and fraudulent statements made by Adam Schiff, and so many others, on the Russian Witch Hunt Plus, Plus, Plus? What about China’s propaganda? WHO’s mistakes? No flags?  @foxandfriends
1266326065833824257 2020-05-29 04:10:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies &amp; propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party. They have targeted Republicans, Conservatives &amp; the President of the United States. Section 230 should be revoked by Congress. Until then, it will be regulated!
1266231100780744704 2020-05-28 21:53:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!
1266231100172615680 2020-05-28 21:53:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I can’t stand back &amp; watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis. A total lack of leadership. Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard &amp; get the job done right.....
1266172570983940101 2020-05-28 18:00:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> MAIL-IN VOTING WILL LEAD TO MASSIVE FRAUD AND ABUSE. IT WILL ALSO LEAD TO THE END OF OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY. WE CAN NEVER LET THIS TRAGEDY BEFALL OUR NATION. BIG MAIL-IN VICTORY IN TEXAS COURT TODAY. CONGRATS!!!
1266169633016631297 2020-05-28 17:48:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is today criticizing Twitter. “We have a different policy than Twitter on this. I believe strongly that Facebook shouldn’t be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.” Did Twitter criticize Obama for his “you can keep your Dr.”?

1266047584038256640 2020-05-28 09:44:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So ridiculous to see Twitter trying to make the case that Mail-In Ballots are not subject to FRAUD. How stupid, there are examples, &amp; cases, all over the place. Our election process will become badly tainted &amp; a laughingstock all over the World. Tell that to your hater @yoyoel
1266041589455077381 2020-05-28 09:20:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The men and women of the National Guard have been doing a great job fighting the CoronaVirus. This week, I will extend their Title 32 orders through mid-August, so they can continue to help States succeed in their response and recovery efforts.
1266017512162037761 2020-05-28 07:44:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you to our GREAT Republican Congressmen &amp; Congresswomen on your incredibly important blockage last night of a FISA Bill that would just perpetuate the abuse that produced the Greatest Political Crime In the History of the U.S., the Russian Witch-Hunt. Fantastic Job!
1266014911127306240 2020-05-28 07:34:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All over the World the CoronaVirus, a very bad “gift” from China, marches on. Not good!
1266000762057953284 2020-05-28 06:37:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We have just reached a very sad milestone with the coronavirus pandemic deaths reaching 100,000. To all of the families &amp; friends of those who have passed, I want to extend my heartfelt sympathy &amp; love for everything that these great people stood for &amp; represent. God be with you!
1265985660898459655 2020-05-28 05:37:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This will be a Big Day for Social Media and FAIRNESS!

If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let it happen! They tried hard in 2016, and lost. Now they are going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!

1265774767493148672 2020-05-27 15:39:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> At my request, the FBI and the Department of Justice are already well into an investigation as to the very sad and tragic death in Minnesota of George Floyd....
1265768877427851265 2020-05-27 15:16:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If the FISA Bill is passed tonight on the House floor, I will quickly VETO it. Our Country has just suffered through the greatest political crime in its history. The massive abuse of FISA was a big part of it!
1265756765389418496 2020-05-27 14:28:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you to @NASA and @SpaceX for their hard work and leadership. Look forward to being back with you on Saturday!
1265706645134274561 2020-05-27 11:09:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> WARRANTLESS SURVEILLANCE OF AMERICANS IS WRONG!
1265649545410744321 2020-05-27 07:22:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Twitter has now shown that everything we have been saying about them (and their other compatriots) is correct. Big action to follow!
1265633761024188417 2020-05-27 06:19:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Radical Left Lamestream Media, together with their partner, the Do Nothing Democrats, are trying to spread a new narrative that President Trump was slow in reacting to Covid 19. Wrong, I was very fast, even doing the Ban on China long before anybody thought necessary!
1265624335898869760 2020-05-27 05:42:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Psycho Joe Scarborough is rattled, not only by his bad ratings but all of the things and facts that are coming out on the internet about opening a Cold Case. He knows what is happening!
1265613475809763328 2020-05-27 04:59:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We pass 15,000,000 Tests Today, by far the most in the World. Open Safely!
1265612405784162304 2020-05-27 04:54:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We are acting as a police force, not the fighting force that we are, in Afghanistan. After 19 years, it is time for them to police their own Country. Bring our soldiers back home but closely watch what is going on and strike with a thunder like never before, if necessary!
1265606608211660801 2020-05-27 04:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> New papers make CLEAR that the Obama Administration SPIED, in an unprecedented manner, on the Trump Campaign and beyond, and even on the United States Senate. Nobody would ever have believed that this level of illegality and corruption would be taking place in our beautiful USA!
1265604027678670848 2020-05-27 04:21:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We have informed both India and China that the United States is ready, willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute. Thank you!
1265601615261827072 2020-05-27 04:11:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....happen again. Just like we can’t let large scale Mail-In Ballots take root in our Country. It would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots. Whoever cheated the most would win. Likewise, Social Media. Clean up your act, NOW!!!!
1265601611310739456 2020-05-27 04:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can’t let a more sophisticated version of that....

1265473520294903808 2020-05-26 19:42:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congratulations to author Nick Adams on the @simonschuster publication of your new book, “Trump and Churchill, Defenders of Western Civilization”. Certainly a great honor to be compared, in any way, to Winston Churchill.  @NickAdamsinUSA
1265470573297238016 2020-05-26 19:31:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Failing @nytimes, winner of @PulitzerPrizes for its totally flawed coverage of the illegal Russia Witch Hunt, does its research as follows: Think of the absolute worst things you can say about Donald J. Trump, pretend there are sources, and just say it. RETURN THE PULITZERS!
1265466874583711758 2020-05-26 19:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great News: The boring but very nasty magazine, The Atlantic, is rapidly failing, going down the tubes, and has just been forced to announce it is laying off at least 20% of its staff in order to limp into the future. This is a tough time to be in the Fake News Business!
1265427539008380928 2020-05-26 16:40:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!
1265427538140188676 2020-05-26 16:40:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@Twitter is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election. They are saying my statement on Mail-In Ballots, which will lead to massive corruption and fraud, is incorrect, based on fact-checking by Fake News CNN and the Amazon Washington Post....
1265422768625123335 2020-05-26 16:21:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I hope all Republican House Members vote NO on FISA until such time as our Country is able to determine how and why the greatest political, criminal, and subversive scandal in USA history took place!
1265366452170829824 2020-05-26 12:37:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....A total double standard. The only thing the Dems have going for them is their very close relationship with the Fake News Lamestream Media!
1265366451306803201 2020-05-26 12:37:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Didn’t Obama, whose Administration has now been caught cold illegally spying on the Trump campaign, recently also get caught playing golf on a course in Virginia, despite his wife Michelle urging people to stay home, before and after his round, in a major public service message?

Many of the current political complainers thought, at the time, that I was moving far to fast, like Crazy Nancy!
1265301249630654467 2020-05-26 08:18:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> For all of the political hacks out there, if I hadn’t done my job well, &amp; early, we would have lost 1 1/2 to 2 Million People, as opposed to the 100,000 plus that looks like will be the number. That’s 15 to 20 times more than we will lose. I shut down entry from China very early!
1265296994056183809 2020-05-26 08:01:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We made most Governors look very good, even great, by getting them the Ventilators, unlimited Testing, and supplies, all of which they should have had in their own stockpiles. So they look great, and I just keep rolling along, doing great things and getting Fake Lamestream News!
1265277965383983104 2020-05-26 06:45:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Stock Market up BIG, DOW crosses 25,000. S&amp;P 500 over 3000. States should open up ASAP. The Transition to Greatness has started, ahead of schedule. There will be ups and downs, but next year will be one of the best ever!

Maybe or maybe not, but I find Joe to be a total Nut Job, and I knew him well, far better than most. So many unanswered &amp; obvious questions, but I won’t bring them up now! Law enforcement eventually will?
1265271275007721472 2020-05-26 06:19:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The opening of a Cold Case against Psycho Joe Scarborough was not a Donald Trump original thought, this has been going on for years, long before I joined the chorus. In 2016 when Joe &amp; his wacky future ex-wife, Mika, would endlessly interview me, I would always be thinking....
1265257673039249408 2020-05-26 05:25:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Sean Parnell is an American Hero. Conor Lamb has proven to be an American fraud, and a puppet for Crazy Nancy Pelosi. He said he would NOT vote for her for Speaker, and did. Will kill 2A. Voted to impeach (on nothing). A TOTAL &amp; COMPLETE Sean Parnell Endorsement!
1265255845358645254 2020-05-26 05:17:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one. That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote. This will be a Rigged Election. No way!
1265255835124539392 2020-05-26 05:17:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed. The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone.....
1265252781226590209 2020-05-26 05:05:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden’s handling of the H1N1 Swine Flu was a complete and total disaster. Even polls on the matter were terrible!

1265013797334507521 2020-05-25 13:16:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great reviews on our handling of Covid 19, sometimes referred to as the China Virus. Ventilators, Testing, Medical Supply Distribution, we made a lot of Governors look very good - And got no credit for so doing. Most importantly, we helped a lot of great people!
1265011145879977985 2020-05-25 13:05:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Nobody in 50 years has been WEAKER on China than Sleepy Joe Biden. He was asleep at the wheel. He gave them EVERYTHING they wanted, including rip-off Trade Deals. I am getting it all back!
1265009852516110336 2020-05-25 13:00:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Sleepy Joe Biden (mostly his reps.) went crazy when I banned, in late January, people coming in from China. He called me “xenophobic” &amp; then went equally “nuts” when we let in 44,000 people - until he was told they were American citizens coming home. He later apologized!

1262393595560067073 2020-05-18 07:44:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So the so-called HHS Whistleblower was against HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE. Then why did he make, and sign, an emergency use authorization? @NorahODonnell said, “He shared his concerns with a reporter.” In other words, he LEAKED. A dumb @60Minutes hit job on a grandstanding Never Trumper!
1262392931962454020 2020-05-18 07:41:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We are with them!

They make a fortune $$$ by having us stay, and except at the beginning, we never really fought to win. We are more of a police force than the mighty military that we are, especially now as rebuilt. No, I am not acting impulsively!
1262392414859337729 2020-05-18 07:39:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Wall Street Journal Editorial states that it doesn’t want me to act in an “impulsive” manner in Afghanistan. Could somebody please explain to them that we have been there for 19 years, and while soldier counts are way down now, hardly impulsive. Besides, the Taliban is.....
1262364231288197123 2020-05-18 05:47:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! The Front Page @washingtonpost Headline reads, “A BOOST IN TESTS, BUT LACK OF TAKERS.” We have done a great job on Ventilators, Testing, and everything else. Were left little by Obama. Over 11 million tests, and going up fast. More than all countries in the world, combined.

1261680811746701312 2020-05-16 08:32:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Really sad, but even “sadder”, watch flunky @Lawrence CRY when I whipped his mind &amp; he was FORCED to apologize to me over Apprentice fees. Even Psycho Cold Case Joe Scarborough (bad ratings) beat him up, on air, unmercifully. Find tapes &amp; play (5 years back?).

1261650261862383616 2020-05-16 06:30:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We’ve done a GREAT job on Covid response, making all Governors look good, some fantastic (and that’s OK), but the Lamestream Media doesn’t want to go with that narrative, and the Do Nothing Dems talking point is to say only bad about “Trump”. I made everybody look good, but me!

1261302802296561668 2020-05-15 07:29:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am proud to announce that @NJTransit will receive $1.4B in CARES Act funding to assist in their continued operations and to keep people moving in the NY/NJ area! The LARGEST single Federal transit grant to New Jersey Transit ever. Together, we will prevail!
1261270085244792832 2020-05-15 05:19:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....Likewise, the @nytimes and @washingtonpost are a disgrace to journalism. They are all Fake News, and they know it better than anyone else. History is unfolding, and it is not a pretty picture for “journalism”.

1260951768395063298 2020-05-14 08:15:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am proud to announce the first $500M of $3.9B in CARES Act transit funding headed to the NY Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Important funding to keep transit systems clean and operating to get people back to work! Spend it wisely! @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor
1260938381254701060 2020-05-14 07:21:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If I were a Senator or Congressman, the first person I would call to testify about the biggest political crime and scandal in the history of the USA, by FAR, is former President Obama. He knew EVERYTHING. Do it @LindseyGrahamSC, just do it. No more Mr. Nice Guy. No more talk!
1260919777301798912 2020-05-14 06:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Good numbers coming out of States that are opening. America is getting its life back! Vaccine work is looking VERY promising, before end of year. Likewise, other solutions!
1260913802423476224 2020-05-14 05:44:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> 22-O in my endorsements of Congressional Candidates this season. California &amp; Wisconsin won big on Tuesday. Thank you to all of those very brilliant Voters. You will not be disappointed!
1260912207027675136 2020-05-14 05:37:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I don’t know the so-called Whistleblower Rick Bright, never met him or even heard of him, but to me he is a disgruntled employee, not liked or respected by people I spoke to and who, with his attitude, should no longer be working for our government!
1260905587912646656 2020-05-14 05:11:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Wisconsin, home to Tom Tiffany’s big Congressional Victory on Tuesday, was just given another win. Its Democrat Governor was forced by the courts to let the State Open. The people want to get on with their lives. The place is bustling!

1260578860992737285 2020-05-13 07:33:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> As I have said for a long time, dealing with China is a very expensive thing to do. We just made a great Trade Deal, the ink was barely dry, and the World was hit by the Plague from China. 100 Trade Deals wouldn’t make up the difference - and all those innocent lives lost!
1260574760930545666 2020-05-13 07:16:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> When the so-called “rich guys” speak negatively about the market, you must always remember that some are betting big against it, and make a lot of money if it goes down.

Compare that to the Obama/Sleepy Joe disaster known as H1N1 Swine Flu. Poor marks, bad polls - didn’t have a clue!

Likewise, after having been left little, we are now doing more testing than all other countries combined, and with superior tests. Face masks &amp; shields,....
1258020179692445697 2020-05-06 06:05:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The White House CoronaVirus Task Force, headed by Vice President Mike Pence, has done a fantastic job of bringing together vast highly complex resources that have set a high standard for others to follow in the future.

1257793742540386304 2020-05-05 15:06:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I was thrilled to be back in the Great State of Arizona with the incredible, patriotic, and hardworking men and women of @Honeywell!  https://t.co/z8XOjmFquB
1257768408256409601 2020-05-05 13:25:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Will be doing a major interview tonight at 6:30 P.M. Eastern with @DavidMuir on @ABCWorldNews Tonight.
1257753237790158848 2020-05-05 12:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> On #NationalTeacherDay, we recognize the countless men and women who dedicate their lives to instilling character, integrity, and knowledge in the hearts and minds of our Nation’s students, thank you!  https://t.co/sai1FMR1fp
1257744763832299520 2020-05-05 11:51:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Getting ready to land in the Great State of Arizona!
1257744456591130624 2020-05-05 11:50:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Congratulations to Greg Gutfeld, a one time Trump Hater who has come all the way home. His Ratings easily beat no talent Stephen Colbert, nice guy Jimmy Fallon, and wacko “last placer” Jimmy Kimmel. Greg built his show from scratch, and did a great job in doing so. @FoxNews
1257741326650470400 2020-05-05 11:37:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well run States should not be bailing out poorly run States, using CoronaVirus as the excuse! The elimination of Sanctuary Cities, Payroll Taxes, and perhaps Capital Gains Taxes, must be put on the table. Also lawsuit indemnification &amp; business deductions for restaurants &amp; ent.
1257736426206031874 2020-05-05 11:18:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Most of the money raised by the RINO losers of the so-called “Lincoln Project”, goes into their own pockets. With what I’ve done on Judges, Taxes, Regulations, Healthcare, the Military, Vets (Choice!) &amp; protecting our great 2A, they should love Trump. Problem is, I BEAT THEM ALL!
1257725719469158401 2020-05-05 10:35:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Remember this? Happy #CincoDeMayo!
1257715551729676289 2020-05-05 09:55:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Do Nothing Democrats and their leader, the Fake News Lamestream Media, are doing everything possible to hurt and disparage our Country. No matter what we do or say, no matter how big a win, they report that it was a loss, or not good enough. The Enemy of the People!
1257714716492722176 2020-05-05 09:52:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> For the constant criticism from the Do Nothing Democrats and their Fake News partners, here is the newest chart on our great testing “miracle" compared to other countries. Dems and LameStream Media should be proud of the USA, instead of always ripping us down!  https://t.co/8AwnPCNchF
1257659682816241665 2020-05-05 06:13:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Governors should let roads and highway construction begin before heavy traffic starts, which will be soon. Some Governors never stopped, which proved to be very smart. They built and fixed roads during long no traffic periods. Also, saved big dollars!
1257651144739950593 2020-05-05 05:39:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Heading to Arizona!
1257650279740301314 2020-05-05 05:36:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Oil prices moving up nicely as demand begins again!
1257649628327153664 2020-05-05 05:33:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Exciting to see our Country starting to open up again!
1257532114666508291 2020-05-04 21:46:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....lost for Evan “McMuffin” McMullin (to me). Steve Schmidt &amp; Reed Galvin lost for John McCain, Romney’s campaign manager (?) lost big to “O”, &amp; Jennifer Horn got thrown out of the New Hampshire Republican Party. They’re all LOSERS, but Abe Lincoln, Republican, is all smiles!
1257532112233803782 2020-05-04 21:46:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....because they don’t know how to win, and their so-called Lincoln Project is a disgrace to Honest Abe. I don’t know what Kellyanne did to her deranged loser of a husband, Moonface, but it must have been really bad. John Weaver lost big for Kasich (to me). Crazed Rick Wilson....
1257532110971318274 2020-05-04 21:46:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....get even for all of their many failures. You see, these loser types don’t care about 252 new Federal Judges, 2 great Supreme Court Justices, a rebuilt military, a protected 2nd Amendment, biggest EVER Tax &amp; Regulation cuts, and much more. I didn’t use any of them....
1257532101966036993 2020-05-04 21:46:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A group of RINO Republicans who failed badly 12 years ago, then again 8 years ago, and then got BADLY beaten by me, a political first timer, 4 years ago, have copied (no imagination) the concept of an ad from Ronald Reagan, “Morning in America”, doing everything possible to....
1257501668821868545 2020-05-04 19:45:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU #USNSComfort!
1257438733240094726 2020-05-04 15:35:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> MSDNC and FAKE NEWS CNN are going wild trying to protect China!
1257438615828865025 2020-05-04 15:35:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great new book, “Fortitude: American Resilience in the Era of Outrage” by former Navy Seal, and current Texas Congressman @DanCrenshawTX, is now available. A fantastic guy — get your copy today!  https://t.co/7EqltABxbe
1257315077243334656 2020-05-04 07:24:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Interesting? By Congress not wanting the special 5 minute testing apparatus, they are saying that they are not “essential”.  In any event, we have great testing capacity, and have performed 6.5 million tests, which is more than every country in the world, combined!
1257304527843110914 2020-05-04 06:42:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mexico is sadly experiencing very big CoronaVirus problems, and now California, get this, doesn’t want people coming over the Southern Border. A Classic! They are sooo lucky that I am their President. Border is very tight and the Wall is rapidly being built!
1257303100815261696 2020-05-04 06:36:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Republicans love the biggest Tax Cuts, Rebuilt Military, Choice for Vets, saving 2nd Amendment and many other things my Administration has done, but what they love beyond all else is 252 (so far!) Federal Judges, not including two great Supreme Court Justices. A Big Record!
1257286796523814914 2020-05-04 05:31:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> And I’m Endorsing you also Lacy, you truly deserve it. You are doing a great job, and Omar is a disaster who wants much higher taxes, hates our Military &amp; our Vets, demands Open Borders, and is fighting to take away our great 2nd Amendment. Good luck Lacy!
1257283775375040512 2020-05-04 05:19:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Getting great reviews, finally, for how well we are handling the pandemic, especially our strong production of desperately needed ventilators, the building of field hospitals &amp; beds, and soon, the great things we are doing on testing. People are really working well together!
1257258214615367680 2020-05-04 03:38:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Concast” should open up a long overdue Florida Cold Case against Psycho Joe Scarborough. I know him and Crazy Mika well, used them beautifully in the last Election, dumped them nicely, and will state on the record that he is “nuts”. Besides, bad ratings! #OPENJOECOLDCASE
1257138589307219969 2020-05-03 19:42:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I’m with the TRUCKERS all the way. Thanks for the meeting at the White House with my representatives from the Administration. It is all going to work out well!

1257041820124680192 2020-05-03 13:18:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....Fake News got it wrong again, as always, and tens of thousands of lives were saved by my EARLY BAN of China into our Country. The people that we’re allowed were heavily scrutinized and tested U.S. citizens, and as such, I welcome them with open arms!
1257041819097092096 2020-05-03 13:18:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the U.S. Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner...
1257009530673803268 2020-05-03 11:10:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you very much to our beautiful “boaters.” I will never let you down!  https://t.co/Ot5Ffnjj9G
1256957565562486784 2020-05-03 07:43:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....And then came a Plague, a great and powerful Plague, and the World was never to be the same again! But America rose from this death and destruction, always remembering its many lost souls, and the lost souls all over the World, and became greater than ever before!
1256955754428448768 2020-05-03 07:36:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So nice to see this great honor. Thank you (but haven’t played golf in a long time)!
1256954349491818501 2020-05-03 07:30:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Going well despite the Fake News!
1256931676099350528 2020-05-03 06:00:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Some things never get old!
1256930926485024768 2020-05-03 05:57:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Progress being made!
1256930571760087041 2020-05-03 05:56:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you!
1256930134512357377 2020-05-03 05:54:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Keep punching Mike!
1256929658890792960 2020-05-03 05:52:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you!
1256928926124904448 2020-05-03 05:49:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow!
1256928204801089539 2020-05-03 05:46:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hopefully our Country will soon mend. We are all missing our wonderful rallies, and many other things!
1256915740432760835 2020-05-03 04:57:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News doesn’t show real polls. Lamestream Media is totally CORRUPT, the Enemy of the People!
1256911953903202307 2020-05-03 04:42:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@PeteHegseth  “Oh bye the way, I appreciate the message from former President Bush, but where was he during Impeachment calling for putting partisanship aside.” @foxandfriends  He was nowhere to be found in speaking up against the greatest Hoax in American history!
1256788149113520129 2020-05-02 20:30:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Beautiful, thank you to our GREAT @BlueAngels and @AFThunderbirds!
1256721351722876933 2020-05-02 16:04:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> No reason to turn it down, except politics. We have plenty of testing. Maybe you need a new Doctor over there. Crazy Nancy will use it as an excuse not to show up to work!
1256720284540981248 2020-05-02 16:00:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrats are just, as always, looking for trouble. They do nothing constructive, even in times of crisis. They don’t want to blame their cash cow, China, for the plague. China is blaming Europe. Dr. Fauci will be testifying before the Senate very soon! #DONOTHINGDEMOCRATS
1256713236331794437 2020-05-02 15:32:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Not much time to sleep. Thank you!
1256711660787695616 2020-05-02 15:26:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So true, although Honest Abe wasn’t bad. Thank you!
1256702883199881216 2020-05-02 14:51:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> She was thrown off The View like a dog, Zero T.V. Personas. Now Wallace is a 3rd rate lapdog for Fake News MSDNC (Concast). Doesn’t have what it takes!
1256698677864861697 2020-05-02 14:34:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Very cool. Please thank him!
1256696015702425601 2020-05-02 14:24:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I, for one, am glad to see he is back, and well!
1256693593961627655 2020-05-02 14:14:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Border Wall is going up FAST. Over 172 miles already built. 450 miles by early next year, or sooner! Dems want OPEN BORDERS. I want STRONG BORDERS!
1256683935444226048 2020-05-02 13:36:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> That’s right Jack. Keep up the good work!

1256628709496369152 2020-05-02 09:56:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Russia Hoax is the biggest political scandal in American history. Treason!!! Lets see how it ends????

1256573581657604096 2020-05-02 06:17:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> 96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you! Also, just out, highest ever Approval Rating overall in the new Gallup Poll, and shows “Trump beating Sleepy Joe Biden.”
1256570859935932416 2020-05-02 06:06:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous CoronaVirus testing capacity in Washington for the Senators returning to Capital Hill on Monday. Likewise the House, which should return but isn’t because of Crazy Nancy P. The 5 minute Abbott Test will be used. Please inform Dr. Brian P. Monahan. @MarkMeadows

1256202305680158720 2020-05-01 05:42:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out the fire. These are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely! See them, talk to them, make a deal.
1256195312965877760 2020-05-01 05:14:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Cryin Chuck Schumer, compared to what other Senators have brought home to their states, has brought very little back to N.Y. A totally overrated loser, the one thing he has given them is SALT. He never even called me to stop it. No wonder Cuomo &amp; most others can’t stand him. AOC!
1256193615724007425 2020-05-01 05:07:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Cryin’ Chuck Schumer was on a late night show using a false talking point over &amp; over again. “We don’t have enough testing ,” he would repeat, when he knows we have done a great job on Testing, just like we have on Ventilators and everything else. He lied, gave NY SALT. Run AOC!

1255826177350144001 2020-04-30 04:47:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> What happened to General Michael Flynn, a war hero, should never be allowed to happen to a citizen of the United States again!
1255825998521741312 2020-04-30 04:47:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Does anybody really believe that Roger Stone, a man whose house was raided early in the morning by 29 gun toting FBI Agents (with Fake News @CNN closely in toe), was treated fairly. How about the jury forewoman with her unannounced hatred &amp; bias. Same scammers as General Flynn!
1255825648448348161 2020-04-30 04:45:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Despite reports to the contrary, Sweden is paying heavily for its decision not to lockdown. As of today, 2462 people have died there, a much higher number than the neighboring countries of Norway (207), Finland (206) or Denmark (443). The United States made the correct decision!
1255718837762306049 2020-04-29 21:41:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Lyin’ Brian Williams of MSDNC!  https://t.co/3gtkdmoZjJ
1255714490554953736 2020-04-29 21:23:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I must admit that Lyin’ Brian Williams is, while dumber than hell, quite a bit smarter than Fake News @CNN “anchorman” Don Lemon, the “dumbest man on television”. Then you have Psycho Joe “What Ever Happened To Your Girlfriend?” Scarborough, another of the low I.Q. individuals!
1255710938075889664 2020-04-29 21:09:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Lyin’ Brian Williams of MSDNC, a Concast Scam Company, wouldn’t know the truth if it was nailed to his wooden forehead. Remember when he lied about his bravery in a helicopter? Totally made up story. He’s a true dummy who was thrown off Network News like a dog. Stay tuned!
1255708741950943233 2020-04-29 21:01:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just told that Fake News @CNN is falsely reporting that I was recently shouting at my campaign manager over made up nonsense. Actually, he is doing a great job, I never shouted at him (been with me for years, including the 2016 win), &amp; have no intention to do so. Just FAKE NEWS!
1255706636972363776 2020-04-29 20:52:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@CNN doesn’t want to speak about their persecution of General Michael Flynn &amp; why they got the story so wrong. They, along with others, should pay a big price for what they have purposely done to this man &amp; his family. They won’t even cover the big breaking news about this scam!
1255696235970940934 2020-04-29 20:11:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump>  https://t.co/xCzgk5yoUK
1255661296047067138 2020-04-29 17:52:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Happy Birthday to three time Olympian and five term Congressman, @JimRyun!

1255510996623527936 2020-04-29 07:55:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> No, I think Amash would make a wonderful candidate, especially since he is way behind in his district and has no chance of maintaining his Congressional seat. He almost always votes for the Do Nothing Dems anyway. I like him even more than Jill Stein!
1255507868280856581 2020-04-29 07:42:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU @MarkLevinShow!   https://t.co/GJSNM0LUQH
1255484391364665351 2020-04-29 06:09:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> At least they admit it. The Failing @nytimes &amp; @washingtonpost never correct their Fake Reporting!
1255352014042738688 2020-04-28 21:23:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only reason the U.S. has reported one million cases of CoronaVirus is that our Testing is sooo much better than any other country in the World. Other countries are way behind us in Testing, and therefore show far fewer cases!
1255325711960768514 2020-04-28 19:39:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU MICHAEL! @bittyandbeaus  https://t.co/KVXVcdO79E

1255133977360265218 2020-04-28 06:57:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> But I love Diamond &amp; Silk, and so do millions of people!
1255130302655148033 2020-04-28 06:42:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Texas to open businesses in phases beginning Friday. Great job being done by @GregAbbott_TX
1255129366234890240 2020-04-28 06:38:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many States moving to SAFELY &amp; QUICKLY reopen!
1255105998471249923 2020-04-28 05:06:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We are doing far more, and better, Testing than any other country in the world, and yet the media does nothing but complain. No matter how good a job is done, the same as with the Ventilators, they will never say we are doing a great job, they will only viciously gripe!
1254967193420402696 2020-04-27 19:54:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Because Shifty is a crooked politician!
1254908072067313670 2020-04-27 15:59:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump>  https://t.co/12Lv2yr07h
1254877727804600321 2020-04-27 13:58:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 5:30 P.M. Thank you!
1254782650679615492 2020-04-27 07:41:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why should the people and taxpayers of America be bailing out poorly run states (like Illinois, as example) and cities, in all cases Democrat run and managed, when most of the other states are not looking for bailout help? I am open to discussing anything, but just asking?
1254769296280031232 2020-04-27 06:48:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> FAKE NEWS, THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
1254767509460234243 2020-04-27 06:41:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There has never been, in the history of our Country, a more vicious or hostile Lamestream Media than there is right now, even in the midst of a National Emergency, the Invisible Enemy!
1254747293414305792 2020-04-27 05:20:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Blame the Democrats for any “lateness” in your Enhanced Unemployment Insurance. I wanted the money to be paid directly, they insisted it be paid by states for distribution. I told them this would happen, especially with many states which have old computers.
1254586604360011776 2020-04-26 18:42:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So true!
1254577575449497602 2020-04-26 18:06:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> American citizens! We were long ahead of Dems, who were all against the BAN.
1254575880510287872 2020-04-26 17:59:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great!
1254566538725797888 2020-04-26 17:22:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They are one of the worst in the “news” business. Total slime balls!
1254565907399139328 2020-04-26 17:19:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They asked me to be at West Point on June 13th., &amp; I will be there!
1254564582020059136 2020-04-26 17:14:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Laura, just another Fake News Report!
1254544354603143168 2020-04-26 15:54:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Does anybody get the meaning of what a so-called Noble (not Nobel) Prize is, especially as it pertains to Reporters and Journalists? Noble is defined as, “having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals.” Does sarcasm ever work?
1254529069733105665 2020-04-26 14:53:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Reports that H.H.S. Secretary @AlexAzar is going to be “fired” by me are Fake News. The Lamestream Media knows this, but they are desperate to create the perception of chaos &amp; havoc in the minds of the public. They never even called to ask. Alex is doing an excellent job!
1254520891863678977 2020-04-26 14:21:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....fraud @donnabrazile (and others who are even worse). Chris Wallace is nastier to Republicans than even Deface the Nation or Sleepy Eyes. The people who are watching @FoxNews, in record numbers (thank you President Trump), are angry. They want an alternative now. So do I!
1254520890991218691 2020-04-26 14:21:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....Even the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats laughed at the Fox suggestion. No respect for the people running @FoxNews. But Fox keeps on plugging to try and become politically correct. They put RINO Paul Ryan on their Board. They hire “debate questions to Crooked Hillary”....
1254520889212837890 2020-04-26 14:21:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@FoxNews just doesn’t get what’s happening! They are being fed Democrat talking points, and they play them without hesitation or research. They forgot that Fake News @CNN &amp; MSDNC wouldn’t let @FoxNews participate, even a little bit, in the poor ratings Democrat Debates.....
1254477491642732552 2020-04-26 11:28:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....schedule and eating habits, written by a third rate reporter who knows nothing about me. I will often be in the Oval Office late into the night &amp; read &amp; see that I am angrily eating a hamburger &amp; Diet Coke in my bedroom. People with me are always stunned. Anything to demean!
1254477490678104064 2020-04-26 11:28:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I work from early in the morning until late at night, haven’t left the White House in many months (except to launch Hospital Ship Comfort) in order to take care of Trade Deals, Military Rebuilding etc., and then I read a phony story in the failing @nytimes about my work....
1254475682723307520 2020-04-26 11:21:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The people that know me and know the history of our Country say that I am  the hardest working President in history. I don’t know about that, but I am a hard worker and have probably gotten more done in the first 3 1/2 years than any President in history. The Fake News hates it!
1254465783821934595 2020-04-26 10:42:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@CardinalDolan  Thank you for a great call yesterday with Catholic Leaders, and a great Service today from @StPatsNYC!
1254441783523762182 2020-04-26 09:06:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Happy Birthday to Melania, our great First Lady!
1254215201911644163 2020-04-25 18:06:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Had a great call with Catholic Leaders and Educators earlier today. I will be online tomorrow at 10:15 A.M. (Eastern) for Sunday Mass celebrated by @CardinalDolan at St. Patrick’s Cathedral (@StPatsNYC) in New York City. Join me:  https://t.co/pTZMmBF9hb  https://t.co/iQy5iH5Lk6
1254174221481246721 2020-04-25 15:23:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I never said the pandemic was a Hoax! Who would say such a thing? I said that the Do Nothing Democrats, together with their Mainstream Media partners, are the Hoax. They have been called out &amp; embarrassed on this, even admitting they were wrong, but continue to spread the lie!
1254172638307586049 2020-04-25 15:17:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Remember, the Cure can’t be worse than the problem itself. Be careful, be safe, use common sense!
1254168730898173953 2020-04-25 15:01:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, &amp; then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately. They get record ratings, &amp; the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time &amp; effort!
1254145835450933249 2020-04-25 13:30:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Was just informed that the Fake News from the Thursday White House Press Conference had me speaking &amp; asking questions of Dr. Deborah Birx. Wrong, I was speaking to our Laboratory expert, not Deborah, about sunlight etc. &amp; the CoronaVirus. The Lamestream Media is corrupt &amp; sick!
1254077550541844480 2020-04-25 08:59:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If the Wall Street Journal “Editorial” writers had called, as they should have, they would have easily found that I was “NOT happy with the Georgia Governor on Tuesday night.” You said the opposite, and got it wrong as you often do!
1254064154954076163 2020-04-25 08:06:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Do Nothing Democrats are spending much of their money on Fake Ads. I never said that the CoronaVirus is a “Hoax”, I said that the Democrats, and the way they lied about it, are a Hoax. Also, it did start with “one person from China”, and then grew, &amp; will be a “Miracle” end!
1254061979607711745 2020-04-25 07:57:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We have now Tested more than 5 Million People. That is more than any other country in the World, and even more than  all major countries combined!
1254060573655998466 2020-04-25 07:51:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> It is a wonderful feeling to know that our States are loaded up with Ventilators, many brand new and high quality just off of our production lines, and that we are now in a position to help other countries that so desperately need them. Every person needing a Ventilator got one!
1254050117767880706 2020-04-25 07:10:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just spoke to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali of Ethiopia. His Country needs Ventilators, and the U.S. is in good position to help him. We will!
1254032243770736642 2020-04-25 05:59:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many testing sites are, and have been, open &amp; available. Just passed 5 Million Tests, far more than any other country in the world. In fact, more than all other major countries combined! Don’t believe the Fake News!
1254028869859971072 2020-04-25 05:45:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you to the people of Colorado for the warm and gracious notes and letters sent to me for all of the Ventilators we got for you. It was my great honor! @SenCoryGardner
1254022414058631170 2020-04-25 05:20:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@TripleH is a total winner!
1254021070379769856 2020-04-25 05:14:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you to William Perry Pendley of the Bureau of Land Management. Great job on @TuckerCarlson describing some of the most beautiful land in the world! @FoxNews
1253788620642750464 2020-04-24 13:51:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 5:30 P.M. Thank you!
1253779068560039939 2020-04-24 13:13:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump>  https://t.co/x8Yguxf4Ks
1253762674137149446 2020-04-24 12:08:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will never let our Post Office fail. It has been mismanaged for years, especially since the advent of the internet and modern-day technology. The people that work there are great, and we’re going to keep them happy, healthy, and well!
1253700113383534598 2020-04-24 07:59:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great conversation with President Lenin Moreno of the Republic of Ecuador. We will be sending them desperately needed Ventilators, of which we have recently manufactured many, and helping them in other ways. They are fighting hard against CoronaVirus!
1253699994516946945 2020-04-24 07:59:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just spoke to President Juan Orlando Hernandez of the Republic of Honduras. We work closely together on the Southern Border. Will be helping him with his request for Ventilators and Testing.
1253697625573990400 2020-04-24 07:49:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great News! Randall Stephenson, the CEO of heavily indebted AT&amp;T, which owns and presides over Fake News @CNN, is leaving, or was forced out. Anyone who lets a garbage “network” do and say the things that CNN does, should leave ASAP. Hopefully replacement will be much better!
1253695275585220608 2020-04-24 07:40:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I (or @VP) never gave Governor Brian Kemp an OK on those few businesses outside of the Guidelines. FAKE NEWS! Spas, beauty salons, tattoo parlors, &amp; barber shops should take a little slower path, but I told the Governor to do what is right for the great people of Georgia (&amp; USA)!
1253690189144379392 2020-04-24 07:20:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just spoke to President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador. Will be helping them with Ventilators, which are desperately needed. They have worked well with us on immigration at the Southern Border!
1253688241947107331 2020-04-24 07:12:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just spoke to my friend, President Joko Widodo of the Republic of Indonesia. Asking for Ventilators, which we will provide. Great cooperation between us!
1253683467801563138 2020-04-24 06:53:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Our Country wants to move safely forward. There is a tremendous pent up demand. We will open big!
1253681801018605568 2020-04-24 06:46:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake and totally corrupt News is after her as a means of getting to me. She’s smart and strong, knows the truth. Already a heroine to many!
1253679654734573570 2020-04-24 06:38:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Getting VERY good reviews of the job the Federal Government is doing on CoronaVirus. Ventilators, building hospitals, beds and yes, Testing, have been handled incredibly well. Testing is getting exponentially better every day. Love seeing our Country safely opening up!
1253541647696179200 2020-04-23 21:29:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Important news!
1253538626992046080 2020-04-23 21:17:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Disgraceful. Should join the Republican Party!

1252964030253318147 2020-04-22 07:14:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Another FALSE ad by the Do Nothing Democrats. Almost all of their ads are False or Misleading, and the Fake News loves it!

1252915116363874305 2020-04-22 04:00:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will be signing my Executive Order prohibiting immigration into our Country today. In the meantime, even without this order, our Southern Border, aided substantially by the 170 miles of new Border Wall &amp; 27,000 Mexican soldiers, is very tight - including for human trafficking!

1252552057170649088 2020-04-21 03:57:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I’ve had great “ratings” my whole life, there’s nothing unusual about that for me. The White House News Conference ratings are “through the roof”(Monday Night Football, Bachelor Finale , @nytimes) but I don’t care about that. I care about going around the Fake News to the PEOPLE!
1252547765332324352 2020-04-21 03:40:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> It is amazing that I became President of the United States with such a totally corrupt and dishonest Lamestream Media going after me all day, and all night. Either I’m really good, far better than the Fake News wants to admit, or they don’t have nearly the power as once thought!
1252542407285055489 2020-04-21 03:19:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watched the first 5 minutes of poorly rated Morning Psycho on MSDNC just to see if he is as “nuts” as people are saying. He’s worse. Such hatred and contempt! I used to do his show all the time before the 2016 election, then cut him off. Wasn’t worth the effort, his mind is shot!

States, not the Federal Government, should be doing the Testing - But we will work with the Governors and get it done. This is easy compared to the fast production of thousands of complex Ventilators!
1252260073839177728 2020-04-20 08:37:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Last month all you heard from the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats was, “Ventilators, Ventilators, Ventilators.” They screamed it loud &amp; clear, &amp; thought they had us cold, even though it was the State’s task. But everyone got their V’s, with many to spare. Now they scream....
1252243673867313152 2020-04-20 07:32:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Received a very nice call from @GovTimWalz of Minnesota. We are working closely on getting him all he needs, and fast. Good things happening!

Just political talking points for them. For me it’s about lives &amp;  the future of our Country!
1251918194639548417 2020-04-19 09:58:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Nervous Nancy is an inherently “dumb” person. She wasted all of her time on the Impeachment Hoax. She will be overthrown, either by inside or out, just like her last time as “Speaker”. Wallace &amp; @FoxNews are on a bad path, watch!
1251912553602654214 2020-04-19 09:36:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just like I was right on Ventilators (our Country is now the “King of Ventilators”, other countries are calling asking for help-we will!), I am right on testing. Governors must be able to step up and get the job done. We will be with you ALL THE WAY!
1251869990497763328 2020-04-19 06:47:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great credit must be given to @FEMA and all of those that are helping our States make it big!

1251587087696101376 2020-04-18 12:03:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I gave up on Drudge (a really nice guy) long ago, as have many others. People are dropping off like flies!
1251576806534250496 2020-04-18 11:22:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The most often used phrase in the Lamestream Media, by far, is “sources say”, or “officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity”, or anything similar which allows Fake News to make up a phony quote from a person who doesn’t even exist. The American people should demand NAMES!

This is their political playbook, and they will use it right up to the election on November 3rd. They will not change because they feel that this is the only way they can win. America will not be fooled!!!
1251561244106141697 2020-04-18 10:20:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....Example! V.P. Mike Pence held a conference call yesterday with all Democrat Senators. He gave them everything that they would have wanted to hear in terms of gaining ground on the CoronaVirus, but nothing that anyone could have said, including “it’s over”, could have made....
1251561224120254464 2020-04-18 10:20:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> No matter what you do for the Do Nothing Democrats, no matter how GREAT a job you are doing, they will only respond to their Fake partners in the Lamestream Media in the negative, even in a time of crisis. I thought it would be different, but it’s not. In fact, it’s even worse...

1251193712580968450 2020-04-17 10:00:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Cuomo ridiculously wanted “40 thousand Ventilators”. We gave him a small fraction of that number, and it was plenty. State should have had them in stockpile!
1251186839983132673 2020-04-17 09:32:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The States have to step up their TESTING!
1251186179548033025 2020-04-17 09:30:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> China has just announced a doubling in the number of their deaths from the Invisible Enemy. It is far higher than that and far higher than the U.S., not even close!
1251185023459483653 2020-04-17 09:25:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Biden/Obama were a disaster in handling the H1N1 Swine Flu. Polling at the time showed disastrous approval numbers. 17,000 people died unnecessarily and through incompetence! Also, don’t forget their 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare website that should have cost close to nothing!
1251181566740619265 2020-04-17 09:11:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....testing that you should be doing. We have given New York far more money, help and equipment than any other state, by far, &amp; these great men &amp; women who did the job never hear you say thanks. Your numbers are not good. Less talk and more action!
1251181563506757632 2020-04-17 09:11:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Governor Cuomo should spend more time “doing” and less time “complaining”. Get out there and get the job done. Stop talking!

1250448126835675139 2020-04-15 08:37:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Our GREAT Senator from South Carolina, @SenatorTimScott just released a fantastic new book, “OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS: How Hard Work, Community, and Business Can Improve Lives and End Poverty.” Get your copy today!  https://t.co/fmSYMijfgm

1250172326920040449 2020-04-14 14:21:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> White House news conference today at 5:45 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!
1250088893766078470 2020-04-14 08:49:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> My Administration is committed to protecting the Homeland from the scourge of narco-terrorists and traffickers seeking to destabilize the United States and our Hemisphere. Our military deployments in the Caribbean &amp; Eastern Pacific will endure until these threats are neutralized!
1250075668282576898 2020-04-14 07:57:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Tell the Democrat Governors that “Mutiny On The Bounty” was one of my all time favorite movies. A good old fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain. Too easy!
1250067500190089217 2020-04-14 07:24:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> GET RID OF BALLOT HARVESTING, IT IS RAMPANT WITH FRAUD. THE USA MUST HAVE VOTER I.D., THE ONLY WAY TO GET AN HONEST COUNT!
1250063051182747651 2020-04-14 07:07:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Cuomo’s been calling daily, even hourly, begging for everything, most of which should have been the state’s responsibility, such as new hospitals, beds, ventilators, etc. I got it all done for him, and everyone else, and now he seems to want Independence! That won’t happen!
1250056263746162688 2020-04-14 06:40:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrats don’t want to approve more money for our great workers under the incredibly successful “Paycheck” plan. Replenish Account Now!

1249808119217172489 2020-04-13 14:14:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> My deepest sympathies go out to Frieda Chera and the family of the late, great, Stanley Chera, one of Manhattan’s most brilliant real estate minds. Stanley was charitable, kind, and a wonderful friend. He will be truly missed!
1249797383132766215 2020-04-13 13:31:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> First the Fake News Media said that it’s not fair for the President of the United States to be giving news conferences, but it is the only way I can reach the American People, as seen in the below poll.  https://t.co/xP2rqjqtaf
1249782050871300096 2020-04-13 12:30:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> White House news conference today at 5:00 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!
1249712413219397632 2020-04-13 07:53:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....It is the decision of the President, and for many good reasons. With that being said, the Administration and I are working closely with the Governors, and this will continue. A decision by me, in conjunction with the Governors and input from others, will be made shortly!
1249712404260421633 2020-04-13 07:53:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> For the purpose of creating conflict and confusion, some in the Fake News Media are saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states, not that of the President of the United States &amp; the Federal Government. Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect....
1249691642975727616 2020-04-13 06:31:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....disaster, the Energy Industry will be strong again, far faster than currently anticipated. Thank you to all of those who worked with me on getting this very big business back on track, in particular Russia and Saudi Arabia.
1249691637040795654 2020-04-13 06:31:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Having been involved in the negotiations, to put it mildly, the number that OPEC+ is looking to cut is 20 Million Barrels a day, not the 10 Million that is generally being reported. If anything near this happens, and the World gets back to business from the Covid 19.....
1249519742093864961 2020-04-12 19:08:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The @nytimes story is a Fake, just like the “paper” itself. I was criticized for moving too fast when I issued the China Ban, long before most others wanted to do so. @SecAzar told me nothing until later, and Peter Navarro memo was same as Ban (see his statements). Fake News!
1249506799532867585 2020-04-12 18:16:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am working hard to expose the corruption and dishonesty in the Lamestream Media. That part is easy, the hard part is WHY?
1249500443782320129 2020-04-12 17:51:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Paris!
1249499469202292741 2020-04-12 17:47:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you!
1249497171403120642 2020-04-12 17:38:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to it also!
1249489574184747008 2020-04-12 17:08:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great going Natalie!
1249462754257371137 2020-04-12 15:21:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Fake News!
1249453028178001920 2020-04-12 14:43:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Governors, get your states testing programs &amp; apparatus perfected. Be ready, big things are happening. No excuses! The Federal Government is there to help. We are testing more than any country in the World. Also, gear up with Face Masks!
1249450614343507969 2020-04-12 14:33:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Opposition Party (Lamestream Media) and their partner, the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, have put their political game plan in full swing. “Whether he is right or wrong, it doesn’t matter. Criticize ’Trump’ for everything, and don’t let the public see Biden. Hide him.”
1249437936539631616 2020-04-12 13:43:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If the Fake News Opposition Party is pushing, with all their might, the fact that President Trump “ignored early warnings about the threat,” then why did Media &amp; Dems viciously criticize me when I instituted a Travel Ban on China? They said “early &amp; not necessary.” Corrupt Media!
1249424452477235200 2020-04-12 12:49:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just watched Mike Wallace wannabe, Chris Wallace, on @FoxNews. I am now convinced that he is even worse than Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Meet the Press(please!), or the people over at Deface the Nation. What the hell is happening to @FoxNews. It’s a whole new ballgame over there!
1249422044564992001 2020-04-12 12:40:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The big Oil Deal with OPEC Plus is done. This will save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States. I would like to thank and congratulate President Putin of Russia and King Salman of Saudi Arabia. I just spoke to them from the Oval Office. Great deal for all!
1249418405951799309 2020-04-12 12:25:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> For the first time in history there is a fully signed Presidential Disaster Declaration for all 50 States. We are winning, and will win, the war on the Invisible Enemy!

1249370410422095872 2020-04-12 09:14:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great businessman &amp; philanthropist Bernie Marcus, Co-Founder of Home Depot, said that Congress was too distracted by the (phony) Impeachment Witch Hunt when they should have been investigating  CoronaVirus when it first appeared in China. Media played a big roll also!@dcexaminer
1249341983702876161 2020-04-12 07:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> HAPPY EASTER!
1249341768157495296 2020-04-12 07:21:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A very good sign is that empty hospital beds are becoming more and more prevalent. We deployed 418 Doctors, Nurses and Respiratory Therapists from the hospital ship Comfort and the Javits Convention Center to hospitals in NYC &amp; State. Have more bed capacity than was needed. Good!
1249307795196952576 2020-04-12 05:06:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> HAPPY EASTER!  https://t.co/UX5Bhm82H2

1249135225994719232 2020-04-11 17:40:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Cryin’Chuck doesn’t have a clue. Couldn’t care less about the American Worker!
1249132374547464193 2020-04-11 17:29:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mail in ballots substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD!
1249123053180723200 2020-04-11 16:51:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Will be interviewed by @JudgeJeanine tonight at 9:00 P.M. Eastern on @FoxNews!
1249118778404765696 2020-04-11 16:34:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So now the Fake News @nytimes is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe, NOT China. This is a first! I wonder what the Failing New York Times got for this one? Are there any NAMED sources? They were recently thrown out of China like dogs, and obviously want back in. Sad!
1249117097365508097 2020-04-11 16:28:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Governor @GavinNewsom of California has been very nice &amp;  highly supportive about the great job we have done, working together, for California. That is the good news, but this is the bad. He is unfairly under attack by the Radical Left Dems, MSDNC etc. He is strong! Will he fold?
1249104562935431168 2020-04-11 15:38:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will be watching. HAVE A GREAT EASTER!
1249103831994118146 2020-04-11 15:35:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board doesn’t have a clue on how to fight and win. Their views on Tariffs &amp; Trade are losers for the U.S., but winners for other countries, including China. If we followed their standards,  we’d have no Country left. They should love Sleepy Joe!
1249093268920467457 2020-04-11 14:53:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watching @FoxNews on weekend afternoons is a total waste of time. We now have some great alternatives, like @OANN.
1249092100236460033 2020-04-11 14:48:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The President and the Federal Government are doing an excellent job. When they say the death toll isn’t going to be as high as reported, they (the opposition) act like they’re sad because it’s lower. I think they are (Press Conferences) wonderful.” West Virginia Resident, C Span
1249089038499426304 2020-04-11 14:36:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great editorial by @SenRonJohnson!  https://t.co/hGmcwI4OSe
1249081971604631554 2020-04-11 14:08:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wishing all a safe and blessed Easter Sunday. I will be tuning into Pastor @robertjeffress at  https://t.co/roBC6bOARn Church in Dallas, Texas tomorrow morning at 10:20 AM Eastern.
1249048063618043906 2020-04-11 11:53:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> WE WILL BUILD IT AGAIN!
1249046469618864131 2020-04-11 11:47:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....Does anyone ever notice how few quotes from an actual person are given nowadays by the Lamestream Media. Very seldom. The unnamed or anonymous sources are almost always FAKE NEWS.
1249045314994081795 2020-04-11 11:43:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> When the Failing @nytimes or Amazon @washingtonpost writes a story saying “unnamed sources said”, or any such phrase where a person’s  name is not used, don’t believe them. Most of these unnamed sources don’t exist. They are made up to defame &amp; disparage. They have no “source”...

1248637403893583872 2020-04-10 08:42:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Nobody wants to say that if Elizabeth Warren gets out of the race before Super Tuesday, Crazy Bernie Sanders wins virtually every state in a blowout...NOT EVEN CLOSE!  I haven’t heard one member of the Fake News Establishment even mention this irrefutable fact. FAKE NEWS!
1248630671754563585 2020-04-10 08:15:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Invisible Enemy will soon be in full retreat!
1248620923248205824 2020-04-10 07:36:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Because the T.V. Ratings for the White House News Conference’s are the highest, the Opposition Party (Lamestream Media), the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats &amp;, of course, the few remaining RINO’S, are doing everything in their power to disparage &amp; end them. The People’s Voice!
1248620586663702530 2020-04-10 07:35:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The White House Press Conference will take place today at 1:00 P.M., recognizing that it is Good Friday!
1248619884688199682 2020-04-10 07:32:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> HAPPY GOOD FRIDAY TO ALL!
1248615335139262470 2020-04-10 07:14:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow, Approval Rating in the Republican Party - 96%. Thank you!
1248590616151367686 2020-04-10 05:36:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Not good Gregg, but it is what it is. Have to save the airlines!
1248578583225872385 2020-04-10 04:48:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congress must go back to DEDUCTIBILITY by businesses if Restaurants, Clubs &amp; Entertaiment is expected to flourish (like never before)!
1248574557616779264 2020-04-10 04:32:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Democrats are blocking a 251 Billion Dollar funding boost for Small Businesses which will help them keep their employees. It should be for only that reason, with no additions. We should have a big Infrastructure Phase Four with Payroll Tax Cuts &amp; more. Big Economic Bounceback!
1248574029289619458 2020-04-10 04:30:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This week, in only 4 days, we had the biggest Stock Market increase since 1974. We have a great chance for the really big bounce when the Invisible Enemy is gone!
1248475288171761671 2020-04-09 21:57:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Tim Scott is Great!
1248474879227097094 2020-04-09 21:56:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Frank. It’s ABC Fake News. They knew they were wrong when they went with this Hoax of a story!

1248333612212195328 2020-04-09 12:35:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Wall Street Journal always “forgets” to mention that the ratings for the White House Press Briefings are “through the roof” (Monday Night Football, Bachelor Finale, according to @nytimes) &amp; is only way for me to escape the Fake News &amp; get my views across. WSJ is Fake News!
1248319601647247361 2020-04-09 11:39:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great News: Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just been moved out of Intensive Care. Get well Boris!!!

1248266439582244866 2020-04-09 08:08:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@OANN  A key CoronaVirus Model is now predicting far fewer deaths than the number shown in earlier models. That’s because the American people are doing a great job. Social Distancing etc. Keep going!
1248031484532928514 2020-04-08 16:34:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Absentee Ballots are a great way to vote for the many senior citizens, military, and others who can’t get to the polls on Election Day. These ballots are very different from 100% Mail-In Voting, which is “RIPE for FRAUD,” and shouldn’t be allowed!
1248026598860881921 2020-04-08 16:15:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This morning, 450,000 protective suits landed in Dallas, Texas.

1247914464319504385 2020-04-08 08:49:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Bernie Sanders is OUT! Thank you to Elizabeth Warren. If not for her, Bernie would have won almost every state on Super Tuesday! This ended just like the Democrats &amp; the DNC wanted, same as the Crooked Hillary fiasco. The Bernie people should come to the Republican Party, TRADE!
1247908643527409665 2020-04-08 08:26:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> FLATTENING OF THE CURVE!
1247900240155295745 2020-04-08 07:52:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Once we OPEN UP OUR GREAT COUNTRY, and it will be sooner rather than later, the horror of the Invisible Enemy, except for those that sadly lost a family member or friend, must be quickly forgotten. Our Economy will BOOM, perhaps like never before!!!

Trump Derangement Syndrome!
1247897589996908545 2020-04-08 07:42:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Radical Left Democrats have gone absolutely crazy that I am doing daily Presidential News Conferences. They actually want me to STOP! They used to complain that I am not doing enough of them, now they complain that I “shouldn’t be allowed to do them.” They tried to shame.....
1247868300647968771 2020-04-08 05:46:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Will be immediately sending 100 Ventilators to Colorado at the request of Senator Gardner!
1247861952736526336 2020-04-08 05:20:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Republicans should fight very hard when it comes to state wide mail-in voting. Democrats are clamoring for it. Tremendous potential for voter fraud, and for whatever reason,  doesn’t work out well for Republicans. @foxandfriends
1247858593740832772 2020-04-08 05:07:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The number of New Yorkers admitted to hospitals has dropped.” @ainsleyearhardt @foxandfriends  Good news!

1247546362473975809 2020-04-07 08:26:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wisconsin, get out and vote NOW for Justice Daniel Kelly. Protect your 2nd Amendment!
1247545358705664002 2020-04-07 08:22:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why didn’t the I.G., who spent 8 years with the Obama Administration (Did she Report on the failed H1N1 Swine Flu debacle where 17,000 people died?), want to talk to the Admirals, Generals, V.P. &amp; others in charge, before doing her report. Another Fake Dossier!
1247540701291638787 2020-04-07 08:04:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look. Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation?
1247382518376140800 2020-04-06 21:35:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Vote today, Tuesday, for highly respected Republican, Justice Daniel Kelly. Tough on Crime, loves your Military, Vets, Farmers, &amp; will save your 2nd Amendment. A BIG VOTE!

1247185910673952776 2020-04-06 08:34:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Joe Biden wanted the date for the Democrat National Convention moved to a later time period. Now he wants a “Virtual” Convention, one where he doesn’t have to show up. Gee, I wonder why? Also, what ever happened to that phone call he told the Fake News he wanted to make to me?
1247149300175589377 2020-04-06 06:08:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Advertising in the Failing New York Times is WAY down. Washington Post is not much better. I can’t say whether this is because they are Fake News sources of information, to a level that few can understand, or the Virus is just plain beating them up. Fake News is bad for America!

1247130183477460992 2020-04-06 04:53:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Gayle. I only wish the public could fully understand how corrupt &amp; dishonest so much of our Lamestream Media is. My Press Conferences are vital. They are reaching millions of people that are not being told the truth, &amp; haven’t been for years (Witch-Hunts, Fake News)!
1247129414485397504 2020-04-06 04:49:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> For humanitarian reasons, the passengers from the two CoronaVirus stricken cruise ships have been given medical treatment and, when appropriate, allowed to disembark, under strict supervision. Very carefully done. People we’re dying &amp; no other countries would allow them to dock!

1245701858863329281 2020-04-02 06:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Massive amounts of medical supplies, even hospitals and medical centers, are being delivered directly to states and hospitals by the Federal Government.

We are now moving the teams to join others so they can continue to build more hospitals/beds. Keep up the GREAT WORK!
1244354540486512640 2020-03-29 13:03:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you very much to Ken Langone for being a great American and for your wonderful comments on @TeamCavuto.
1244338645198352386 2020-03-29 12:00:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am a great friend and admirer of the Queen &amp; the United Kingdom. It was reported that Harry and Meghan, who left the Kingdom, would reside permanently in Canada. Now they have left Canada for the U.S. however, the U.S. will not pay for their security protection. They must pay!

1244309931874017280 2020-03-29 10:06:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Because the “Ratings” of my News Conferences etc. are so high, “Bachelor finale, Monday Night Football type numbers” according to the @nytimes, the Lamestream Media is going CRAZY. “Trump is reaching too many people, we must stop him.” said one lunatic. See you at 5:00 P.M.!
1244306707536326657 2020-03-29 09:53:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Polls are showing tremendous disapproval of Lamestream Media coverage of the Virus crisis. The Fake News just hasn’t figured that out yet!
1244301861781475328 2020-03-29 09:34:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Lamestream Media wants us to fail. That will NEVER happen!
1244296475254968320 2020-03-29 09:12:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hope the FDA can approve Mask Sterilization equipment ASAP. As per Governor @MikeDeWine, there is a company in Ohio, @Battelle, which has equipment that can sterilize masks quickly.

It will all come roaring back again, and fast!
1244281520065576961 2020-03-29 08:13:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Highly recommended by Governor @MikeDeWine of Ohio. @FDA must move quickly!

1243904684257091585 2020-03-28 07:16:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....very often FAKE NEWS. Lamestream Media should be forced to reveal sources, very much as they did in the long ago past. If they did that, the media would be trusted again, and Fake News would largely be a thing of the past!
1243878874922041345 2020-03-28 05:33:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> One of the reasons that Fake News has become so prevalent &amp; far reaching is the fact that corrupt “journalists” base their stories on SOURCES that they make up in order to totally distort a narrative or story. When you see, “five sources say”, don’t believe the story, it is....
1243873875047448576 2020-03-28 05:13:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So much of the Lamestream Media is writing and broadcasting stories with facts that are made up and knowingly wrong. They are doing it by quoting unnamed sources that simply do not exist. These are very dangerous &amp; corrupt people, who will do anything to win. NAME YOUR SOURCES!
1243759793103306754 2020-03-27 21:40:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More Fake News!
1243755076214231040 2020-03-27 21:21:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Such Fake reporting by the @nytimes, @washingtonpost, @CNN &amp; others. They use a small portion of a sentence out of a full paragraph in order to demean. They really are corrupt and disgusting. No wonder the media is, according to polls, record setting low &amp; untrusted.  #MAGA

1243726993537073152 2020-03-27 19:29:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I love Michigan, one of the reasons we are doing such a GREAT job for them during this horrible Pandemic. Yet your Governor, Gretchen “Half” Whitmer is way in over her head, she doesn’t have a clue. Likes blaming everyone for her own ineptitude! #MAGA
1243705647192997893 2020-03-27 18:05:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> She is a third rate reporter who has nothing going. A Fake News “journalist”.
1243647273462005760 2020-03-27 14:13:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We are marshalling the full power of government and society to achieve victory over the virus. Together, we will endure, we will prevail, and we will WIN! #CARESAct  https://t.co/zb2PJTldGQ
1243637430483390470 2020-03-27 13:34:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I just signed the CARES Act, the single biggest economic relief package in American History – twice as large as any relief bill ever enacted. At $2.2 Trillion Dollars, this bill will deliver urgently-needed relief for our nation’s families, workers, and businesses. #CARESAct🇺🇸
1243637134457810945 2020-03-27 13:32:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> News conference live from the @WhiteHouse today. 5:30 P.M. Eastern!
1243628257871831043 2020-03-27 12:57:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you to Rachel @Maddow for putting our Military on full display, and showing how GREAT a job the Federal Government is doing! Also, a special thanks to General Semonite, a Patriot of the highest order and a truly talented engineer and builder!  https://t.co/JRQlNpLbxv
1243572588200280064 2020-03-27 09:16:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Never knew John Kerry had such a good sense of humor! Very impressed!
1243566007605755904 2020-03-27 08:50:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thousand of Federal Government (delivered) Ventilators found in New York storage. N.Y. must distribute NOW!
1243564774182567936 2020-03-27 08:45:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Will someone please explain to the Fake News New York Times (ALL THE NEWS THAT’S NOT FIT TO PRINT) that the Democrats make it almost impossible for us to fill positions within government. They “maximum” delay even the best candidates, including Judges, leaving little time!
1243561301768581120 2020-03-27 08:31:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We have just purchased many Ventilators from some wonderful companies. Names and numbers will be announced later today!
1243560795415470080 2020-03-27 08:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Invoke “P” means Defense Production Act!
1243559373395410957 2020-03-27 08:23:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!!  FORD, GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!!  @GeneralMotors  @Ford
1243557418556162050 2020-03-27 08:16:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> As usual with “this” General Motors, things just never seem to work out. They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, “very quickly”. Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar. Always a mess with Mary B. Invoke “P”.
1243545579063595008 2020-03-27 07:29:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Byron. Many polls are much better than this. If it is the Fake News @washingtonpost, add 10 points!
1243541556424048643 2020-03-27 07:13:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> By empowering the Radical Left Democrats, do nothing Kentucky politician @RepThomasMassie is making their War on the 2nd Amendment more and more difficult to win (But don’t worry, we will win anyway!). He is a disaster for America, and for the Great State of Kentucky!

It is “HELL” dealing with the Dems, had to give up some stupid things in order to get the “big picture” done. 90% GREAT! WIN BACK HOUSE, but throw Massie out of Republican Party!
1243534441772974081 2020-03-27 06:44:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Looks like a third rate Grandstander named @RepThomasMassie, a Congressman from, unfortunately, a truly GREAT State, Kentucky, wants to vote against the new Save Our Workers Bill in Congress. He just wants the publicity. He can’t stop it, only delay, which is both dangerous......
1243407157321560071 2020-03-26 22:19:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China. Discussed in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet. China has been through much &amp; has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!
1243324360523493378 2020-03-26 16:50:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The world is at war with a hidden enemy. WE WILL WIN!  https://t.co/QLceNWcL6Z

1242929613262725122 2020-03-25 14:41:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I hear that Fake News CNN just reported that I am isolated in the White House, wondering out loud, “when will life return to normal?” Does anybody really believe that? There was no leak, they made it up – they are CORRUPT &amp; FAKE NEWS....
1242905328209080331 2020-03-25 13:04:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The LameStream Media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success. The real people want to get back to work ASAP.  We will be stronger than ever before!
1242840063303659527 2020-03-25 08:45:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Today is National #MedalofHonorDay.

1242827275080531969 2020-03-25 07:54:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congratulations to Prime Minister Abe of Japan, and the IOC, on their very wise decision to present the Olympics in 2021. It will be a great success, and I look forward to being there!
1242826052310794240 2020-03-25 07:49:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The four hospitals that we (FEMA) are building in NYC at the Javits Convention Center are moving along very well, ahead of schedule. Many additional ventilators also delivered. Good conversation with Governor Cuomo!
1242824631230308353 2020-03-25 07:44:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just reported that the United States has done far more “testing” than any other nation, by far! In fact, over an eight day span, the United States now does more testing than what South Korea (which has been a very successful tester) does over an eight week span. Great job!
1242787050337832961 2020-03-25 05:14:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrat’s Best &amp; Finest!
1242780126674333697 2020-03-25 04:47:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Gee, that’s too bad. Such a fine guy. Presidential aspirations you know!
1242777450662244352 2020-03-25 04:36:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is really great news! I am so happy I can barely speak. He may have been a terrible presidential candidate and an even worse U.S. Senator, but he is a RINO, and I like him a lot!
1242763375924391936 2020-03-25 03:40:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am working very hard to help New York City &amp; State. Dealing with both Mayor &amp; Governor and producing tremendously for them, including four new medical centers and four new hospitals. Fake News that I won’t help them because I don’t like Cuomo (I do). Just sent 4000 ventilators!

1242528658767654912 2020-03-24 12:08:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Price transparency is so important for the people of our Country. In many ways, it will prove to be as important as healthcare itself. A great issue for both Republicans and Democrats. Hopefully it will be approved!
1242482460140736512 2020-03-24 09:04:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Will be doing a Town Hall on @FoxNews at 12:05 P.M. (Now). I will go on around 1:00 P.M. Enjoy!
1242455267603877894 2020-03-24 07:16:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Our people want to return to work. They will practice Social Distancing and all else, and Seniors will be watched over protectively &amp; lovingly. We can do two things together. THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM! Congress MUST ACT NOW. We will come back strong!
1242432301885198337 2020-03-24 05:45:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congress must approve the deal, without all of the nonsense, today. The longer it takes, the harder it will be to start up our economy. Our workers will be hurt!
1242422012682919937 2020-03-24 05:04:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is not about the ridiculous Green New Deal. It is about putting our great workers and companies BACK TO WORK!

1242394374224392192 2020-03-24 03:14:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The World market for face masks and ventilators is Crazy. We are helping the states to get equipment, but it is not easy.

They are asking for things that have nothing to do with our great workers or companies. They want Open Borders &amp; Green New Deal. Republicans shouldn’t agree!

Forgot to mention that I closed our Country to China (and Europe) very early, long before it was considered acceptable to do so. Sleepy Joe said I was “xenophobic”, but I saved thousands of lives!

1242281182349451264 2020-03-23 19:44:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is the way the @nytimes finished a story on me. “You can see the contrast between the steady, assured, informed and strong leadership that VP Biden (Sleepy Joe) has shown, and the bungling, chaotic and dishonest start-stop approach that Mr. (not Pres.)

1242095933296443395 2020-03-23 07:28:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The New York Times changed headlines 3 times in order to satisfy the Radical Left.

1242056984104521728 2020-03-23 04:53:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will be guided by the wishes of Prime Minister Abe of Japan, a great friend of the United States and a man who has done a magnificent job on the Olympic Venue, as to attending the Olympic Games in Japan. He will make the proper decision!
1241935285916782593 2020-03-22 20:50:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!
1241929664987148289 2020-03-22 20:28:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I watch and listen to the Fake News, CNN, MSDNC, ABC, NBC, CBS, some of FOX (desperately &amp; foolishly pleading to be politically correct), the @nytimes, &amp; the @washingtonpost, and all I see is hatred of me at any cost. Don’t they understand that they are destroying themselves?
1241897485779468288 2020-03-22 18:20:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> My friend (always there when I’ve needed him!), Senator @RandPaul, was just tested “positive” from the Chinese Virus. That is not good! He is strong and will get better. Just spoke to him and he was in good spirits.
1241779803344248835 2020-03-22 10:32:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hard working men and women of @UPS are working overtime to maintain our supply chain and deliver medical supplies to those in need. Your work is critical to the health of our nation, keep it up!
1241760294776561667 2020-03-22 09:14:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@JBPritzker, Governor of Illinois, and a very small group of certain other Governors, together with Fake News @CNN &amp; Concast (MSDNC), shouldn’t be blaming the Federal Government for their own shortcomings. We are there to back you up should you fail, and always will be!
1241739447122776064 2020-03-22 07:52:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Working very well with States and our Nation’s Governors. #TEAMWORK

1241732681366482944 2020-03-22 07:25:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Ford, General Motors and Tesla are being given the go ahead to make ventilators and other metal products, FAST! @fema  Go for it auto execs, lets see how good you are? @RepMarkMeadows @GOPLeader @senatemajldr
1241668853161168897 2020-03-22 03:11:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So true!
1241667793218678784 2020-03-22 03:07:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> That doesn’t sound like Michael, does it?

The FDA has moved mountains - Thank You! Hopefully they will BOTH (H works better with A, International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents).....
1241354162144784384 2020-03-21 06:21:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great story. Thank you to Mr. Young of Jonesboro, Arkansas!

1241097732456099842 2020-03-20 13:22:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Today I spoke with our Nation’s Small Businesses, which employ nearly half of America’s workforce. We are taking the MOST aggressive action in history to deliver fast relief to your businesses and workers. We will always protect our Small Businesses! @SBAgov

1240860872949542912 2020-03-19 21:41:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A Great Guy!
1240859940908138498 2020-03-19 21:37:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Steve is one of the very best in the Senate. He is competing against a failed Democrat Presidential candidate who never got close to 1%, and was sent packing. Had to be talked into this run by Schumer. Bad for 2nd A! I strongly Endorse @SteveDaines!
1240782995209977857 2020-03-19 16:31:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump>  https://t.co/xHttKvdJQy
1240765945968234496 2020-03-19 15:23:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> America’s Private Sector is stepping up to help us be STRONG! Many of the Nation’s distillers, large and small, are producing and donating hand sanitizer to help fight #COVID19. THANK YOU!  https://t.co/bcjKA9Janw
1240764105155391488 2020-03-19 15:16:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU to our Police Officers, Fire Fighters, and EMS who help us defeat the Virus every day. Our proud nation is grateful for the unwavering dedication and sacrifice of our First Responders and their families. TOGETHER we will beat this!

1240622747732127746 2020-03-19 05:54:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We are going to WIN, sooner rather than later!
1240394725783416840 2020-03-18 14:48:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> STRONG &amp; UNITED, WE WILL PREVAIL!  https://t.co/T6UCyaPRIy
1240391871026864130 2020-03-18 14:37:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. Hopefully there will be no need, but we are all in this TOGETHER!
1240380132226928640 2020-03-18 13:50:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you @HerschelWalker!
1240379840987115532 2020-03-18 13:49:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Today I spoke with American physicians and nurses to thank them for their tireless work. Doctors and nurses are at the front lines of this war and are true American HEROES! With their help, America will WIN.
1240355986541613062 2020-03-18 12:14:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...It cannot overcome the dedication of our doctors, nurses, and scientists — and it cannot beat the LOVE, PATRIOTISM, and DETERMINATION of our citizens. Strong and United, WE WILL PREVAIL!
1240355985673392128 2020-03-18 12:14:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I want all Americans to understand: we are at war with an invisible enemy, but that enemy is no match for the spirit and resolve of the American people...
1240347278453411843 2020-03-18 11:40:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> 15 DAYS TO SLOW THE SPREAD!  https://t.co/ytgBP3hJv1
1240303426254372864 2020-03-18 08:45:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you to our great American businesses for going above and beyond to keep our most vulnerable citizens safe!
1240271178692005889 2020-03-18 06:37:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will be, by mutual consent, temporarily closing our Northern Border with Canada to non-essential traffic. Trade will not be affected. Details to follow!
1240269231410774016 2020-03-18 06:30:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....Also, according to the Daily Caller, leading Sleepy Joe Biden in Florida, 48% to 42%.
1240269212871995393 2020-03-18 06:29:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> 95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, 53% overall. Not bad considering I get nothing but Fake &amp; Corrupt News, day and night. “Russia, Russia, Russia”, then “the Ukraine Scam (where’s the Whistleblower?)”, the “Impeachment Hoax”, and more, more, more....
1240265729108303873 2020-03-18 06:16:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The DNC will have gotten their fondest wish and defeated Bernie Sanders, far ahead of schedule. Now they are doing everything possible to be nice to him in order to keep his supporters. Bernie has given up, just like he did last time. He will be dropping out soon! MAGA/KAG
1240243188708839424 2020-03-18 04:46:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the “borders” from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful &amp; false!
1240234698053431305 2020-03-18 04:12:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will be having a news conference today to discuss very important news from the FDA concerning the Chinese Virus!
1240229954044002304 2020-03-18 03:53:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will totally protect your Medicare &amp; Social Security!
1240226752447873027 2020-03-18 03:41:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> For the people that are now out of work because of the important and necessary containment policies, for instance the shutting down of hotels, bars and restaurants, money will soon be coming to you. The onslaught of the Chinese Virus is not your fault! Will be stronger than ever!
1240008233781248002 2020-03-17 13:12:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump>  https://t.co/6gD7l9Po59
1239997820242923521 2020-03-17 12:31:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The world is at war with a hidden enemy. WE WILL WIN!
1239907845719691265 2020-03-17 06:34:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Federal Government is working very well with the Governors and State officials. Good things will happen! #KILLTHEVIRUS
1239906156463652868 2020-03-17 06:27:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Failing  Michigan Governor must work harder and be much more proactive. We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan!
1239889767267008512 2020-03-17 05:22:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Cuomo wants “all states to be treated the same.” But all states aren’t the same. Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all. New York is a very big “hotspot”, West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases. Andrew, keep politics out of it....
1239755298811908096 2020-03-16 20:27:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The “Times” is a disgrace to journalism!
1239753277358686209 2020-03-16 20:19:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great news Lindsey!
1239685852093169664 2020-03-16 15:51:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus. We will be stronger than ever before!
1239650086491230209 2020-03-16 13:29:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I ask all Americans to band together and support your neighbors by not hoarding unnecessary amounts of food and essentials. TOGETHER we will stay STRONG and overcome this challenge!
1239650018832891905 2020-03-16 13:29:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Yesterday I spoke with the great American Grocers and Supply Chain Executives. We are confident that supply will continue to meet demand nationwide. These beacons of our community will remain open for you, no matter what. We are working hard to remove any barriers to that effort!

1239620630523322368 2020-03-16 11:32:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just had a  very good tele-conference with Nation’s Governors. Went very well. Cuomo of New York has to “do more”.
1239567267312152576 2020-03-16 08:00:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Everybody is so well unified and working so hard. It is a beautiful thing to see. They love our great Country. We will end up being stronger than ever before!
1239532209427623936 2020-03-16 05:41:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> God Bless the USA!

1239383648018804739 2020-03-15 19:51:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I must say, that was a VERY boring debate. Biden lied when he said I want to cut Social Security and Medicare. That’s what they ALL said 4 years ago, and nothing happened, in fact, I saved Social Security and Medicare. I will not be cutting, but they will. Be careful!
1239323762987851778 2020-03-15 15:53:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The individual Governors of States, and local officials, must step up their efforts on drive up testing and testing sights, working in conjunction with @CDCgov and the Federal Government!
1239252169150410752 2020-03-15 11:08:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake and Corrupt News never called Google. They said this was not true. Even in times such as these, they are not truthful. Watch for their apology, it won’t happen. More importantly, thank you to Google!
1239242219019735042 2020-03-15 10:29:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So now it is reported that, after destroying his life &amp; the life of his wonderful family (and many others also), the FBI, working in conjunction with the Justice Department, has “lost” the records of General Michael Flynn. How convenient. I am strongly considering a Full Pardon!
1239237382458806277 2020-03-15 10:09:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Can’t believe they are not going after Schumer for the threats he made to our cherished United States Supreme Court, and our two great Justices. If a Republican did that, there would be an endless price to pay. Pathetic!
1239235411463020544 2020-03-15 10:02:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....The USA was never set up for this, just look at the catastrophe of the H1N1 Swine Flu (Biden in charge, 17,000 people lost, very late response time), but it soon will be. Great decision to close our China, and other, borders early. Saved many lives!
1239235409491767298 2020-03-15 10:02:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There will be a News Conference by the CoronaVirus Task Force today at the White House, 5 P.M. @VP  We are working closely with the Governors of our Country’s great States, which are a very big factor. They are working hard, along with us, to get the job properly done.....
1239228460863819778 2020-03-15 09:34:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We are doing very precise Medical Screenings at our airports. Pardon the interruptions and delays, we are moving as quickly as possible, but it is very important that we be vigilant and careful. We must get it right. Safety first!
1239209878469644288 2020-03-15 08:20:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am watching a great and beautiful service by Pastor Jentezen Franklin. Thank you! @Jentezen
1239205277381132290 2020-03-15 08:02:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> TODAY IS A NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER. GOD BLESS EVERYONE!
1239204333851488266 2020-03-15 07:58:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great Job by Judicial Watch. Potentially a treasure trove. Too bad you are not given more help, but it will all work out!
1239202025029734400 2020-03-15 07:49:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This took place in the Rose Garden, just coming out of a cold Winter!
1239201055315025920 2020-03-15 07:45:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Amazing how the Fake News never covers this. No Interest on Student Loans. The Dems are just talk!

1238906131302494215 2020-03-14 12:13:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The @CDCgov has published guidelines on  https://t.co/p9j7kZsD7b to enable every American to respond to this epidemic and to protect themselves, their families and their communities.
1238904264908582914 2020-03-14 12:06:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just had a nice conversation with Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau of Canada. Great to hear that his wonderful wife Sophie is doing very well. The United States and Canada will continue to coordinate closely together on COVID-19.

1238797759161008128 2020-03-14 05:02:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Larry, I am not surprised that Candace was great. I would only be surprised if she wasn’t great!
1238791333252399104 2020-03-14 04:37:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Good teamwork between Republicans &amp; Democrats as the House passes the big CoronaVirus Relief Bill. People really pulled together. Nice to see!

1238603402457812992 2020-03-13 16:10:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Americans are the strongest and most resilient people on earth...We will remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need, and that they are entitled to. No resource will be spared.  https://t.co/gySUqewd4u
1238599373417787394 2020-03-13 15:54:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....No matter where you may be, I encourage you to turn towards prayer in an act of faith. Together, we will easily PREVAIL!
1238599369466753026 2020-03-13 15:54:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> It is my great honor to declare Sunday, March 15th as a National Day of Prayer. We are a Country that, throughout our history, has looked to God for protection and strength in times like these....
1238590988593086464 2020-03-13 15:21:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> At my request, effective midnight tonight, Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, and MSC have all agreed to suspend outbound cruises for thirty days. It is a great and important industry – it will be kept that way!
1238575476916006915 2020-03-13 14:19:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care they need. No resource will be spared!  https://t.co/KcDZ9YoXZE
1238570595710836738 2020-03-13 14:00:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> To unleash the full power of the Federal Government in this effort, today I am officially declaring a National Emergency.  https://t.co/yu2GBcxWD6
1238478818135945216 2020-03-13 07:55:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will be having a news conference today at 3:00 P.M., The White House. Topic: CoronaVirus!
1238478167695863817 2020-03-13 07:52:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> To this point, and because we have had a very strong border policy, we have had 40 deaths related to CoronaVirus. If we had weak or open borders, that number would be many times higher!
1238460927328075778 2020-03-13 06:44:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Federal Reserve must FINALLY lower the Fed Rate to something comparable to their competitor Central Banks. Jay Powell and group are putting us at a decided economic &amp; physiological disadvantage. Should never have been this way. Also, STIMULATE!
1238442385048305664 2020-03-13 05:30:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If you want to get money into the hands of people quickly &amp; efficiently, let them have the full money that they earned, APPROVE A PAYROLL TAX CUT until the end of the year, December 31. Then you are doing something that is really meaningful. Only that will make a big difference!
1238410051758575617 2020-03-13 03:22:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .... Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now. The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go!
1238410044263333894 2020-03-13 03:22:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> For decades the @CDCgov looked at, and studied,  its testing system, but did nothing about it. It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped. President Obama made changes that only complicated things further.....
1238292145242603522 2020-03-12 19:33:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The Obama White House had to immediately issue an apology for Joe Biden’s remarks, and any alarm that he might have caused, an alarm about a Swine Flu outbreak that took 6 months for President Obama to declare a National Emergency, and that killed 12,000 Americans.” @LouDobbs
1238288908431036423 2020-03-12 19:20:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings &amp; a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!
1238283146350809088 2020-03-12 18:58:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just had a great conversation with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I told him that the just completed Olympic venue is magnificent. He has done an incredible job, one that will make him very proud. Good things will happen for Japan and their great Prime Minister. Lots of options!
1238193633825882113 2020-03-12 13:02:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> 108 countries are dealing with the CoronaVirus problem, some of which we are helping!

1238113667754995712 2020-03-12 07:44:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many Republican Senators want me to Veto the FISA Bill until we find out what led to, and happened with, the illegal attempted “coup” of the duly elected President of the United States, and others!
1238046001744826369 2020-03-12 03:15:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Nancy Pelosi all of a sudden doesn’t like the payroll tax cut, but when Obama proposed it she thought it was a brilliant thing that all of the working families would benefit from because if you get a paycheck, you’re going to take home more money.” @kilmeade @foxandfriends
1237924658185469954 2020-03-11 19:13:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hoping to get the payroll tax cut approved by both Republicans and Democrats, and please remember, very important for all countries &amp; businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe. The restriction stops people not goods.

1237861968721010689 2020-03-11 15:04:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Media should view this as a time of unity and strength. We have a common enemy, actually, an enemy of the World, the CoronaVirus. We must beat it as quickly and safely as possible. There is nothing more important to me than the life &amp; safety of the United States!
1237841878889840642 2020-03-11 13:44:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will be addressing the Nation this evening at 9:00 P.M. (Eastern) from the Oval Office.
1237820230296010752 2020-03-11 12:18:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am fully prepared to use the full power of the Federal Government to deal with our current challenge of the CoronaVirus!
1237820044198977536 2020-03-11 12:17:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....We have the greatest healthcare system, experts, scientists and doctors anywhere in the world. Together, we will PREVAIL!
1237820042735226887 2020-03-11 12:17:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I want to thank all of our Great Government officials on the CoronaVirus Task Force who are working around the clock, in response to the CoronaVirus. Continue to check  https://t.co/boZM2NePJW for updates, and follow all recommendations that are available....
1237813728558678026 2020-03-11 11:52:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....Together we are putting into policy a plan to prevent, detect, treat and create a vaccine against CoronaVirus to save lives in America and the world. America will get it done!
1237813727409229824 2020-03-11 11:52:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> America is the Greatest Country in the world. We have the best scientists, doctors, nurses and health care professionals. They are amazing people who do phenomenal things every day....
1237813081394348034 2020-03-11 11:50:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Someone needs to tell the Democrats in Congress that CoronaVirus doesn’t care what party you are in. We need to protect ALL Americans!
1237745593876873217 2020-03-11 07:22:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Vanity Fair Magazine, which will soon be out of business, and their third rate Fake reporters, who make up sources which don’t exist, wrote yet another phony &amp; boring hit piece. The facts are just the opposite. Our team is doing a great job with CoronaVirus!
1237742116564013056 2020-03-11 07:08:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Gavin. Team is doing a great job!

1237603152490147850 2020-03-10 21:55:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Pocahontas, working in conjunction with the Democrat Party, totally destroyed the campaign of Bernie Sanders. If she would have quit 3 days earlier, Sanders would have beaten Biden in a route, it wouldn’t even have been close. They also got two other losers to support Sleepy Joe!
1237581053373497344 2020-03-10 20:28:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU WASHINGTON! #KAG2020  https://t.co/h04VbW71TH

He will be a great Senator for the people of Alabama. Coach Tommy Tuberville, a winner, has my Complete and Total Endorsement. I love Alabama!
1237557409943416834 2020-03-10 18:54:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Tommy Tuberville (@TTuberville) is running for the U.S. Senate from the Great State of Alabama. Tommy was a terrific head football coach at Auburn University. He is a REAL LEADER who will never let MAGA/KAG, or our Country, down! Tommy will protect your Second Amendment....
1237545548430770178 2020-03-10 18:07:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU MICHIGAN! #KAG2020  https://t.co/9Ibuma0JfP

1237498359134466051 2020-03-10 14:59:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Best unemployment numbers in the history of our Country. Best employment number EVER, almost 160 million people working right now. Vote Republican, unless you want to see these numbers obliterated!
1237491395436240897 2020-03-10 14:31:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If you like automobiles, how can you vote for a Democrat who all want to get rid of cars, as quickly as possible, especially if they are powered by gasoline. Remember also, no more than one car per family. I, on the other hand, have new plants being built all over Michigan, Plus!
1237448419284783105 2020-03-10 11:41:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great meeting on Capitol Hill with the @SenateGOP!  https://t.co/eNB8zMRCup
1237419080707170311 2020-03-10 09:44:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you @SenateGOP!  https://t.co/XysOvXbTMF
1237389825520648192 2020-03-10 07:48:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Ronald Reagan’s great economist, the recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, has just said great things about a Payroll Tax Cut!
1237388788776800256 2020-03-10 07:44:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Our CoronaVirus Team has been doing a great job. Even Democrat governors have been VERY complimentary!
1237388340778782725 2020-03-10 07:42:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Nancy Pelosi just said, “I don’t know if we can be ready this week.” In other words, it’s off to vacation for the Do Nothing Democrats. That’s been the story with them for 1 1/2 years!
1237384954004340738 2020-03-10 07:28:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is another Russia, Russia, Russia meeting today. It is headed up by corrupt politician Adam “Shifty” Schiff, so I wouldn’t expect too much! @DHS_Wolf
1237378225417961472 2020-03-10 07:02:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Federal Reserve must be a leader, not a very late follower, which it has been!
1237377697917140992 2020-03-10 07:00:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Our pathetic, slow moving Federal Reserve, headed by Jay Powell, who raised rates too fast and lowered too late, should get our Fed Rate down to the levels of our competitor nations. They now have as much as a two point advantage, with even bigger currency help. Also, stimulate!
1237374729545228288 2020-03-10 06:48:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well deserved Jack. A great honor!
1237374208314834946 2020-03-10 06:46:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> True, with number 1 being more important!
1237368448533004288 2020-03-10 06:23:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Going to be a BAD day for Crazy Bernie!
1237341582145105920 2020-03-10 04:36:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Polls say they BOTH lose to “Trump”.
1237340894610759680 2020-03-10 04:33:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! @foxandfriends blew away the competition of Morning Joke (which did very poorly) on MSDNC (Another Comcast sleaze production), and @CNN’s New Day, in the Morning Television Ratings. A total blowout, but that’s what you get when you treat “Trump” fairly!
1237239192222158848 2020-03-09 21:49:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Fake News!!
1237236320935849985 2020-03-09 21:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Oklahoma, Vote for your GREAT Senator Today. Nobody better than Jim!
1237130072571731968 2020-03-09 14:36:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU, Jim, for your incredible support of our #MAGA Agenda! You are a tremendous Senator for the people of the Great State of Oklahoma and you have my Complete and Total Endorsement!
1237129690877476864 2020-03-09 14:34:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congressman @StevenPalazzo is doing a fantastic job for the people of Mississippi. He strongly supports our #MAGA Agenda. Steven will continue to protect your #2A, &amp; Support our INCREDIBLE Vets &amp; Military. Steven has my Complete Endorsement. VOTE for Steven tomorrow, March 10th!
1237128422712905738 2020-03-09 14:29:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congressman Michael Guest (@GuestCongress) is an incredible fighter for the Great State of Mississippi. Michael is strong on Crime and the Border, he loves our Military and Vets. Michael has my Complete and Total Endorsement! Get out and Vote for Michael tomorrow, March 10th!
1237027356314869761 2020-03-09 07:47:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life &amp; the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!
1237024551294382081 2020-03-09 07:36:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil. That, and the Fake News, is the reason for the market drop!
1237024549046288385 2020-03-09 07:36:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Good for the consumer, gasoline prices coming down!
1237004509156642816 2020-03-09 06:17:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So much FAKE NEWS!
1237004230847868929 2020-03-09 06:16:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The BEST decision made was the toughest of them all - which saved many lives. Our VERY early decision to stop travel to and from certain parts of the world!
1237003145743605761 2020-03-09 06:11:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great job being done by the @VP and the CoronaVirus Task Force. Thank you!
1236980284744241154 2020-03-09 04:40:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Obama/Biden Administration is the most corrupt Administration in the history of our Country!
1236979946175725568 2020-03-09 04:39:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Trump has outmastered the Deep State. He’s light years ahead of us.” MSDNC. I disagree. We have a long way to go. There are still some very bad, sick people in our government - people who do not love our Country (In fact, they hate our Country!).
1236978443042148352 2020-03-09 04:33:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Now the Democrats are trying to smear Bernie with Russia, Russia, Russia. They are driving him Crazy!
1236977607062761472 2020-03-09 04:30:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren singlehandedly destroyed the Bernie Sanders campaign by stripping voters away from his count on Super T. He lost states that he easily would have won if she had dropped out 3 days earlier. The DNC is doing it to Bernie again! Will he ever get angry?
1236976241305169921 2020-03-09 04:24:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Cryin’ Chuck Schumer said, “You will pay the price for this. You won’t know what HIT YOU.” That is far beyond simple rhetoric. That is a physical threat, or at least a threat that you better vote for us.” Trouble ahead!
1236975196642390022 2020-03-09 04:20:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, “The risk is low to the average American.”
1236959207917858819 2020-03-09 03:17:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Working hard Lori!
1236885723946631173 2020-03-08 22:25:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There are no mixed messages, only political weaponization by people like you and your brother, Fredo!
1236778368533700609 2020-03-08 15:18:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Who knows what this means, but it sounds good to me!
1236689044366557184 2020-03-08 09:23:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The New York Times is an embarrassment to journalism. They were a dead paper before I went into politics, and they will be a dead paper after I leave, which will be in 5 years. Fake News is the Enemy of the people!
1236634209516752896 2020-03-08 05:45:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus. We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas, which was a Godsend. V.P. is doing a great job. The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. Sad!
1236523073689567234 2020-03-07 21:24:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you @SenatorTimScott!  https://t.co/7Sp0mj1AL0
1236512502210613249 2020-03-07 20:42:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .....least 5 States &amp; the Nomination. Did the DNC &amp; Dems tell Elizabeth Warren to wait? If so, they were deadly, the race would have been over, &amp; Bernie would have won. Dirty double dealing? Nobody knows for sure, &amp; history will be the judge. But I say, here we go AGAIN, Bernie!
1236512499563999234 2020-03-07 20:42:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We have now learned for sure that the Democrats don’t want anything to do with Crazy Bernie. Rigged? First @amyklobuchar &amp; @PeteButtigieg quit the race &amp; come out for Sleepy Joe BEFORE Super Tuesday. Pocahontas says NO &amp; quits race AFTER ELECTION, thereby depriving Bernie of at..
1236501057192316928 2020-03-07 19:56:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I agree with Joe!

1236135907201294336 2020-03-06 19:45:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you @GovBillLee and @MariaLeeTN. My Administration will always be there for the Great People of Tennessee. Together, we will prevail!  https://t.co/SqvRzbw3TL

1236096307103707136 2020-03-06 17:08:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am pleased to announce that Congressman Mark Meadows will become White House Chief of Staff. I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one....

1236038573087961088 2020-03-06 13:18:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you @GovBillLee. We are a phone call away, and here for you!
1236033562425659396 2020-03-06 12:59:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> My Administration is with you all of the way, Tennessee. We love you!   https://t.co/YYLfZuPWyK
1235955288064135168 2020-03-06 07:47:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Spoke to Governor @GavinNewsom early this morning about the cruise ship quarantined off the California Coast. CoronaVirus test kits have been delivered, testing is taking place now.  https://t.co/Pqda00HVCC
1235952805581447173 2020-03-06 07:38:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> It is FAKE NEWS that @HHSGov @SecAzar is “sidelined” from the great job he is doing on the CoronaVirus Task Force. He has the total confidence of the @VP and myself, and is doing a fantastic job, as the numbers would indicate!
1235945259370041344 2020-03-06 07:08:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will protect your Social Security and Medicare, just as I have for the past 3 years. Sleepy Joe Biden will destroy both in very short order, and he won’t even know he’s doing it!

1235797615041753088 2020-03-05 21:21:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thanks Linda, but they were really good last night!
1235796153981075456 2020-03-05 21:15:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you!
1235774524295131136 2020-03-05 19:49:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> My great honor!
1235770412275032064 2020-03-05 19:33:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Audrey!  https://t.co/2bhoVVoV6r
1235768913692065792 2020-03-05 19:27:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The WALL is well under construction. So far we’re up to 129 miles, and by early next year we will have 500 miles completed!  https://t.co/bXxOnoU4WM
1235766710038298625 2020-03-05 19:18:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We have appointed 220 Federal Judges and two Supreme Court Justices. PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT!  https://t.co/fVw6tJ89Wd
1235765896934821894 2020-03-05 19:15:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you David, a lifelong Democrat from Pennsylvania. We will continue MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and then, KEEP AMERICA GREAT!!!!  https://t.co/hvVfB5cPrG
1235748252185739264 2020-03-05 18:05:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Scranton, Pennsylvania. It was a great evening!  https://t.co/EtzRLoEZHs
1235746729770848256 2020-03-05 17:59:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Tonight’s Fox News Town Hall with @MarthaMacCallum and @BretBaier will rebroadcast at 11:00 P.M. Eastern on @FoxNews. Enjoy!
1235665981709709319 2020-03-05 12:38:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Nan!
1235665090432708608 2020-03-05 12:34:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Gallup just gave us the highest rating ever for the way we are handling the CoronaVirus situation. The April 2009-10 Swine Flu, where nearly 13,000 people died in the U.S., was poorly handled. Ask MSDNC &amp; lightweight Washington failure @RonaldKlain, who the President was then?
1235641895772139523 2020-03-05 11:02:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Department of Education is NOT closing hundreds of schools in rural areas of our Country. This is just more Fake News. We are investing greatly in our schools, and always will!
1235633381595066373 2020-03-05 10:28:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mini Mike, you’re easy!  https://t.co/rxFiqSB9RQ
1235604572850343937 2020-03-05 08:34:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> With approximately 100,000 CoronaVirus cases worldwide, and 3,280 deaths, the United States, because of quick action on closing our borders, has, as of now, only 129 cases (40 Americans brought in) and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!
1235601483367923718 2020-03-05 08:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Joe Biden represents the past. President Trump represents the future.” @LisaMarieBoothe @edhenry @FoxNews
1235598653114511360 2020-03-05 08:10:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren, who was going nowhere except into Mini Mike’s head, just dropped out of the Democrat Primary...THREE DAYS TOO LATE. She cost Crazy Bernie, at least, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Texas. Probably cost him the nomination! Came in third in Mass.
1235596612099084288 2020-03-05 08:02:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy informed me that I was 20 for 20 on Tuesday with respect to my Endorsement of candidates. Sadly, I didn’t get that information from the Fake News Media. They don’t report those things, or the far more than Dems cumulative votes, despite no opposition!
1235594306297253889 2020-03-05 07:53:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “I want to commend the President for how he has handled the CoronaVirus situation, especially his early decision to shut down access into our Country from China, despite strong opposition to that decision.” @SenTomCotton Thank you Tom!
1235588587690676224 2020-03-05 07:30:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Schumer has brought great danger to the steps of the United States Supreme Court!
1235573492004904961 2020-03-05 06:30:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work. This is just more Fake News and disinformation put out by the Democrats, in particular MSDNC. Comcast covers the CoronaVirus situation horribly, only looking to do harm to the incredible &amp; successful effort being made!
1235568602696355840 2020-03-05 06:11:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> As per recent Federal Court ruling, the Federal Government will be withholding funds from Sanctuary Cities. They should change their status and go non-Sanctuary. Do not protect criminals!
1235418846758088704 2020-03-04 20:16:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump>  https://t.co/hmcOfwHgAK

1235385447813197831 2020-03-04 18:03:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will be interviewed by @seanhannity on @FoxNews at 9:10 P.M.
1235375346494644224 2020-03-04 17:23:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Retired Four Star General Jack Keane will receive the PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM next week!
1235370217712300038 2020-03-04 17:03:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There can be few things worse in a civilized, law abiding nation, than a United States Senator openly, and for all to see and hear, threatening the Supreme Court or its Justices. This is what Chuck Schumer just did. He must pay a severe price for this!
1235359627082117120 2020-03-04 16:21:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is a direct &amp; dangerous threat to the U.S. Supreme Court by Schumer. If a Republican did this, he or she would be arrested, or impeached. Serious action MUST be taken NOW!
1235351764737675264 2020-03-04 15:49:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you, keep up the great work!
1235351025349013505 2020-03-04 15:46:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congress has agreed to provide $8 Billion to fight Coronavirus! This means @CDCgov, @HHSGov, and @DHSgov will have the resources they need to Keep America Safe and keep the risk to workers and families very low. This is great news for our Health, our Economy, and our Nation!
1235350184982388737 2020-03-04 15:43:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 9:00 P.M. Eastern on @FoxNews. Enjoy!
1235295497008672769 2020-03-04 12:06:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Pandering Mini Mike Bloomberg, along with his wacky friend, Tom Steyer, have found out the hard way that you can’t buy the election! They both wish they had it to do over again!
1235286435697233925 2020-03-04 11:30:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Today, it was my great honor to address the @LatinoCoalition Legislative Summit. With the hard work, love &amp; devotion of millions of incredible Hispanic-Americans, our Country is thriving, our people are prospering, and our future has never looked brighter!  https://t.co/PJumzqLKGq
1235235070040059904 2020-03-04 08:06:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mini Mike, “Three months ago I entered the race for President to defeat Donald Trump, (and I failed miserably!).
1235232818692792320 2020-03-04 07:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mini Mike Bloomberg will now FIRE Tim O’Brien, and all of the fools and truly dumb people who got him into this MESS. This has been the worst, and most embarrassing, experience of his life...and now on to Sleepy Joe!
1235228511314620416 2020-03-04 07:40:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mini Mike Bloomberg just “quit” the race for President. I could have told him long ago that he didn’t have what it takes, and he would have saved himself a billion dollars, the real cost. Now he will pour money into Sleepy Joe’s campaign, hoping to save face. It won’t work!
1235226619528335369 2020-03-04 07:32:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Mayor of Los Angeles, @ericgarcetti, is dealing with us trying to get the Federal Government to fix the terrible problem he and the Dems have caused with the homeless, and the horrendous effects it is having on the City, which is a mess. I then watch him talk “trash” on me!
1235223911538872323 2020-03-04 07:21:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! If Elizabeth Warren wasn’t in the race, Bernie Sanders would have EASILY won Massachusetts, Minnesota and Texas, not to mention various other states. Our modern day Pocahontas won’t go down in history as a winner, but she may very well go down as the all time great SPOILER!
1235217440285560835 2020-03-04 06:56:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The great people of Montana can have no better VOICE than Senator @SteveDaines. He is doing an incredible job! Whoever the Democrat nominee may be, please understand that I will be working hard with Steve all the way, &amp; last night I was 20 for 20 (per @GOPLeader). WE NEED STEVE!
1235208558666543104 2020-03-04 06:20:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will be going to the Great State of Tennessee on Friday. The USA stands with the people of Tennessee 100%, whatever they need! The tornadoes were of record size &amp; velocity. God bless your loved ones &amp; all of the families affected! Thanks to @GovBillLee &amp; @MarshaBlackburn
1235185319257006080 2020-03-04 04:48:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and then, KEEP AMERICA GREAT!!!!
1235181043881299969 2020-03-04 04:31:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States &amp; then doesn’t have the wisdom or courage to stare down &amp; end the phony Russia Witch Hunt. Recuses himself on FIRST DAY in office, and the Mueller Scam begins!
1235176283740524546 2020-03-04 04:12:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So selfish for Elizabeth Warren to stay in the race. She has Zero chance of even coming close to winning, but hurts Bernie badly. So much for their wonderful liberal friendship. Will he ever speak to her again? She cost him Massachusetts (and came in third), he shouldn’t!
1235171235505598465 2020-03-04 03:52:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrat establishment came together and crushed Bernie Sanders, AGAIN! Even the fact that Elizabeth Warren stayed in the race was devastating to Bernie and allowed Sleepy Joe to unthinkably win Massachusetts. It was a perfect storm, with many good states remaining for Joe!
1235082320161325057 2020-03-03 21:59:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU CALIFORNIA! #KAG2020  https://t.co/7BrkAKYWU0

1235047203464286208 2020-03-03 19:39:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> But they really knew who was going to win!
1235046124328755200 2020-03-03 19:35:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren, other than Mini Mike, was the loser of the night. She didn’t even come close to winning her home state of Massachusetts. Well, now she can just sit back with her husband and have a nice cold beer!
1235043280846381058 2020-03-03 19:23:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The biggest loser tonight, by far, is Mini Mike Bloomberg. His “political” consultants took him for a ride. $700 million washed down the drain, and he got nothing for it but the nickname Mini Mike, and the complete destruction of his reputation. Way to go Mike!

1234949358644289541 2020-03-03 13:10:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am calling on Congress to send me a Bill that fully and permanently funds the LWCF and restores our National Parks. When I sign it into law, it will be HISTORIC for our beautiful public lands. ALL thanks to @SenCoryGardner and @SteveDaines, two GREAT Conservative Leaders!

1234869067892305923 2020-03-03 07:51:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Federal Reserve is cutting but must further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA. It is finally time for the Federal Reserve to LEAD. More easing and cutting!
1234853287712694272 2020-03-03 06:49:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Prayers for all of those affected by the devastating tornadoes in Tennessee. We will continue to monitor the developments. The Federal Government is with you all of the way during this difficult time.
1234848619699810306 2020-03-03 06:30:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mini Mike Bloomberg can never recover from his incompetent debate performances. Also, as mayor he was very bad under pressure - a choker!
1234841094745137154 2020-03-03 06:00:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> New book by @charliekirk11, already number 1, “The MAGA Doctrine”. Really great, SUPPORT CHARLIE KIRK. Buy now!

1234832097065480193 2020-03-03 05:24:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Texas &amp; Oklahoma: Mini Mike Bloomberg will kill your drilling, fracking and pipelines. Petroleum based “anything” is dead. Energy jobs gone. Don’t vote for Mini Mike!
1234728725574561792 2020-03-02 22:34:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....paying higher rates than many others, when we should be paying less. Tough on our exporters and puts the USA at a competitive disadvantage. Must be the other way around. Should ease and cut rate big. Jerome Powell led Federal Reserve has called it wrong from day one. Sad!
1234728724219691008 2020-03-02 22:34:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Australia’s Central Bank cut interest rates and stated it will most likely further ease in order to make up for China’s Coronavirus situation and slowdown. They reduced to 0.5%, a record low. Other countries are doing the same thing, if not more so. Our Federal Reserve has us....
1234700386453409792 2020-03-02 20:41:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you @JackBrewerBSI. We’re with you all the way. The American people know what’s going on, they totally get it.

1234694301734580231 2020-03-02 20:17:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrats in the House should propose a very simple one year Payroll Tax cut. Great for the middle class, great for the USA!

1234524212993372160 2020-03-02 09:01:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only people in favor of Mini Mike continuing with his hapless campaign are me and his political consultants, who are getting richer and richer by the day!

They want to be, unlike their competitors, @CNN &amp; MSDNC (Comcast), Fair &amp; Balanced. When will they ever learn. The Radical Left never even gave @FoxNews permission to partake in their low rated debates!

1234497829298679809 2020-03-02 07:16:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> As usual, Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve are slow to act. Germany and others are pumping money into their economies. Other Central Banks are much more aggressive. The U.S. should have, for all of the right reasons, the lowest Rate. We don’t, putting us at a.....
1234483443712561157 2020-03-02 06:19:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Jack Welch, former Chairman and CEO of GE, a business legend, has died. There was no corporate leader like “neutron” Jack. He was my friend and supporter. We made wonderful deals together. He will never be forgotten. My warmest sympathies to his wonderful wife &amp; family!
1234462291652993032 2020-03-02 04:55:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I was criticized by the Democrats when I closed the Country down to China many weeks ahead of what almost everyone recommended. Saved many lives. Dems were working the Impeachment Hoax. They didn’t have a clue! Now they are fear mongering. Be calm &amp; vigilant!

Only his highly paid consultants, who are laughing all the way to the bank, still support him...And by the way, he did not poll well as mayor in handling crisis!
1234455007765942273 2020-03-02 04:26:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I am meeting with the major pharmaceutical companies today at the White House about progress on a vaccine and cure. Progress being made!

1234284276239261696 2020-03-01 17:07:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Sleepy Joe Biden also said that guns killed 150 million Americans last year, wants to win Georgia on Super Tuesday (not up), and got his speaking location wrong again!

1234278963444375553 2020-03-01 16:46:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Black community brilliantly turned their backs on Mini Mike because they know he is a pandering phony who never did right by them!
1234269356760104961 2020-03-01 16:08:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mini Mike Bloomberg didn’t bring NYC back, as he said in his fake ad. It was @RudyGiuliani who brought NYC back and who also, with his endorsement, got Mini Mike elected (with barely a thank you). A boring mayor who the people couldn’t stand!
1234263037110083587 2020-03-01 15:43:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Pete Buttigieg is OUT. All of his SuperTuesday votes will go to Sleepy Joe Biden. Great timing. This is the REAL beginning of the Dems taking Bernie out of play - NO NOMINATION, AGAIN!
1234225268207898627 2020-03-01 13:13:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are disgusted and embarrassed by the Fake News Media, as headed by the @nytimes, @washingtonpost, @comcast &amp; MSDNC, @ABC, @CBSNews and more. They no longer believe what they see and read, and for good reason. Fake News is, indeed, THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!

It makes a lot of sense to put John Ratcliffe in there (DNI).The Senate should quickly approve him. @DevinNunes @MariaBartiromo  John will do a great job for the American people!
1234211248373403648 2020-03-01 12:17:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A Poll in today’s New York Post says that 77% of “U.S. adults have confidence in their government’s ability to handle the Coronavirus (Number One), compared to other health threats.” 64% for Zika, 58% for Ebola.

1234107011614285824 2020-03-01 05:23:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mini Mike Bloomberg’s consultants and so-called “advisors”(how did that advice work out? Don’t ask!), are on the “gravy train” and all making a fortune for themselves pushing Mini hard, when they knew he never had what it takes. Don’t pay them anymore Mike, they led you down....
1233990259802767360 2020-02-29 21:39:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I would find it hard to believe that failed presidential candidates Tom Steyer, or Mini Mike Bloombeg, would contribute to the Democrat Party, even against me, after the way they have been treated - laughed at &amp; mocked. The real politicians ate them up and spit them out!
1233987865350148097 2020-02-29 21:30:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Tom Steyer who, other than Mini Mike Bloomberg, spent more dollars for NOTHING than any candidate in history, quit the race today proclaiming how thrilled he was to be a part of the the Democrat Clown Show. Go away Tom and save whatever little money you have left!
1233977649552384005 2020-02-29 20:49:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congratulations to Sleepy Joe Biden!
1233976658572566529 2020-02-29 20:45:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Democrats are working hard to destroy the name and reputation of Crazy Bernie Sanders, and take the nomination away from him!
1233908953026908161 2020-02-29 16:16:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Sleepy Joe Biden’s victory in the South Carolina Democrat Primary should be the end of Mini Mike Bloomberg’s Joke of a campaign. After the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates,  Mini Mike now has Biden split up his very few voters, taking many away!

1233587771513507840 2020-02-28 19:00:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A so-called reporter named @JohnJHarwood, who bombed so badly in the 2016 Presidential Debates that I thought he was going to be immediately fired (a Mini Mike type performance), is now with Fake News @CNN. A total loser!

1233489045520625664 2020-02-28 12:28:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Dems are working hard to take the prized nomination away from Bernie. Back room politics, which Bernie is not very good at. His people will not let it happen again!
1233488317049602048 2020-02-28 12:25:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mini Mike is getting slammed. His debates were, perhaps, the worst in presidential debating history. A total phony who disavowed “Stop &amp; Frisk” after swearing by it for years, and even recently. He horribly overused it, &amp; then dropped when running as a Dem. A total phony!

1233405207217876992 2020-02-28 06:54:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> To the people of South Carolina, Tom Steyer is a joke, laughed at by everyone, a total incompetent. He made money in coal, now he “hates” coal. Did you see him fawning over Crazy Bernie? Has no chance, a loser for South Carolina, doesn’t deserve your vote!

1233266386291580931 2020-02-27 21:43:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Do Nothing Democrats were busy wasting time on the Immigration Hoax, &amp; anything else they could do to make the Republican Party look bad, while I was busy calling early BORDER &amp; FLIGHT closings, putting us way ahead in our battle with Coronavirus. Dems called it VERY wrong!
1233256774964273152 2020-02-27 21:05:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So, the Coronavirus, which started in China and spread to various countries throughout the world, but very slowly in the U.S. because President Trump closed our border, and ended flights, VERY EARLY, is now being blamed, by the Do Nothing Democrats, to be the fault of “Trump”.
1233249900927868929 2020-02-27 20:37:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So nice!

1233229450881445889 2020-02-27 19:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Word is that Mini Mike Bloomberg performed so poorly in the two debates, that he is thinking about dropping out of the Democrat Primary. The fact is, he was not true to himself, and the public was able to quickly figure him out. Not a good experience for Mini Mike!
1233220106324451328 2020-02-27 18:39:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congratulations and thank you to our great Vice President &amp; all of the many professionals doing such a fine job at CDC &amp; all other agencies on the Coronavirus situation.

1232434103229640704 2020-02-25 14:36:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> That is because they cover your favorite President relatively well. @CNN &amp; MSDNC are dying in the ratings!
1232425065058164736 2020-02-25 14:00:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> No surprise!
1232405794592714752 2020-02-25 12:43:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A total miscarriage of justice!
1232395209125707776 2020-02-25 12:01:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There has rarely been a juror so tainted as the forewoman in the Roger Stone case. Look at her background. She never revealed her hatred of “Trump” and Stone. She was totally biased, as is the judge. Roger wasn’t even working on my campaign. Miscarriage of justice. Sad to watch!
1232304804820467714 2020-02-25 06:02:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Cryin’ Chuck Schumer is complaining, for publicity purposes only, that I should be asking for more money than $2.5 Billion to prepare for Coronavirus. If I asked for more he would say it is too much. He didn’t like my early travel closings. I was right. He is incompetent!
1232288843757387777 2020-02-25 04:58:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump>  https://t.co/Cfs8RV05Pt
1232155595438018567 2020-02-24 20:09:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....on all Trump, or Trump related, matters! While “elections have consequences”, I only ask for fairness, especially when it comes to decisions made by the United States Supreme Court!
1232155591537254400 2020-02-24 20:09:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Sotomayor accuses GOP appointed Justices  of being biased in favor of Trump.” @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews  This is a terrible thing to say. Trying to “shame” some into voting her way? She never criticized Justice Ginsberg when she called me a “faker”. Both should recuse themselves..
1232130591862247424 2020-02-24 18:29:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ..It has been a scam right from the beginning with the illegally started Mueller Report, FISA, the leaking, lying &amp; more. Schiff should not have access to Intelligence, he is a corrupt pol. “Amazing that they went to Bernie Sanders, but not to President Trump.” @marthamaccallum
1232130587324014593 2020-02-24 18:29:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “U.S. Intelligence official overstated assessment of Russian efforts to help Trump.” @FoxNews @GreggJarrett They supposedly told Crazy Bernie that Russia was looking at him, not me. This is all a big scam between Intel and the Democrats. They want Bernie OUT, &amp; hate “Trump”.
1232067592086487043 2020-02-24 14:19:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Spelled @GiannoCaldwell!

He will be at the Ronald Reagan Library, Simi Valley, California, on Thursday at 6 PM, PT. Check it out!
1232059163938885633 2020-02-24 13:46:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Totally correct!
1232058127740174339 2020-02-24 13:42:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC &amp; World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!
1232054796502343681 2020-02-24 13:28:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Set up by Schiff’s lies &amp; leaks. Same with the Mueller Witch Hunt 3 years ago!

1231713123180007424 2020-02-23 14:51:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Crazy Bernie and the Democrats should see this. I have done far more for the African American community than any President. Secured funding for HBCUs, Criminal Justice Reform, Opportunity Zones, School Choice, Record Low Unemployment, and so much more. THE BEST IS YET TO COME!
1231690059776131084 2020-02-23 13:19:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Jeff Van Drew is a Courageous Leader that left the Do Nothing Democrats to better serve the Great people of New Jersey. HAPPY BIRTHDAY @CongressmanJVD!
1231651294042972160 2020-02-23 10:45:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Are any Democrat operatives, the DNC, or Crooked Hillary Clinton, blaming Russia, Russia, Russia for the Bernie Sanders win in Nevada. If so I suggest calling Bob Mueller &amp; the 13 Angry Democrats to do a new Mueller Report, Democrat Edition. Bob will get to the bottom of it!
1231647192181460993 2020-02-23 10:29:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Somebody please tell incompetent (thanks for my high poll numbers) &amp; corrupt politician Adam “Shifty” Schiff to stop leaking Classified information or, even worse, made up information, to the Fake News Media. Someday he will be caught, &amp; that will be a very unpleasant experience!

1231397086551314432 2020-02-22 17:55:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just another Shifty Schiff leak. Isn’t there a law about this stuff?
1231372451893972993 2020-02-22 16:17:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The Kremlin is reportedly backing Bernie Sanders bid to win the White House.” Jon Scott  @FoxNews  Why didn’t somebody tell me this?
1231366964611866625 2020-02-22 15:55:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Looks like Crazy Bernie is doing well in the Great State of Nevada. Biden &amp; the rest look weak, &amp; no way Mini Mike can restart his campaign after the worst debate performance in the history of Presidential Debates. Congratulations Bernie, &amp; don’t let them take it away from you!

1231236777744257024 2020-02-22 07:18:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Democrats in the Great State of Nevada (Which, because of the Economy, Jobs, the Military &amp; Vets, I will win in November), be careful of Russia, Russia, Russia. According to Corrupt politician Adam “Shifty” Schiff, they are pushing for Crazy Bernie Sanders to win. Vote!
1231221743647436801 2020-02-22 06:18:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “An investigation into NOTHING.” The wonderful @trish_regan on the Mueller Witch Hunt!

1231064642514030594 2020-02-21 19:54:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Simply put, he choked!
1231062039617064960 2020-02-21 19:43:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....The reason for this is that the Do Nothing Democrats, using disinformation Hoax number 7, don’t want Bernie Sanders to get the Democrat Nomination, and they figure this would be very bad for his chances. It’s all rigged, again, against Crazy Bernie Sanders!
1231062038979411970 2020-02-21 19:43:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> MSDNC (Comcast Slime), @CNN and others of the Fake Media, have now added Crazy Bernie to the list of Russian Sympathizers, along with @TulsiGabbard &amp; Jill Stein (of the Green Party), both agents of Russia, they say. But now they report President Putin wants Bernie (or me) to win.
1230982069301329920 2020-02-21 14:26:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community, &amp; every walk of life.

1230908583333597185 2020-02-21 09:34:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So @TeamCavuto has very bad ratings on @foxnews with his Fake guests like A.B.Stoddard and others that still haven’t figured it all out. Will he get the same treatment as his friend Shepherd Smith, who also suffered from the ratings drought?
1230889667853078528 2020-02-21 08:19:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> @SenateGOP Highest Trump Poll Numbers EVER! Thank you!

1230881724445249536 2020-02-21 07:47:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great!
1230879049460764672 2020-02-21 07:36:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Another misinformation campaign is being launched by Democrats in Congress saying that Russia prefers me to any of the Do Nothing Democrat candidates who still have been unable to, after two weeks, count their votes in Iowa. Hoax number 7!

1230701508083122177 2020-02-20 19:51:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you to our great US Ambassador to Germany, @RichardGrenell, for stepping in to serve as acting DNI. I will be nominating a terrific candidate for the job very soon. Stay tuned!

1230611451431153666 2020-02-20 13:53:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Could somebody at @foxnews please explain to Trump hater A.B. Stoddard (zero talent!) and @TeamCavuto, that I won every one of my debates, from beginning to end. Check the polls taken immediately after the debates. The debates got me elected. Must be Fox Board Member Paul Ryan!
1230600551131275264 2020-02-20 13:10:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> It was my great honor to deliver the commencement address at the @LVMPD’s Hope for Prisoners Graduation Ceremony today, where we reaffirmed that America is a nation that believes in REDEMPTION!  https://t.co/WwJ5eHjTzl
1230558752966762496 2020-02-20 10:24:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The real winner last night was Donald Trump.” Mini Mike Bloomberg. I agree!

Mini, there’s even less chance, especially after watching your debate performance last night, of you winning the Democrat nomination...But I hope you do!
1230514772338069504 2020-02-20 07:29:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Kerry and Senator Chris Murphy grossly violated the Logan Act with respect to Iran. If a Republican did what they did, there would be very serious ramifications!
1230513001054097415 2020-02-20 07:22:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “They say Roger Stone lied to Congress.” @CNN  OH, I see, but so did Comey (and he also leaked classified information, for which almost everyone, other than Crooked Hillary Clinton, goes to jail for a long time), and so did Andy McCabe, who also lied to the FBI! FAIRNESS?
1230486093906116609 2020-02-20 05:35:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A really great moment!
1230484215344451586 2020-02-20 05:27:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is the REAL Mini Mike. He admitted, many times, that he is “a fan of Donald Trump. He’s a New York ICON.” Thank you Mike!

1230376522663391232 2020-02-19 22:19:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mini Mike Bloomberg’s debate performance tonight was perhaps the worst in the history of debates, and there have been some really bad ones. He was stumbling, bumbling and grossly incompetent. If this doesn’t knock him out of the race, nothing will. Not so easy to do what I did!

1230177751954382848 2020-02-19 09:10:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Internal REAL Polls show I am beating all of the Dem candidates. The Fake News Polls (here we go again, just like 2016) show losing or tied. Their polls will be proven corrupt on November 3rd, just like the Fake News is corrupt!

1230143683699175424 2020-02-19 06:54:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Is corrupt Bloomberg News going to say what a pathetic debater Mini Mike is, that he doesn’t respect our great farmers, or that he has violated campaign finance laws at the highest and most sinister level with “payoffs” all over the place?
1230141397094690818 2020-02-19 06:45:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Kerry &amp; Murphy illegally violated the Logan Act. This is why Iran is not making a deal. Must be dealt with strongly!
1230135934626058240 2020-02-19 06:23:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There must be JUSTICE. This can never happen to a President, or our Country, again!

1227556935299457024 2020-02-12 03:35:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Fake News @CNN and MSDNC have not surprisingly refused to talk about my record setting number of voters in New Hampshire (and in Iowa). That’s why they are poorly rated Fake News! I will win both states in November.
1227453711540269057 2020-02-11 20:45:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media is looking hard for the Big Democrat Story, but there is nothing too fabulous. Wouldn’t a big story be that I got more New Hampshire Primary Votes than any incumbent president, in either party, in the history of that Great State? Not an insignificant fact!
1227443801599418370 2020-02-11 20:06:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Brad!
1227432921788801024 2020-02-11 19:23:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Bootedgeedge (Buttigieg) is doing pretty well tonight. Giving Crazy Bernie a run for his money. Very interesting!
1227427722441510912 2020-02-11 19:02:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A very bad night for Mini Mike!
1227423994250436609 2020-02-11 18:47:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A lot of Democrat dropouts tonight, very low political I.Q.
1227423392078409728 2020-02-11 18:45:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Who are the four prosecutors (Mueller people?) who cut and ran after being exposed for recommending a ridiculous 9 year prison sentence to a man that got caught up in an investigation that was illegal, the Mueller Scam, and shouldn’t ever even have started? 13 Angry Democrats?
1227420618951479297 2020-02-11 18:34:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Impeachment King Steyer (how did that work out?) spent 200 Million Dollars and got less than 1% of the vote in Iowa, and only 3% of the Vote in New Hampshire. Could it be that something is just plain missing? Not easy to do what I did, is it?
1227417402167742466 2020-02-11 18:21:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, is having a really bad night. I think she is sending signals that she wants out. Calling for unity is her way of getting there, going home, and having a “nice cold beer” with her husband!
1227414377889968128 2020-02-11 18:09:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Whatever happened to Hillary campaign manager Podesta’s BROTHER? Wasn’t he caught, forced to leave his firm, with BIG BAD things to happen? Why did nothing ever happen to him, only to the “other” side?
1227411907478421505 2020-02-11 17:59:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...And a swamp creature with “pull” was just sentenced to two months in jail for a similar thing that they want Stone to serve 9 years for. A phony Mueller Witch Hunt disgrace. Caught!
1227408775855976449 2020-02-11 17:47:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Is this the Judge that put Paul Manafort in SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, something that not even mobster Al Capone had to endure? How did she treat Crooked Hillary Clinton? Just asking!
1227407106652897280 2020-02-11 17:40:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All starting to unravel with the ridiculous 9 year sentence recommendation!
1227271072535498754 2020-02-11 08:39:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> When Jerome Powell started his testimony today, the Dow was up 125, &amp; heading higher. As he spoke it drifted steadily downward, as usual, and is now at -15. Germany &amp; other countries get paid to borrow money. We are more prime, but Fed Rate is too high, Dollar tough on exports.
1227258461106425857 2020-02-11 07:49:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> New Stock Market RECORD. Congratulations, spend your money wisely. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!!!!!
1227226643976065024 2020-02-11 05:43:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great being in New Hampshire last night. I would say that was the biggest political Rally in New Hampshire history. Incredible evening!
1227224631754489857 2020-02-11 05:35:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> BEST USA ECONOMY IN HISTORY!
1227122206783811585 2020-02-10 22:48:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is a horrible and very unfair situation. The real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them. Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!
1227118087775846401 2020-02-10 22:32:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just returned to White House from Dover. Very sad!
1227115435746897920 2020-02-10 22:21:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Nice conflict. Brown dropped out of presidential race FAST. Polled at ZERO!
1227109357726445568 2020-02-10 21:57:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Disgraceful!
1227108771740180480 2020-02-10 21:55:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Should never happen to another President!
1227040292060180481 2020-02-10 17:22:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> TOUGH GUYS FOR TRUMP!  https://t.co/DbjZjGzLWU
1227039892489805826 2020-02-10 17:21:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU NEW HAMPSHIRE!   https://t.co/dvZq0UPjHI
1226965160692191233 2020-02-10 12:24:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “A lot of people feel defeated...Trump always wins. It seems like nothing can stop him.” Danny Villazon  @nytimes @DanaPerino @FoxNews  But isn’t that what you want from your President?
1226958810989965312 2020-02-10 11:59:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wall Street Journal Editorial: “She (Crazy Nancy) aimed at Trump and hit Uncle Joe.”
1226875644325265413 2020-02-10 06:28:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Meeting with U.S. Governors in a short while. All States are doing well. “Thank you Mr. President.”
1226874798715949057 2020-02-10 06:25:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you to @mirandadevine of the New York Post for your interesting (and correct) column today. “Trump has gained 20 points since Impeachment began in October. He gets 67% on economy. Nonwhite approval of Trump is also at a high: 28%, up 10 points in a year. Nice one, Nancy.”
1226857034601115650 2020-02-10 05:14:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hope the Fake News, which never discusses it, is talking about the big crowds forming for my New Hampshire Rally tonight. They won’t!
1226847711703584768 2020-02-10 04:37:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Because of how badly they did with the Impeachment Hoax, AOC will primary Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, and win, and Jerry Nadler has a good chance of losing to his far left primary opponent! It is all getting quite interesting. Pelosi will lose the House, AGAIN! My poll numbers great.
1226835190569414657 2020-02-10 03:47:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> 95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, a Record! 53% overall (plus add 9 points?). Corrupt Democrat politicians have brought me to highest polling numbers ever with the Impeachment Hoax. Thank you Nancy!
1226830302485630977 2020-02-10 03:28:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Will be in Manchester, New Hampshire, tonight for a big Rally. Want to shake up the Dems a little bit - they have a really boring deal going on. Still waiting for the Iowa results, votes were fried. Big crowds in Manchester!
1226595698793230348 2020-02-09 11:56:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and then, KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
1226595322174083072 2020-02-09 11:54:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> DRAIN THE SWAMP!
1226594759436881921 2020-02-09 11:52:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....This is the biggest political crime in American History, by far. SIMPLY PUT, THE PARTY IN POWER ILLEGALLY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN, BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE ELECTION, IN ORDER TO CHANGE OR NULLIFY THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION. IT CONTINUED ON WITH THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX. Terrible!
1226594751132114945 2020-02-09 11:52:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> FBI Director Christopher Wray just admitted that the FISA Warrants and Survailence of my campaign were illegal. So was the Fake Dossier. THEREFORE, THE WHOLE SCAM INVESTIGATION, THE MUELLER REPORT AND EVERYTHING ELSE FOR THREE YEARS, WAS A FIXED HOAX. WHO PAYS THE PRICE?....
1226591267817185280 2020-02-09 11:38:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So good to see that Republicans will be winning the Great State of Alabama Senate Seat back, now that lightweight Senator @DougJones cast a partisan vote for the Impeachment Hoax. Thought his boss, Cryin’ Chuck, would have forced him to vote against the Hoax. A Do Nothing Stiff!
1226586575112413184 2020-02-09 11:20:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@LarrySabato is much better at giving you the answer after everything is finished and the final result is in, than he is at telling you what is going to happen because, in fact, he doesn’t have a clue!
1226583877159989249 2020-02-09 11:09:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Sabato got it all wrong last time, never came close to understanding the Trump Voter. Actually it’s simple, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and then, KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
1226563498479640576 2020-02-09 09:48:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “They (Conservatives) thought the merits of the Impeachment case were weak, and therefore his (Romney’s) judgement is questioned.” @MZHemingway @HowardKurtz @FoxNews
1226537476476502016 2020-02-09 08:04:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They are really mad at Senator Joe Munchkin in West Virginia. He couldn’t understand the Transcripts. Romney could, but didn’t want to!
1226535948189675521 2020-02-09 07:58:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Romney hurt some very good Republican Senators, and he was wrong about the Impeachment Hoax. No clue!
1226534052708130820 2020-02-09 07:51:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Yes!!!!!
1226532054461972480 2020-02-09 07:43:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is so true!
1226531801042169856 2020-02-09 07:42:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This will never get old!
1226528994394288128 2020-02-09 07:31:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> DeFace the Nation will tell @LindseyGrahamSC that he must start up Judiciary and not stop until the job is done. Clean up D.C. now, last chance!
1226525699542061058 2020-02-09 07:18:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I grew up in New York City and, over many years, got to watch how GREAT NYC’s “Finest” are. Now, because of weak leadership at Governor &amp; Mayor, stand away (water thrown at them) regulations, and lack of support, our wonderful NYC police are under assault. Stop this now!
1226516098142568450 2020-02-09 06:40:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Dems are crazed, they will do anything. Honesty &amp; truth don’t matter to them. They are badly wounded. Iowa vote count was a disaster for them!
1226514695579893761 2020-02-09 06:34:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Leading also in New Hampshire and most states. The Fake News hates to report this, but you will see on November 3rd.
1226360224145080321 2020-02-08 20:20:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The feeling of many about @MittRomney!  https://t.co/GZYxwe4FJ3
1226324080170848256 2020-02-08 17:56:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you to everyone for all of the great reviews I have gotten on my State of the Union Speech. It was an immense honor for me to have presented it to you and the citizens of our very strong and wonderful Country!
1226314556399591424 2020-02-08 17:19:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...But, just like the people of West Virginia will no longer look at weak &amp; pathetic Joe Manchin the same (I got the Pension Bill approved, Manchin couldn’t do it), the wonderful people of Utah will never look at “grandstander” Mitt Romney with anything but contempt &amp; disgust!
1226314543334350848 2020-02-08 17:19:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Can’t say I mind the fact that the great people of West Virginia are furious at their puppet Democrat Senator, Joe Manchin. They will never forget his phony vote on the Impeachment Hoax. All he had to do is read the Transcripts, sadly, which he wouldn’t understand anyway.....
1226308565557706753 2020-02-08 16:55:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Law Enforcement has been notified. Be careful tough guys who you play with!
1226296531113955331 2020-02-08 16:07:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great lineup on @FoxNews tonight with @JesseBWatters, @JudgeJeanine and &amp; @greggutfeld. All starts at 8:00 P.M. Will be discussing and explaining the Impeachment Hoax!
1226291413610045443 2020-02-08 15:47:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great coach and a fantastic guy. His endorsement of me in Indiana was a very big deal!
1226251504086065152 2020-02-08 13:08:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Pete Rose played Major League Baseball for 24 seasons, from 1963-1986, and had more hits, 4,256, than any other player (by a wide margin). He gambled, but only on his own team winning, and paid a decades long price. GET PETE ROSE INTO THE BASEBALL HALL OF FAME. It’s Time!
1226231262928678915 2020-02-08 11:48:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Total and complete Endorsement for Debbie Lesko! @RepDLesko  Love Arizona.
1226229268830662656 2020-02-08 11:40:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Governor Cuomo wanted to see me this weekend. He just canceled. Very hard to work with New York - So stupid. All they do is sue me all the time!
1226219499847811072 2020-02-08 11:01:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will not be touching your Social Security or Medicare in Fiscal 2021 Budget. Only the Democrats will destroy them by destroying our Country’s greatest ever Economy!
1226214932494114816 2020-02-08 10:43:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...the worst weeks ever.” She could have had a much better week if Crazy Nancy, who is the most overrated person in politics (going to lose the House a second time), didn’t bring the phony &amp; corrupt Impeachment Hoax. Dems can’t do anything right, just look at the Iowa vote count!
1226214925246324736 2020-02-08 10:43:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .@RepDebDingell, who called me, tears flowing, to thank me for rolling out the maximum “Red Carpet” for the funeral of her husband, then voted against me on the partisan Impeachmen Hoax, said “everybody (Dems) wants to get out of town. This has been, in my whole career, one of...
1226166432431558656 2020-02-08 07:30:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only way to stop the crazed Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats “is for the Republican Senate to run an offense here”. @LeeSmithDC  @IngrahamAngle  @FoxNews So true, although the Dems Hoaxes &amp; Witch Hunts have driven up Republican Polls, and mine, mightily!
1226162962873962503 2020-02-08 07:16:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Crazy Nancy Pelosi’s Impeachment Hoax has lifted Republican Congressional Polls (she lost the House once before!), and my Polls, WAY UP, which was expected, but it has had a great effect on Republican Senate races, including North Carolina, Kentucky, Colorado and Arizona. Thanks!
1226159743456161795 2020-02-08 07:03:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Iowa for the RECORD vote we just received in the Primary. The Dems were 25% down (although their votes are all fried!).
1226154003551178752 2020-02-08 06:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....was given a horrendous report by his superior, the man he reported to, who publicly stated that Vindman had problems with judgement, adhering to the chain of command and leaking information. In other words, “OUT”.
1226154000971681795 2020-02-08 06:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Fake News @CNN &amp; MSDNC keep talking about “Lt. Col.” Vindman as though I should think only how wonderful he was. Actually, I don’t know him, never spoke to him, or met him (I don’t believe!) but, he was very insubordinate, reported contents of my “perfect” calls incorrectly, &amp;...
1226119343957856256 2020-02-08 04:23:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Not good!

1225923945691537408 2020-02-07 15:26:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> After years building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding OUR Country. From our inner cities to our rural communities, the forgotten men and women of America are forgotten NO LONGER! #OpportunityNow  https://t.co/qShbwaCaPd
1225901404600049664 2020-02-07 13:57:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....always continue. Every Republican Senator except Romney, many highly religious people, all very smart, voted against the Impeachment Hoax. @SenCapito was all in (a great person). I was told by many that Manchin was just a puppet for Schumer &amp; Pelosi. That’s all he is!
1225901400573513728 2020-02-07 13:57:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I was very surprised &amp; disappointed that Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted against me on the Democrat’s totally partisan Impeachment Hoax. No President has done more for the great people of West Virginia than me (Pensions), and that will....
1225872068832628737 2020-02-07 12:00:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great to be in Charlotte, North Carolina as we expand and grow this unprecedented economic momentum. Today, we launched a brand new nationwide campaign to revitalize under-served cities and towns across America – it’s called OPPORTUNITY NOW!  https://t.co/jh2Ve6BUtJ
1225839566197641216 2020-02-07 09:51:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Another win just in. Nervous Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress sued me, thrown out. This one unanimous, in the D.C. Circuit. Witch Hunt!
1225822965788532737 2020-02-07 08:45:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! #PromisesMadePromisesKept🇺🇸  https://t.co/yIOxpzCNb7
1225820694723862528 2020-02-07 08:36:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Iowa and New Hampshire will not be moved from the Primary Schedule as long as I am President. Great tradition!
1225820258797314048 2020-02-07 08:34:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Off to North Carolina!  https://t.co/dreH1rw3sz
1225819491860393984 2020-02-07 08:31:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrat Party has given up on counting votes in Iowa. Looks like it all got computer “fried”. Nobody knows who the real winner is. Maybe it’s Sleepy Joe, but it’s not looking that way. They lost millions &amp; millions of dollars, all for NOTHING. But I WON Iowa big!

1225766149473947651 2020-02-07 04:59:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I think they should blame RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA again! If they can’t count votes properly, how are they going to run U.S. HealthCare?
1225764923948634113 2020-02-07 04:55:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Welcome back James!
1225763059777638403 2020-02-07 04:47:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Very true, thank you Ted &amp; John. I love Texas!
1225761032376901632 2020-02-07 04:39:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> So do I!
1225743061004771329 2020-02-07 03:28:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Don’t worry, it won’t happen!

Great discipline is taking place in China, as President Xi strongly leads what will be a very successful operation. We are working closely with China to help!
1225728755248828416 2020-02-07 02:31:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just had a long and very good conversation by phone with President Xi of China. He is strong, sharp and powerfully focused on leading the counterattack on the Coronavirus. He feels they are doing very well, even building hospitals in a matter of only days. Nothing is easy, but...

Congress and previous Administrations have long failed to find lasting solutions – my Administration is committed to exploring innovative approaches – I’m confident we can get it done!

1225288731235700737 2020-02-05 21:22:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Had failed presidential candidate @MittRomney devoted the same energy and anger to defeating a faltering Barack Obama as he sanctimoniously does to me, he could have won the election. Read the Transcripts!
1225284559488585729 2020-02-05 21:06:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> @nytimes “The Votes Were A Resounding Victory For Mr. Trump.” True, but the Impeachment Hoax was just a continuation of the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats corrupt practices!

1225179058000089090 2020-02-05 14:07:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will be making a public statement tomorrow at 12:00pm from the @WhiteHouse to discuss our Country’s VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax!

1225077274816471042 2020-02-05 07:22:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The Democrats want to run a Country, and they can’t run a Caucus.” Brad Blakeman @FoxNews  Iowa is a complete disaster for the Dems. They should bring in Mini Mike Bloomberg ASAP!
1225046222123171841 2020-02-05 05:19:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Jonathan, and great job!
1225041277533728768 2020-02-05 04:59:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> It was a great and triumphant evening for our Country. Thank you for all of the nice remarks and wonderful reviews of my State of the Union Speech. It was my great honor to have done it!

1224724275900375042 2020-02-04 07:59:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> My Approval Rating in the Republican Party = 95%, a record! Big Iowa win. Approval Rating overall = 53%, a new high. With our great Economy and other major successes, would be 20 points higher without the phony Witch Hunts and Hoaxes???
1224722351125823491 2020-02-04 07:52:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Market up big today on very good economic news. JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!
1224702718754856960 2020-02-04 06:34:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrat Party in Iowa really messed up, but the Republican Party did not. I had the largest re-election vote in the history of that great state, by far, beating President Obama’s previous record by a lot. Also, 97% Plus of the vote! Thank you Iowa!
1224699832901799939 2020-02-04 06:22:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> When will the Democrats start blaming RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, instead of their own incompetence for the voting disaster that just happened in the Great State of Iowa?
1224685852133031936 2020-02-04 05:27:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> It is not the fault of Iowa, it is the Do Nothing Democrats fault. As long as I am President, Iowa will stay where it is. Important tradition!
1224657196392370177 2020-02-04 03:33:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster. Nothing works, just like they ran the Country. Remember the  5 Billion Dollar Obamacare Website, that should have cost 2% of that. The only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is “Trump”.
1224550106462138368 2020-02-03 20:27:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big WIN for us in Iowa tonight. Thank you!
1224533067156590592 2020-02-03 19:20:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many people do not know what a great guy &amp; fantastic political talent the great Rush Limbaugh is. There is nobody like him. Looking for a speedy recovery for our friend!

1224377770983284737 2020-02-03 09:03:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Where’s the Whistleblower? Where’s the second Whistleblower? Where’s the Informer? Why did Corrupt politician Schiff MAKE UP my conversation with the Ukrainian President??? Why didn’t the House do its job? And sooo much more!
1224375193595981824 2020-02-03 08:52:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
1224375060250746880 2020-02-03 08:52:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
1224374908710420480 2020-02-03 08:51:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Republicans in Iowa, go out and Caucus today. Your great Trade Deals with China, Mexico, Canada, Japan, South Korea and more, are DONE. Great times are coming, after waiting for decades, for our Farmers, Ranchers, Manufacturers and ALL. Nobody else could have pulled this off!
1224372633233428489 2020-02-03 08:42:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I hope Republicans &amp; the American people realize that the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax is exacty that, a Hoax. Read the Transcripts, listen to what the President &amp; Foreign Minister of Ukraine said (“No Pressure”). Nothing will ever satisfy the Do Nothing, Radical Left Dems!
1224317265702801408 2020-02-03 05:02:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The DNC on Bernie Sanders, “Looks like they’re going to do it to him again, doesn’t it?” @SteveDoocy @foxandfriends

1224119370839994369 2020-02-02 15:56:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I promised to restore hope in America. That includes the least among us. Together, let’s KEEP AMERICA GREAT!   Text TRUMP to 88022 if you liked our Super Bowl ad!  https://t.co/Lgjt53B7QX
1224108553977368577 2020-02-02 15:13:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ENJOY THE GAME USA, OUR COUNTRY IS DOING GREAT!
1224064206535843843 2020-02-02 12:17:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> My @SuperBowl Interview at 3:30 P.M. on @foxnetworks. Enjoy!
1223839756234215424 2020-02-01 21:25:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mini Mike is now negotiating both to get on the Democrat Primary debate stage, and to have the right to stand on boxes, or a lift, during the debates. This is sometimes done, but really not fair!
1223837731056427009 2020-02-01 21:17:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the ads you are watching were paid for by Mini Mike Bloomberg. He is going nowhere, just wasting his money, but he is getting the DNC to rig the election against Crazy Bernie, something they wouldn’t do for @CoryBooker and others. They are doing it to Bernie again, 2016.
1223836174294441984 2020-02-01 21:10:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mini Mike is part of the Fake News. They are all working together. In fact, Bloomberg isn’t covering himself (too boring to do), or other Dems. Only Trump. That sounds fair! It’s all the Fake News Media, and that’s why nobody believes in them any more.
1223834666031046656 2020-02-01 21:04:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, don’t want justice when pushing the Impeachment Hoax, they only want to destabilize the Republican Party so they can do better in the 2020 election, &amp; that includes the House &amp; Senate. They are playing with the people by taking it this far!
1223830637712486400 2020-02-01 20:48:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Correct!
1223828931914207233 2020-02-01 20:42:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thanks for your invaluable help Chuck!
1223825601796214784 2020-02-01 20:28:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wall is moving along strong, tall and quickly. Thank you Jim for all of your help!
1223824629472604162 2020-02-01 20:25:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you John!
1223824431228837888 2020-02-01 20:24:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Happy birthday to a wonderful man &amp; friend!
1223640662689689602 2020-02-01 08:14:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Getting a little exercise this morning!  https://t.co/fyAAcbhbgk
1223602537200345088 2020-02-01 05:42:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Trump poll numbers are the highest since election, despite constant phony Witch Hunts! Tens of thousands of people attending rallies (which the Fake News never mentions) to see “The Greatest Show On Earth”. Fun because USA is WINNING AGAIN!
1223399034552930305 2020-01-31 16:13:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> No matter what you give to the Democrats, in the end, they will NEVER be satisfied. In the House, they gave us NOTHING!
1223381882902986752 2020-01-31 15:05:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Democrats = 17 Witnesses. Republicans = 0 Witnesses.
1223351951963967488 2020-01-31 13:06:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats keep chanting “fairness”, when they put on the most unfair Witch Hunt in the history of the U.S. Congress. They had 17 Witnesses, we were allowed ZERO, and no lawyers. They didn’t do their job, had no case. The Dems are scamming America!
1223252952787361792 2020-01-31 06:33:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Incredible numbers!
1223250897414905856 2020-01-31 06:25:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Nadler ripped final argument away from Schiff, thinks Shifty did a terrible job. They are fighting big time!
1223099086389121026 2020-01-30 20:22:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THE BEST IS YET TO COME!  https://t.co/SOn6wRV9Zs
1223082623351713792 2020-01-30 19:16:35 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Americans across the political spectrum are disgusted by the Washington Democrats’ Partisan Hoaxes, Witch Hunts, &amp; Con Jobs. Registered Democrats and Independents are leaving the Democrat Party in droves, &amp; we are welcoming these voters to the Republican Party w/ wide open arms!  https://t.co/UCdQXY3vPn
1223080264747737088 2020-01-30 19:07:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Washington Dems have spent the last 3 years trying to overturn the last election – and we will make sure they face another crushing defeat in the NEXT ELECTION. Together, we are going to win back the House, we are going to hold the Senate, &amp; we are going to keep the White House!  https://t.co/VshQceiwUA
1223079479393697792 2020-01-30 19:04:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> To keep America Safe, we have fully rebuilt the U.S. Military – it is now stronger, more powerful, and more lethal than ever before. Thanks to the courage of American Heroes, the ISIS Caliphate has been DESTROYED &amp; its founder &amp; leader – the animal known as al-Baghdadi – is DEAD!  https://t.co/9LXDf6mJKf

1222982067799121926 2020-01-30 12:37:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> BIGGEST TRADE DEAL EVER MADE, the USMCA, was signed yesterday and the Fake News Media barely mentioned it. They never thought it could be done. They have zero credibility!
1222981385520140288 2020-01-30 12:34:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Just landed in Michigan. Car companies, and many others, are building and expanding here. Great to see!

1222907250383245320 2020-01-30 07:39:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Schiff blasted for not focusing on California homeless.” @foxandfriends  His District is in terrible shape. He is a corrupt pol who only dreams of the Impeachment Hoax. In my opinion he is mentally deranged!

1222670610867916804 2020-01-29 15:59:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> With Votes in the House tomorrow, Democrats want to make it harder for Presidents to defend America, and stand up to, as an example, Iran. Protect our GREAT COUNTRY!

1222589334739673088 2020-01-29 10:36:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> USMCA is a massive win for American manufacturers and auto workers!  https://t.co/eOgFm31cAo
1222547304491646976 2020-01-29 07:49:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They will never be satisfied!
1222546813099659264 2020-01-29 07:47:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The best evidence is the Transcript itself.”  Brad Blakeman  @FoxNews
1222544696964263936 2020-01-29 07:39:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is much talk that certain Democrats are going to be voting with Republicans on the Impeachment Hoax, so that the Senate can get back to the business of taking care of the American people. Sorry, but Cryin’ Chuck Schumer will never let that happen!
1222543172192129024 2020-01-29 07:33:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> On the Iraq War Resolution being voted on tomorrow in the House of Represenatives, we are down to 5000 soldiers, and going down, and I want everyone, Republican and Democrat, to vote their HEART!
1222509768683720706 2020-01-29 05:20:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mark Penn, Harris Poll: “It’s time to end the Impeachment Trial.” @foxandfriends  Just another political Hoax by the Dems!
1222503732501499904 2020-01-29 04:56:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Remember Republicans, the Democrats already had 17 witnesses, we were given NONE! Witnesses are up to the House, not up to the Senate. Don’t let the Dems play you!
1222496715422433281 2020-01-29 04:28:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....many more mistakes of judgement, gets fired because frankly, if I listened to him, we would be in World War Six by now, and goes out and IMMEDIATELY writes a nasty &amp; untrue book. All Classified National Security. Who would do this?
1222496705763008515 2020-01-29 04:28:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> For a guy who couldn’t get approved for the Ambassador to the U.N. years ago, couldn’t get approved for anything since, “begged” me for a non Senate approved job, which I gave him despite many saying “Don’t do it, sir,” takes the job, mistakenly says “Libyan Model” on T.V., and..
1222487526780346370 2020-01-29 03:51:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Democrats admitting the Impeachment Hoax!
1222484885627076610 2020-01-29 03:41:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you!
1222385653029261312 2020-01-28 21:07:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why didn’t John Bolton complain about this “nonsense” a long time ago, when he was very publicly terminated. He said, not that it matters, NOTHING!
1222344928530968576 2020-01-28 18:25:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> No matter how many witnesses you give the Democrats, no matter how much information is given, like the quickly produced Transcripts, it will NEVER be enough for them. They will always scream UNFAIR. The Impeachment Hoax is just another political CON JOB!

1222186473849544704 2020-01-28 07:55:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fed should get smart &amp;  lower the Rate to make our interest competitive with other Countries which pay much lower even though we are, by far, the high standard. We would then focus on paying off &amp; refinancing debt! There is almost no inflation-this is the time (2 years late)!

1222183788924502017 2020-01-28 07:44:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> .....So, what the hell has happened to @FoxNews. Only I know! Chris Wallace and others should be on Fake News CNN or MSDNC. How’s Shep Smith doing? Watch, this will be the beginning of the end for Fox, just like the other two which are dying in the ratings. Social Media is great!
1222183788211470336 2020-01-28 07:44:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Really pathetic how @FoxNews is trying to be so politically correct by loading the airwaves with Democrats like Chris Van Hollen, the no name Senator from Maryland. He has been on forever playing up the Impeachment Hoax. Dems wouldn’t even give Fox their low ratings debates....

1221805273695780864 2020-01-27 06:40:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Schiff must release the IG report, without changes or tampering, which is said to be yet further exoneration of the Impeachment Hoax. He refuses to give it. Does it link him to Whistleblower? Why is he so adamant?

1221764212873224193 2020-01-27 03:57:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrat controlled House never even asked John Bolton to testify. It is up to them, not up to the Senate!

This is another reason for the Senate to repudiate this House Impeachment as its own abuse of power.” A partisan Hoax!

1221419910175301633 2020-01-26 05:09:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Impeachment Hoax is a massive election interference the likes of which has never been seen before.

1220454103937167361 2020-01-23 13:11:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> On my way, see you soon!
1220453276275150855 2020-01-23 13:08:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Crazy Bernie takes the lead in the Democrat Primaries, but it is looking more and more like the Dems will never allow him to win! Will Sleepy Joe be able to stumble across the finish line?
1220453267509055490 2020-01-23 13:08:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Democrats are going to destroy your Social Security. I have totally left it alone, as promised, and will save it!
1220452340555309066 2020-01-23 13:04:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A poll of Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats just came out in Florida. Nice results!  https://t.co/YYo9CxWsVH

1220428541197799424 2020-01-23 11:30:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The United States looks forward to welcoming Prime Minister @Netanyahu &amp; Blue &amp; White Chairman @Gantzbe to the @WhiteHouse next week. Reports about details and timing of our closely-held peace plan are purely speculative.
1220410391668371457 2020-01-23 10:18:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrats don’t want a Witness Trade because Shifty Schiff, the Biden’s, the fake Whistleblower(&amp; his lawyer), the second Whistleblower (who vanished after I released the Transcripts), the so-called “informer”, &amp; many other Democrat disasters, would be a BIG problem for them!
1220379537155948544 2020-01-23 08:15:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “This is all about undermining the next Election.” Liz Peek, @FoxNews
1220336692378394624 2020-01-23 05:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....during his hopeless “presidential” campaign. They will remain silent! The fact is, when Mini losses, he will be spending very little of his money on these “clowns” because he will consider himself to be the biggest clown of them all - and he will be right!
1220336691539599361 2020-01-23 05:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mini Mike Bloomberg is playing poker with his foolhardy and unsuspecting Democrat rivals. He says that if he loses (he really means when!) in the primaries, he will spend money helping whoever the Democrat nominee is. By doing this, he figures, they won’t hit him as hard....
1220329778810687489 2020-01-23 04:57:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrats &amp; Shifty Schiff, whose presentation to the Senate was loaded with lies and misrepresentations, are refusing to state that the Obama Administration withheld aid from many countries including Ukraine, Pakistan, Philippines, Egypt, Honduras, &amp; Mexico. Witch Hunt!
1220328946736226305 2020-01-23 04:54:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> No matter what you give to the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, it will never be enough!
1220328518288052225 2020-01-23 04:52:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrat House would not give us lawyers, or not one witness, but now demand that the Republican Senate produce the witnesses that the House never sought, or even asked for? They had their chance, but pretended to rush. Most unfair &amp; corrupt hearing in Congressional history!
1220327641364029440 2020-01-23 04:49:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In an Impeachment, you can’t use a work of fiction as the theory for the case, filling in gaps with presumptions against the President. It was a weak presentation, self indulgent, &amp; he didn’t deliver the goods.” Robert Charles, @HeatherChilders @FoxNews

1220326789182033920 2020-01-23 04:45:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Attorney Generals from 21 States are urging the Senate to reject Impeachment. They say the Articles have legal &amp; factual problems, and the Democrats case sets a dangerous historical precedent. “EVEN AN UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT UNDERMINES THE INTEGRITY.....

1220061617561300994 2020-01-22 11:12:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Will be Great!
1220060590703611907 2020-01-22 11:08:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great working with you Maria!
1220044230065655808 2020-01-22 10:03:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> One of the many great things about our just signed giant Trade Deal with China is that it will bring both the USA &amp; China closer together in so many other ways. Terrific working with President Xi, a man who truly loves his country. Much more to come!
1220018651362779136 2020-01-22 08:21:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Heading back to Washington from @Davos , Switzerland. Very successful (for USA) trip!

1219974660915388416 2020-01-22 05:26:39 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They are taking the nomination away from Bernie for a second time. Rigged!
1219973879692713989 2020-01-22 05:23:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Steyer is a major loser. Just doesn’t get it. This is second time with Bernie!
1219966918725074944 2020-01-22 04:55:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big story. Hope Fake News covers it!
1219963910620680192 2020-01-22 04:43:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Their case was so “overwhelming” in the House that they need &amp; demand Witnesses in the Senate!
1219916272441470976 2020-01-22 01:34:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ENJOY!

1219433612753289216 2020-01-20 17:36:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Everyone said it couldn’t be done. But for the first time in a generation, there will be direct flights between Serbia and Kosovo. Another win. Thanks to @WHNSC Ambassador Robert O’Brien and Ambassador @RichardGrenell!  https://t.co/0qSLryG96B

1219394967304581120 2020-01-20 15:03:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Nancy can’t fix it. The Do Nothing Dems have done great harm to our Country!
1219351907627667456 2020-01-20 12:12:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will NEVER allow our great Second Amendment to go unprotected, not even a little bit!
1219348788973838336 2020-01-20 11:59:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> It was exactly three years ago today, January 20, 2017,  that I was sworn into office. So appropriate that today is also MLK jr DAY. African-American Unemployment is the LOWEST in the history of our Country, by far. Also, best Poverty, Youth, and Employment numbers, ever. Great!
1219332022826606592 2020-01-20 10:53:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...And they say you can add 7% to 10% to all Trump numbers! Who knows?
1219330940461309952 2020-01-20 10:48:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Two stone cold losers from Amazon WP. Almost every story is a made up lie, just like corrupt pol Shifty Schiff, who fraudulently made up my call with Ukraine. Fiction!
1219304652438675456 2020-01-20 09:04:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> USA! USA! USA!
1219286662221651970 2020-01-20 07:52:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Cryin’ Chuck Schumer is now asking for “fairness”, when he and the Democrat House members worked together to make sure I got ZERO fairness in the House. So, what else is new?
1219285375736328192 2020-01-20 07:47:41 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t want John Bolton and others in the House. They were in too much of a rush. Now they want them all in the Senate. Not supposed to be that way!
1219284434635100162 2020-01-20 07:43:57 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrat Party in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia are working hard to take away your 2nd Amendment rights. This is just the beginning. Don’t let it happen, VOTE REPUBLICAN in 2020!
1219076533354037249 2020-01-19 17:57:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great show! Check it out tonight at 9pm. @FoxNews
1219066007731310593 2020-01-19 17:16:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “In the House, the President got less due process than the 9-11 terrorists got. This is a corrupt process?” Mark Levin @marklevinshow “Very much so!” @RepDougCollins @FoxNews
1219053709428248576 2020-01-19 16:27:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I was thrilled to be back in the Great State of Texas tonight, where the people are known for being tough, strong, hardworking, loyal and fiercely patriotic — just like America’s incredible Farmers! #AFBF2020  https://t.co/JKkiPxPL0X
1219004689716412416 2020-01-19 13:12:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Now Mini Mike Bloomberg is critical of Jack Wilson, who saved perhaps hundreds of people in a Church because he was carrying a gun, and knew how to use it. Jack quickly killed the shooter, who was beginning a rampage. Mini is against the 2nd A. His ads are Fake, just like him!
1218962544372670467 2020-01-19 10:24:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I have never seen the Republican Party as Strong and as Unified as it is right now. Thank you!
1218952496388956162 2020-01-19 09:44:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I will be going to Austin, Texas. Leaving soon. Always like (love!) being in the Lone Star State. Speaking to our great Farmers. They hit “paydirt” with our incredible new Trade Deals: CHINA, JAPAN, MEXICO, CANADA, SOUTH KOREA, and many others!

1218717833552711680 2020-01-18 18:12:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Nancy Pelosi said, it’s not a question of proof, it’s a question of allegations! Oh really?”  @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews  What a disgrace this Impeachment Scam is for our great Country!
1218697758728769536 2020-01-18 16:52:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> If you listened to the flawed advice of @paulkrugman at the @nytimes, a newspaper that was going broke until I came along, you would have entirely missed the RECORD BREAKING Stock Market (and other) numbers produced since Election Day, 2016. Sorry, those are the FACTS.....
1218697697512820736 2020-01-18 16:52:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....BUT THE BEST IS YET TO COME!
1218674016942219265 2020-01-18 15:18:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A massive 200 Billion Dollar Sea Wall, built around New York to protect it from rare storms, is a costly, foolish &amp; environmentally unfriendly idea that, when needed, probably won’t work anyway. It will also look terrible. Sorry, you’ll just have to get your mops &amp; buckets ready!
1218673508911403008 2020-01-18 15:16:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Another Fake Book by two third rate Washington Post reporters, has already proven to be inaccurately reported, to their great embarrassment, all for the purpose of demeaning and belittling a President who is getting great things done for our Country, at a record clip. Thank you!
1218668999086694400 2020-01-18 14:58:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They are taking the Democrat Nomination away from Crazy Bernie, just like last time. Some things never change!
1218668469597675520 2020-01-18 14:56:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> 95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, A Record. Thank You!

By the way, this didn’t just happen by accident, it’s the result of a lot of the policies that Donald Trump has put into place. Obviously, the Tax Cut, and now we have these two BIG trade deals.” @StephenMoore  Great future growth!

1218309736594116608 2020-01-17 15:10:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> مردم نجیب ایران، که آمریکا را دوست می دارند، سزاوار دولتی هستند که بیش از تمرکز بر کشتن آنها به جرم احترام خواهی، به آنها کمک کند تا به رؤیاهایشان دست یابند. رهبران ایران به جای آن که ایران را به سمت ویرانی بکشانند، باید هراس افکنی را کنار بنهند و ایران را دوباره باعظمت کنند!
1218309612304248834 2020-01-17 15:10:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The noble people of Iran—who love America—deserve a government that's more interested in helping them achieve their dreams than killing them for demanding respect. Instead of leading Iran toward ruin, its leaders should abandon terror and Make Iran Great Again!
1218297466656829440 2020-01-17 14:22:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The so-called “Supreme Leader” of Iran, who has not been so Supreme lately, had some nasty things to say about the United States and Europe. Their economy is crashing, and their people are suffering. He should be very careful with his words!
1218297464941314049 2020-01-17 14:22:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Your 2nd Amendment is under very serious attack in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia. That’s what happens when you vote for Democrats, they will take your guns away. Republicans will win Virginia in 2020. Thank you Dems!
1218297460185030658 2020-01-17 14:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Words of wisdom. Thank you Ted!
1218264289225728000 2020-01-17 12:10:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Heading to Florida for big Republican Party event. New Stock Market Record. Jobs in USA at all-time high!
1218195035646242820 2020-01-17 07:35:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....Joe Biden, and Bernie is shut out again. Very unfair, but that’s the way the Democrats play the game. Anyway, it’s a lot of fun to watch!
1218195021930926082 2020-01-17 07:35:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They are rigging the election again against Bernie Sanders, just like last time, only even more obviously. They are bringing him out of so important Iowa in order that, as a Senator, he sit through the Impeachment Hoax Trial. Crazy Nancy thereby gives the strong edge to Sleepy...
1218190672064319488 2020-01-17 07:17:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Getting ready to meet the LSU Tigers, the National Champions. Great Coach, great Team, great School. Very exciting!
1218174158280019968 2020-01-17 06:12:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mini Mike Bloomberg ads are purposely wrong - A vanity project for him to get into the game. Nobody in many years has done for the USA what I have done for the USA, including the greatest economy in history, rebuilding our military, biggest ever tax &amp; regulation cuts, &amp; 2nd A!
1218165916451602432 2020-01-17 05:39:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mini Mike Bloomberg doesn’t get on the Democrat Debate Stage because he doesn’t want to - he is a terrible debater and speaker. If he did, he would go down in the polls even more (if that is possible!).
1218164681464000513 2020-01-17 05:34:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “There is no crime here. Entertaining this Impeachment is a joke. This whole thing should be dismissed.” @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews

The law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities to those Congress has enacted into law. It’s exactly the opposite.

1217836310657892353 2020-01-16 07:49:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is a total disgrace, but just another reason that I’m going to win Michigan again!
1217829723222478848 2020-01-16 07:23:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Looking at this strongly!
1217827468230434818 2020-01-16 07:14:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The farmers are really happy with the new China Trade Deal and the soon to be signed deal with Mexico and Canada, but I hope the thing they will most remember is the fact that I was able to take massive incoming Tariff money and use it to help them get through the tough times!
1217825047102066688 2020-01-16 07:04:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “There is no crime here. I just think this whole thing should be rejected out of hand. I wouldn’t waste a minute of taxpayer dollars or time on this. Entertaining this Impeachment is a joke.” Laura Ingraham @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews
1217808535091916800 2020-01-16 05:59:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Cryin’ Chuck Schumer is saying privately that the new China Trade Deal is  unbelievable, which it is, but publicly he knocks it whenever possible. That’s politics, but so bad for our great Country!
1217804029599920128 2020-01-16 05:41:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> One of the greatest trade deals ever made! Also good for China and our long term relationship. 250 Billion Dollars will be coming back to our Country, and we are now in a great position for a Phase Two start. There has never been anything like this in U.S. history! USMCA NEXT!

1217469828656701442 2020-01-15 07:33:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Here we go again, another Con Job by the Do Nothing Democrats. All of this work was supposed to be done by the House, not the Senate!
1217329023182872576 2020-01-14 22:13:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I agree with him on this, 100%. But why would anyone vote Democrat? We are setting all time records with the economy!
1217321896808722432 2020-01-14 21:45:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Now up to 187 Federal Judges, and two great new Supreme Court Justices. We are in major record territory. Hope EVERYONE is happy!

1217303398636126210 2020-01-14 20:32:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, @BorisJohnson, stated, “We should replace the Iran deal with the Trump deal.” I agree!

1217231373011865600 2020-01-14 15:45:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Cryin’ Chuck Schumer just said, “The American people want a fair trial in the Senate.” True, but why didn’t Nervous Nancy and Corrupt politician Adam “Shifty” Schiff give us a fair trial in the House. It was the most lopsided &amp; unfair basement hearing in the history of Congress!

1216961142867681280 2020-01-13 21:52:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you!
1216954477783048193 2020-01-13 21:25:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you to Rick Scott. This Impeachment Hoax is an outrage!
1216872069591289858 2020-01-13 15:58:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I stand stronger than anyone in protecting your Healthcare with Pre-Existing Conditions. I am honored to have terminated the very unfair, costly and unpopular individual mandate for you!
1216774903036334080 2020-01-13 09:31:58 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “We demand fairness” shouts Pelosi and the Do Nothing Democrats, yet the Dems in the House wouldn’t let us have 1 witness, no lawyers or even ask questions. It was the most unfair witch-hunt in the history of Congress!
1216755243712643073 2020-01-13 08:13:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Really Big Breaking News (Kidding): Booker, who was in zero polling territory, just dropped out of the Democrat Presidential Primary Race. Now I can rest easy tonight. I was sooo concerned that I would someday have to go head to head with him!
1216754098382524422 2020-01-13 08:09:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media and their Democrat Partners are working hard to determine whether or not the future attack by terrorist Soleimani was “imminent” or not, &amp; was my team in agreement. The answer to both is a strong YES., but it doesn’t really matter because of his horrible past!
1216750167954804736 2020-01-13 07:53:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! The wonderful Iranian protesters refused to step on, or in any way denigrate, our Great American Flag. It was put on the street in order for them to trample it, and they walked around it instead. Big progress!
1216748556561866755 2020-01-13 07:47:16 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Democrats and the Fake News are trying to make terrorist Soleimani into a wonderful guy, only because I did what should have been done for 20 years. Anything I do, whether it’s the economy, military, or anything else, will be scorned by the Rafical Left, Do Nothing Democrats!
1216743062543663105 2020-01-13 07:25:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Bernie Sander’s volunteers are trashing Elizabeth “Pocahontus” Warren. Everybody knows her campaign is dead and want her potential voters. Mini Mike B is also trying, but getting tiny crowds which are all leaving fast. Elizabeth is very angry at Bernie. Do I see a feud brewing?
1216716358676860928 2020-01-13 05:39:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....and, if Republicans win in court and take back the House of Represenatives, your healthcare, that I have now brought to the best place in many years, will become the best ever, by far. I will always protect your Pre-Existing Conditions, the Dems will not!
1216716337822695425 2020-01-13 05:39:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Mini Mike Bloomberg is spending a lot of money on False Advertising. I was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your Healthcare, you have it now, while at the same time winning the fight to rid you of the expensive, unfair and very unpopular Individual  Mandate.....
1216540493821239296 2020-01-12 18:00:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> مشاور امنیت ملی امروز عنوان کرد كه تحریم ها و اعتراضات، ایران را«به شدت تحت فشار»قرار داده است و آنها را مجبور به مذاكره می كند.در واقع، اصلا برایم اهمیتی نداردکه آیا آنها مذاکره می کنند یا نه.این کاملاً به عهده ی خودشان است، اما سلاح هسته ای نداشته باشیدو«معترضان خود را نکشید.»
1216506722153639942 2020-01-12 15:46:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> National Security Adviser suggested today that sanctions &amp; protests have Iran “choked off”, will force them to negotiate. Actually, I couldn’t care less if they negotiate. Will be totally up to them but, no nuclear weapons and “don’t kill your protesters.”
1216448547777908737 2020-01-12 11:55:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence, no crime, read the transcripts, “no pressure”  Impeachment Hoax, rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have. I agree!

1216435180220620807 2020-01-12 11:02:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Crazy Bernie Sanders is surging in the polls, looking very good against his opponents in the Do Nothing Party. So what does this all mean? Stay tuned!
1216429943925723139 2020-01-12 10:41:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> You can’t make this up!  David Kris, a highly controversial former DOJ official, was just appointed by the FISA Court to oversee reforms to the FBI’s surveillance procedures. Zero credibility. THE SWAMP! @DevinNunes  @MariaBartiromo @FoxNews

1216400564071936001 2020-01-12 08:44:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> خطاب به رهبران ايران: معترضان خود را نكشيد. هزاران تن تاكنون به دست شما كشته يا زنداني شده اند، و جهان نظاره گر است. مهمتر از ان، ايالات متحده نظاره گر است. اينترنت را دوباره وصل كنيد و به خبرنگاران اجازه دهيد ازادانه حركت كنند! كشتار مردم بزرگ ايران را متوقف كنيد!
1216399515948867588 2020-01-12 08:40:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why should I have the stigma of Impeachment attached to my name when I did NOTHING wrong? Read the Transcripts! A totally partisan Hoax, never happened before. House Republicans voted 195-0, with three Dems voting with the Republicans. Very unfair to tens of millions of voters!
1216392879213555714 2020-01-12 08:13:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why did Nervous Nancy allow corrupt politician Shifty Schiff to lie before Congress? He must be a Witness, and so should she!
1216381908717854720 2020-01-12 07:30:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great idea. This phony Impeachment Hoax should not even be allowed to proceed. Did NOTHING wrong. Just a partisan vote. Zero Republicans. Never happened before!
1216380599457452034 2020-01-12 07:25:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “Pelosi has made a mockery of Impeachment. Her Articles are so weak. But more importantly, she thought she could extort the Senate. She couldn’t.” @GreggJarrett @foxandfriends The Do Nothing Democrats are really run by the Radical Left. Too bad!
1216365931804479488 2020-01-12 06:26:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....discretion, and only as a last resort.” Thank you to the great Michael Goodwin. Could not have said it better myself!

He’s a deal maker &amp; his record is that of someone who uses our military might as a deterrent, unleashes it with....
1216365925701705730 2020-01-12 06:26:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Michael Goodwin, New York Post: “Trump’s peace through strength philosophy is what America needs.

1216360697426337792 2020-01-12 06:06:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Kerry got caught essentially admitting that funds given ridiculously to Iran were used to fund attacks on the USA. Only a complete fool would have given that 150 Billion Dollars Plus to Iran. They then went on a Middle East Rampage! @foxandfriends @PeteHegseth
1216358707510071301 2020-01-12 05:58:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> George @GStephanopoulos, ask Crazy Nancy why she allowed Adam “Shifty” Schiff to totally make up my conversation with the Ukrainian President &amp; read his false words to Congress and the world, as though I said it? He got caught! Ask why hearing was most unfair &amp; biased in history?
1216356280933273600 2020-01-12 05:48:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> To the leaders of Iran - DO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS. Thousands have already been killed or imprisoned by you, and the World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching. Turn your internet back on and let reporters roam free! Stop the killing of your great Iranian people!
1216351262742061056 2020-01-12 05:28:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congratulations to @serenawilliams on another big win. She is a great player and an even greater person. Our members in Virginia (Tennis) will never forget you!
1216347531321446400 2020-01-12 05:13:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congratulations to the Great State of Tennessee. You’ve got yourselves a fantastic football team. Big WIN last night!

1216130169477439488 2020-01-11 14:50:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> دولت ایران باید به گروه‌های حقوق بشر اجازه بدهد حقیقت کنونی اعتراضات در جریان مردم ایران را نظارت کرده و گزارش بدهند. نباید شاهد کشتار دوباره ی معترضان مسالمت آمیز و یا قطع اینترنت باشیم. جهان نظاره گر این اتفاقات است.
1216120362230067202 2020-01-11 14:11:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The government of Iran must allow human rights groups to monitor and report facts from the ground on the ongoing protests by the Iranian people. There can not be another massacre of peaceful protesters, nor an internet shutdown. The world is watching.
1216114167108849665 2020-01-11 13:46:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> به مردم شجاع و رنج کشیده ایران: من از ابتدای دوره ریاست جمهوریم با شما ایستاده‌ام و دولت من همچنان با شما خواهد ایستاد. ما اعتراضات شما را از نزدیک دنبال می کنیم. شجاعت شما الهام بخش است.
1216114135529902081 2020-01-11 13:46:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> To the brave, long-suffering people of Iran: I've stood with you since the beginning of my Presidency, and my Administration will continue to stand with you. We are following your protests closely, and are inspired by your courage.
1216105951905882113 2020-01-11 13:13:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The powerful Trump Wall is replacing porous, useless and ineffective barriers in the high traffic areas requested by Border Patrol.

1216005816710500352 2020-01-11 06:35:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> 95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, a record. 53% Approval Rating overall (can we add 7 to 10 percent because of the Trump “thing?”). Thank you!
1216004241418047488 2020-01-11 06:29:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Now the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, are asking @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell to do the job that they were unable to do. They proved NOTHING but my total innocence in the House, despite the most unfair &amp; biased hearings in the history of Congress. Now they demand fairness!
1216001273725685761 2020-01-11 06:17:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Nancy Pelosi will go down as the absolute worst Speaker of the House in U.S. history!
1216000651475460099 2020-01-11 06:15:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> New polling shows that the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax is going nowhere. A vast majority want the Do Nothing Democrats to move on to other things now!
1215998705557475328 2020-01-11 06:07:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Where have the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats gone when they have spent the last 3 days defending the life of Qassem Soleimani, one of the worst terrorists in history and the father of the roadside bomb? He was also looking to do big future damage! Dems are “unhinged.”
1215991304448020480 2020-01-11 05:38:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “FBI Director apologizes for FISA Errors (of which there were far to many to be a coincidence!).” @FoxNews Chris, what about all of the lives that were ruined because of the so-called “errors?” Are these “dirty cops” going to pay a big price for the fraud they committed?
1215778392697720832 2020-01-10 15:32:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Will be interviewed tonight by Laura @IngrahamAngle at 10pmE on @FoxNews. Enjoy!
1215658960461746177 2020-01-10 07:37:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> She will go down as perhaps the least successful Speaker in U.S. History!
1215657414005002240 2020-01-10 07:31:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I love constantly proving them wrong. It’s easy!
1215652460573925377 2020-01-10 07:11:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “I’ve been doing this for 40 years and I’ve never seen anything like this (Economy).” @Varneyco @foxandfriends
1215651567782780930 2020-01-10 07:08:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “11,000 points gained in the Dow in the 3 years since the Election of President Trump. Today it may hit 29,000. That has NEVER happened before in that time frame. That has added 12.8 Trillion Dollars to the VALUE of American Business.” @Varneyco @FoxNews  The best is yet to come!
1215629289988788224 2020-01-10 05:39:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will get this done for our great Miners!

1215457108327571458 2020-01-09 18:15:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican Party is the party of the American Worker, the American Family, and the American Dream! #KAG2020  https://t.co/05XRX2odxN
1215455064183230465 2020-01-09 18:07:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> After years of rebuilding OTHER nations, we are finally rebuilding OUR nation. We are finally putting AMERICA FIRST! #KAG2020  https://t.co/azKL54A6BU
1215454244519718912 2020-01-09 18:04:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Under my administration, we will NEVER make excuses for America’s enemies – we will never hesitate in defending American lives – and we will never stop working to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism!  https://t.co/022PjwhHjs

1215401433824026624 2020-01-09 14:34:17 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Smart analysis, I fully agree!
1215395413630451712 2020-01-09 14:10:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you!
1215332241523585024 2020-01-09 09:59:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Happy National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day! #LESM  https://t.co/kNN3RetVvs
1215299143066947584 2020-01-09 07:47:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> STOCK MARKET AT ALL-TIME HIGH! HOW ARE YOUR 401K’S DOING? 70%, 80%, 90% up? Only 50% up! What are you doing wrong?
1215287261606051844 2020-01-09 07:00:36 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> U.S. Cancer Death Rate Lowest In Recorded History! A lot of good news coming out of this Administration.
1215268595707543552 2020-01-09 05:46:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Breaking News: The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals just reversed a lower court decision &amp; gave us the go ahead to build one of the largest sections of the desperately needed Southern Border Wall, Four Billion Dollars. Entire Wall is under construction or getting ready to start!
1215262141634306048 2020-01-09 05:20:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hope that all House Republicans will vote against Crazy Nancy Pelosi’s War Powers Resolution. Also, remember her “speed &amp; rush” in getting the Impeachment Hoax voted on &amp; done. Well, she never sent the Articles to the Senate. Just another Democrat fraud. Presidential Harassment!
1215249474043482113 2020-01-09 04:30:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
1215247278631530496 2020-01-09 04:21:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Pelosi doesn’t want to hand over The Articles of Impeachment, which were fraudulently produced by corrupt politicians like Shifty Schiff in the first place, because after all of these years of investigations and persecution, they show no crimes and are a joke and a scam!
1215241520804253698 2020-01-09 03:58:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great!
1215239172195278848 2020-01-09 03:49:31 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> WINRED!
1215238707848060928 2020-01-09 03:47:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> See you later!
1214739853025394693 2020-01-07 18:45:24 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All is well! Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq. Assessment of casualties &amp; damages taking place now. So far, so good! We have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world, by far! I will be making a statement tomorrow morning.
1214624074724466689 2020-01-07 11:05:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Had a very good meeting with @kbsalsaud of Saudi Arabia. We discussed Trade, Military, Oil Prices, Security, and Stability in the Middle East!
1214538977866334209 2020-01-07 05:27:12 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great interview with @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy on @foxandfriends. “There was no urgency with the Articles of Impeachment because there was no case.”
1214513143021527046 2020-01-07 03:44:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We love Australia!
1214345971947180032 2020-01-06 16:40:15 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Amazing analysis &amp; reporting!
1214333364997697536 2020-01-06 15:50:10 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....If however, the city or state in question is willing to acknowledge responsibility, and politely asks for help from the Federal Government, we will very seriously consider getting involved in order to make those poorly run Democrat Cities Great Again!
1214333364204974082 2020-01-06 15:50:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The homeless situation in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and many other Democrat Party run cities throughout the Nation is a state and local problem, not a federal problem....

1214197038063243266 2020-01-06 06:48:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> IRAN WILL NEVER HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!
1214194843246829569 2020-01-06 06:39:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congress &amp; the President should not be wasting their time and energy on a continuation of the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax when we have so many important matters pending. 196 to ZERO was the Republican House vote, &amp; we got 3 Dems. This was not what the Founders had in mind!
1214193106423369728 2020-01-06 06:32:49 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Impeachment Hoax, just a continuation of the Witch Hunt which started even before I won the Election, must end quickly. Read the Transcripts, see the Ukrainian President’s strong statement, NO PRESSURE - get this done. It is a con game by the Dems to help with the Election!
1214179198056697856 2020-01-06 05:37:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The reason they are not sending the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is that they are so weak and so pathetic.” @LindseyGrahamSC @MariaBartiromo  The great Scam continues. To be spending time on this political Hoax at this moment in our history, when I am so busy, is sad!
1213919480574812160 2020-01-05 12:25:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> These Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target, the United States will quickly &amp; fully strike back, &amp; perhaps in a disproportionate manner. Such legal notice is not required, but is given nevertheless!
1213689342272659456 2020-01-04 21:11:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The United States just spent Two Trillion Dollars on Military Equipment. We are the biggest and by far the BEST in the World! If Iran attacks an American Base, or any American, we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way...and without hesitation!
1213684819537932293 2020-01-04 20:53:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They attacked us, &amp; we hit back. If they attack again, which I would strongly advise them not to do, we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before!

The USA wants no more threats!

1213593965838163968 2020-01-04 14:52:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an American, &amp; badly wounded many others, not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime, including recently....
1213585005986959361 2020-01-04 14:16:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> As hard as I work, &amp; as successful as our Country has become with our Economy, our Military &amp; everything else, it is ashame that the Democrats make us spend so much time &amp; money on this ridiculous Impeachment Lite Hoax. I should be able to devote all of my time to the REAL USA!

1213115183507398656 2020-01-03 07:09:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The United States has paid Iraq Billions of Dollars a year, for many years. That is on top of all else we have done for them. The people of Iraq don’t want to be dominated &amp; controlled by Iran, but ultimately, that is their choice. Over the last 15 years, Iran has gained more....
