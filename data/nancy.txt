1327393723190218752 2020-11-13 15:31:40 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Every veteran lost to suicide is a tragedy that tears at the heart of our nation. I salute @RepMarkTakano for his leadership on the bipartisan COMPACT Act which will combat the veteran suicide crisis &amp; honor Lincoln's immortal pledge to care for those who have “borne the battle."  https://t.co/TwMzLMoWIF
1327325507394953217 2020-11-13 11:00:36 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Thank you @RepMarkTakano &amp; @VetAffairsDems for their work to curb veteran suicide and securing passage of Veterans’ COMPACT Act, which is headed to the President’s desk. Just as the military leaves no one behind on the battlefield, we leave no veteran behind when they come home.  https://t.co/HOQZuwzm9n

1326660862183174144 2020-11-11 14:59:32 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, #VeteransDay, I had the privilege of visiting the WWII Memorial to honor the courage &amp; sacrifice of the heroes who serve our nation in uniform. Our veterans deserve more than our gratitude. We must build a future worthy of their sacrifice &amp; that of their families.  https://t.co/aaMIBwDcM5

1326248615749296128 2020-11-10 11:41:25 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Democrats believe this lawsuit has no merit, and we will continue to fight to make coverage more affordable and accessible for all Americans. #SaveTheACA  Read my full statement with @SenSchumer here:  https://t.co/ZhZErjBs5h
1326248614562291717 2020-11-10 11:41:24 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> If the Trump-GOP lawsuit is successful, more than 20 million Americans could lose their health care coverage, 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions could lose protections, and drug costs could skyrocket for seniors.
1326248613756985344 2020-11-10 11:41:24 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Republicans have tried and failed to repeal the ACA at least 70 times in Congress and twice through the courts, but as was heard in today’s oral arguments, the Supreme Court must be deferential to Congress’s intent and uphold the law.
1326192336955641856 2020-11-10 07:57:47 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> More than 130 million Americans live with pre-existing conditions. Today, Republicans’ single-minded effort to tear the ACA’s protections away from these Americans – in the middle of a pandemic – is before the Supreme Court. #SaveTheACA  https://t.co/zY0RZiZ9GO

Until then, we must crush the virus with testing, tracing, treatment, mask wearing &amp; social distancing to save lives.
1325138529693917184 2020-11-07 10:10:20 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> In President-elect Joe Biden, Americans elected a leader ready on Day One.

1321603393585090561 2020-10-28 17:02:57 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The best thing the President can do for our country is to stand up and take the results of this election like a man. #MSNBCLive  https://t.co/FmwoQCqK0Q

1321145870839173123 2020-10-27 10:44:55 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Reliable high-speed internet isn’t a luxury — it is a necessity as communities confront the COVID-19 pandemic. The FCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality is a blow against small businesses and students nationwide. We will not give up the fight to restore the free &amp; open internet.
1321120370750115841 2020-10-27 09:03:36 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> On this solemn anniversary, all Americans must come together to condemn these heinous acts and honor our values of freedom and diversity.  https://t.co/teOjGo9min

1320901997646745602 2020-10-26 18:35:52 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump and Senate Republicans have committed an act of supreme desperation: jamming through a Supreme Court nominee just eight days before Election Day as part of their years-long campaign to destroy Americans’ health care.
1320385681584246786 2020-10-25 08:24:12 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> .@HouseDemocrats are fighting for: -Food for the hungry families -Rent assistance for those facing eviction -Strategic plan to crush the virus  It’s time for Republicans to accept the science and work with us to achieve these and other goals laid out in the #HeroesAct.  https://t.co/uv5dkbqNq8
1319763293712560131 2020-10-23 15:11:03 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Until the GOP can agree that science and governance are the key to crushing the virus, the pandemic will continue to destroy the lives and livelihoods of the American people. #MSNBCLive  https://t.co/YCz4jqL0aP

1318231956694454274 2020-10-19 09:46:04 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> For decades, SNAP has been a lifeline in the fight against hunger and a proven pathway out of poverty for millions. The Courts are clear: the Trump Admin’s rule stealing food off the table of over one million struggling Americans is contrary to the law.  https://t.co/iTUasPmkmm
1317891706495373312 2020-10-18 11:14:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Trump Administration must negotiate in good faith. They told us they would put a light touch on our most recent proposal for testing &amp; tracing. Instead, they took a chainsaw to the proposal, cutting more than half of our proposal. #ThisWeek  https://t.co/UFpsfb5SP2

1310390582561443847 2020-09-27 18:27:15 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> It is a sign of President Trump’s disdain for America’s working families that he has spent years abusing the tax code while passing a GOP Tax Scam for the rich that gives 83 percent of the benefits to the wealthiest 1 percent.  https://t.co/FXfxlc7wfY

1309979552358248448 2020-09-26 15:13:58 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> For four years, President Trump has tried to crush the Affordable Care Act. With his Supreme Court nominee, he is threatening the destruction of every benefit and protection of the ACA, including life-saving protections for 135 million Americans with pre-existing conditions.
1309607436454682624 2020-09-25 14:35:18 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, we gathered to honor the legacy of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice’s Ginsburg’s towering intellect, tenacity and devotion to our nation’s founding ideals of equality and justice inspired millions around the world. Now, we must continue her work.  https://t.co/ajXjQM9a5w
1309536323632533504 2020-09-25 09:52:44 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Members of the House &amp; Senate are coming together on the steps of the U.S. Capitol as we say goodbye to Justice Ginsburg for the last time.  https://t.co/DVbCePSpix
1309493708778360832 2020-09-25 07:03:24 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Justice Ginsburg embodied justice, brilliance &amp; goodness. Her passing is an incalculable loss for our democracy and for all who strive to build a better future for our children. Today, she lies in state in the U.S. Capitol as we honor her legacy.  https://t.co/07aljfSQXN
1309292976947056641 2020-09-24 17:45:45 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump’s bogus executive order on pre-existing conditions isn’t worth the paper it’s signed on.  https://t.co/ZdKgK6xo2p
1309255774699499521 2020-09-24 15:17:56 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> .@RepDerekKilmer and the @ModernizeCmte continue to lead the way on making Congress work better #ForThePeople through bipartisan solutions to modernize the Congress.
1309197941274546176 2020-09-24 11:28:07 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Together, we mourn the more than 200,000 men, women and children who we have lost to this virus. We owe it to their families and friends to do all we can to defeat this virus and support the heroes who are fighting to save lives today and in the weeks to come.  https://t.co/LdFz3D30ha

1308892845265256458 2020-09-23 15:15:47 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> That’s why the House passed the George Floyd #JusticeInPolicing Act this summer. We owe it to Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Philando Castile and so many others to finally bring an end to police brutality.
1308892844363599872 2020-09-23 15:15:46 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Breonna Taylor should be alive today. She should be living and laughing and loving. Instead, her family is left continuing the search for justice. Today's charging decision holds no one accountable for her death.
1308845450393460736 2020-09-23 12:07:27 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump has trampled on American democracy.    But House Democrats will protect and strengthen it for generations to come.   The #ProtectingOurDemocracy Act will prevent presidential abuses, restore our system of checks &amp; balances and protect our elections.  https://t.co/57bDbtiqPY
1308754784674033664 2020-09-23 06:07:10 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, @HouseDemocrats are taking action to preserve American democracy for future generations as we introduce the #ProtectingOurDemocracy Act.  https://t.co/NOURVf4MfD

1308517317945552897 2020-09-22 14:23:34 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump wants politics to determine how we approach fighting this virus. That is sinful. #inners  https://t.co/39tjd09DZA
1308485769397497856 2020-09-22 12:18:12 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump &amp; Mitch McConnell are rushing to vote on the next Supreme Court Justice so they can tear the protections provided by the Affordable Care Act away from millions of Americans. #inners  https://t.co/qGpZqqwkmh
1308480235088867328 2020-09-22 11:56:13 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We continue to pray for the families who have lost loved ones &amp; those whose ongoing health has been jeopardized by the coronavirus.  https://t.co/DcTRL0cyuU
1308480234057084928 2020-09-22 11:56:12 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump’s contempt for science, governance &amp; the American people’s health has led to an historic national tragedy. Republicans must accept the gravity of this crisis &amp; vote on the science-based strategy in the #HeroesAct, which passed the House more than four months ago.
1308480233104965633 2020-09-22 11:56:12 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> More than 200,000 men, women and children have lost their lives to this coronavirus in the United States.  Our hearts break for them and their loved ones.  The pain is made worse by the simple fact that it didn’t have to be this way.
1308162109319139329 2020-09-21 14:52:05 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Read my full statement here:  https://t.co/I8tekH9IvQ
1308162108014710785 2020-09-21 14:52:05 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Nearly 200,000 Americans have died. Almost seven million Americans have been infected. The sudden removal of CDC guidelines on airborne coronavirus spread is the latest sign of the Trump Admin’s broken response to this crisis, which continues to cost American lives.
1307780263410388994 2020-09-20 13:34:46 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump and his henchmen have threatened to not accept the results of the November election. We have a responsibility to do all we can to protect the integrity of our democracy. #ThisWeek  https://t.co/oIosGCb6Yo
1307752520320720901 2020-09-20 11:44:32 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The outpouring of love &amp; support we have seen in honor of Ruth Bader Ginsburg is only fitting as we reflect on the life of this truly remarkable person. #ThisWeek  https://t.co/DQKnUPpqiH
1307724175763742721 2020-09-20 09:51:54 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Three years after Hurricane Maria ravaged communities in Puerto Rico &amp; the U.S. Virgin Islands, we continue to hold all those impacted in our hearts. We remain committed to ensuring our fellow Americans have the resources they need to build back stronger than ever.  https://t.co/uuRKhPG9cE
1307711191180095489 2020-09-20 09:00:18 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg may have been petite in size, but the impact she left on America was immense. May her memory be a blessing and inspire each of us to work toward a more equal, more just future for all.  https://t.co/tNZ7jsfwHJ
1307311897742651393 2020-09-19 06:33:39 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> As America approaches 200,000 lives lost to the coronavirus, it is clearer than ever that we must enact the #HeroesAct. Thanks to leaders like @RepDMP, we will ensure America has a science-based strategy for defeating this pandemic.  https://t.co/2SHRN6ncOu

1307132462313738240 2020-09-18 18:40:39 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We must honor Justice Ginsburg’s trailblazing career and safeguard her powerful legacy by ensuring that the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court upholds her commitment to equality, opportunity and justice for all.
1307132458924740608 2020-09-18 18:40:38 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Ruth Bader Ginsburg embodied justice, brilliance and goodness. Her passing is an incalculable loss for our democracy and for all who sacrifice and strive to build a better future for our children.  https://t.co/BufY4jXPR8
1307122723554983936 2020-09-18 18:01:57 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Tonight, the flags are flying at half staff over the Capitol to honor the patriotism of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Every woman and girl, and therefore every family, in America has benefitted from her brilliance.
1307087600411381762 2020-09-18 15:42:23 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> At this time of celebration and introspection, let us come together in hope that this #RoshHashanah brings a year of good health and prosperity for the Jewish community, for America and for the world.  https://t.co/GJ40B7JxE2  https://t.co/xFnVwnCaBa

We must #FundTheFrontLines.  https://t.co/tmsfu1a8dD

1306307001966891009 2020-09-16 12:00:33 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> America continues to hold Army Specialist Vanessa Guillen's family in our hearts.

1306297636425797632 2020-09-16 11:23:21 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Americans’ lives &amp; livelihoods depend on Republicans abandoning their obsession with doing as little as possible while the coronavirus rages through our nation.  Read my full statement with @SenSchumer:  https://t.co/gqzvU4FHOL
1306297635603714052 2020-09-16 11:23:20 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> It's encouraging to see that the President is now calling on Republicans to “go for the much higher numbers” after months of Senate GOP efforts to shortchange Americans’ needs. We look forward hearing from his negotiators that they will finally meet us halfway. #FamiliesFirstNow
1306281927742238720 2020-09-16 10:20:55 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Republicans should know this about me by now: I count playing with the safety of our children as fighting words. We have a duty to do our best to protect them from this virus. @Morning_Joe  https://t.co/Y6BnxMYNxb
1305921630745567234 2020-09-15 10:29:14 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Our Latino community has always been a central part of our American story.

1305891810938675202 2020-09-15 08:30:44 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> If true, the appalling conditions described at an ICE detention facility — including allegations of mass hysterectomies performed on immigrant women — are a staggering abuse of human rights. @DHSOIG must immediately investigate these allegations.  https://t.co/Rkr3yLt54r
1305600122009587713 2020-09-14 13:11:40 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Our hearts are with the families of those lost in wildfires on the West Coast, and all who have lost their homes and livelihoods as a result of these disasters.

1305580152685039616 2020-09-14 11:52:19 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The main way we can open our economy &amp; open our schools is to crush the virus. Instead, President Trump is focused on trying to crush the Affordable Care Act at the time when we need it most. #MSNBCLive  https://t.co/vjKthimufK
1305323301317865472 2020-09-13 18:51:41 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Four years of President Trump caving to Big Pharma have culminated in this sham.

1304775939226828800 2020-09-12 06:36:40 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> A smart, strategic approach to #COVID19 and the #ClimateCrisis provides the opportunity to get people back to work &amp; school safely, and recover from today’s economic crisis while laying a foundation for a resilient, equitable economy that lifts all communities. #G7Parliament  https://t.co/976nYyvhvg
1304769424428326913 2020-09-12 06:10:46 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The climate crisis impacts every community — but it does not do so equally.

1304241317841711105 2020-09-10 19:12:16 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> If you see a train coming, you tell people to get out of the way.   The President saw the virus coming and told the American people it was a hoax. #TheReidOut  https://t.co/s0bvqA8tEv
1304233791397994504 2020-09-10 18:42:22 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Secretary DeVos’s assault on public schools is a blatant violation of the law, as has been repeatedly found by the Courts. Read our brief filed today in federal court here:  https://t.co/50NSoiNRUi
1304228412148645895 2020-09-10 18:20:59 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The behavior we have witnessed by the President these past 24 hours shows the contempt he has for the lives &amp; livelihoods of the American people. #TheReidOut  https://t.co/y2GoEQ3CO6
1304196492362645509 2020-09-10 16:14:09 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today’s District Court ruling is a resounding victory for the effort to ensure that all people who live in America are counted in the #2020Census, as was intended by our Founders and confirmed by the Congress.  https://t.co/12VJqJotjQ
1304175183545204741 2020-09-10 14:49:28 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Postal Service is a pillar of our democracy. Today, the House took steps to defend this essential service from the Trump Admin’s sabotage campaign by filing briefs in three cases before federal courts. #DontMessWithUSPS  Learn more here:  https://t.co/eHEvVEzsx0
1304136071454904320 2020-09-10 12:14:03 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The White House and Republican Senators need to accept the gravity of the crisis facing American communities and work with Democrats to #FundTheFrontLines. Our state &amp; local heroes need our support so they can keep working to save lives. Pass the #HeroesAct now!
1304074086965039105 2020-09-10 08:07:45 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Tune in as I speak with reporters live from the U.S. Capitol.  https://t.co/KN6LtEZjDP

1303830524738363398 2020-09-09 15:59:55 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President’s own words spell out the devastating truth: Trump was fully aware of the catastrophic nature of the coronavirus but hid the facts and refused to take the threat seriously, leaving our entire country exposed and unprepared. #TrumpKnew  https://t.co/WSq1jbL188  https://t.co/YjYiRaC8Qy
1303815868011380744 2020-09-09 15:01:41 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Good Friday Agreement is the bedrock of peace in Northern Ireland.  If the U.K. violates its international agreements &amp; Brexit undermines the Good Friday accord, there will be absolutely no chance of a U.S.-U.K. trade agreement passing the Congress.   https://t.co/n7E4GHTJcI
1303405586940395521 2020-09-08 11:51:22 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> It’s been 116 days since the House passed the Heroes Act and the Senate GOP are finally waking up to the damage their decision to “take a pause” has caused in communities nationwide. Republicans must stop blocking efforts to pass the policies included in the #HeroesAct into law.  https://t.co/5e4N8bPtM2

1303381198580973569 2020-09-08 10:14:28 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Leader McConnell is finally realizing the damage caused by his one-sided “pause” to America’s coronavirus response. Yet a quick glance at his emaciated bill reveals it is designed to allow vulnerable GOP Senators to “check the box," while failing to put #FamiliesFirst.
1302986862097653760 2020-09-07 08:07:30 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Over generations, working people across America built the middle class and secured progress for hard-working families. House Democrats are unified in our commitment to America’s working families. Happy #LaborDay!  https://t.co/kO7jykYDkm  https://t.co/HsCYyzVNIr
1302662687806156803 2020-09-06 10:39:21 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Leader McConnell may have declared a “pause” to America’s coronavirus response, but it is clear the virus never did the same. It has been 114 days since the #HeroesAct passed the House. Enough waiting. America’s families need action now. #AMJoy  https://t.co/nNXRWWpKFz
1301975117170434055 2020-09-04 13:07:12 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The sad state of America’s coronavirus response today is the result of President Trump’s failure to lead these past months and Mitch McConnell’s one-sided pause. We can’t waste a day. The Senate must pass the #HeroesAct or the situation will worsen.  https://t.co/xlq49ZtDZQ
1301966707829936128 2020-09-04 12:33:47 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Few know more about our education system than @BobbyScott. When he says schools won’t be able to protect students, staff &amp; families w/o significant federal funding, it must be taken seriously. The @SenateGOP must work with us to deliver for communities nationwide. #HeroesAct  https://t.co/hFrRNoim6K
1301954867712397312 2020-09-04 11:46:44 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump’s insulting comments about our men and women in uniform are appalling. Our military deserves a Commander-in-Chief who respects their service. Clearly, Trump does not.  https://t.co/my8NosRXtB  https://t.co/NqHLie2cuQ
1301908602517696513 2020-09-04 08:42:53 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> With millions still unemployed, particularly in communities of color, the #JobsReport is a reminder of the urgent need to enact the #HeroesAct, as the economic recovery stimulated by Congress’s early &amp; robust investments continues to slow down.  https://t.co/s6zFa8dssx
1301897122439192576 2020-09-04 07:57:16 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Trump Admin’s politically motivated efforts to rush the #Census count are a threat to reach an accurate count.

1301595724212318210 2020-09-03 11:59:37 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Just when frontline workers nationwide most need Washington to work for them, Republicans are still refusing to accept the gravity of this crisis. The White House and Republican Senate need to get serious and work with Democrats to #FundTheFrontLines.
1301574716793257984 2020-09-03 10:36:09 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> It has been 111 days since the House passed the #HeroesAct, and still Republicans in the Senate remain determined to block this plan to help America’s working families. Enough is enough. The Senate must put #FamiliesFirst and finally pass the Heroes Act.  https://t.co/VVQgGG4c0w
1301255008239996929 2020-09-02 13:25:44 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We will forever be in debt to these heroic men and valiant women for their service and sacrifice. #WWII75  https://t.co/PVd8TCwOKa

1300948726572298240 2020-09-01 17:08:41 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> From the start, President Trump has denied the facts about how to best fight the coronavirus. Now, he wants Americans to put loyalty to him ahead of the health of their children, parents, and siblings. #DeadlineWH  https://t.co/Ifc0blPrNf
1300937701957472257 2020-09-01 16:24:53 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Make no mistake: the President is trying to confuse the American people and make it less likely that they will turnout to vote. Do not let his tricks keep you from exercising your right to vote. #DeadlineWH  https://t.co/QbTdWfU4xm

1300856515973255169 2020-09-01 11:02:16 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Right now, 40 million Americans are at risk of eviction. Through no fault of their own, they can't make rent payments. And yet, more than 100 days after the House passed the #HeroesAct, Republicans still refuse to deliver critically needed rental assistance. #FamiliesFirst
1300816912868347904 2020-09-01 08:24:54 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Republicans have made it clear: they do not understand the gravity of the situation facing America’s working families. The #HeroesAct includes the solutions we need to get a handle on this crisis. #inners  https://t.co/OUMtGO8vgX
1300528870341464065 2020-08-31 13:20:20 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump’s actions prove that he still does not grasp the gravity of the coronavirus crisis, even as America passes the tragic milestone of more than 6 million COVID-19 cases nationwide. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/cFFaTp4wbY  https://t.co/73X8ZHQoNF
1300525080020168710 2020-08-31 13:05:16 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today’s unprecedented ruling by a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals panel is a challenge to our system of checks &amp; balances, and is at odds with Supreme Court precedent. The House will immediately pursue an en banc rehearing of this decision.  https://t.co/oNqII9mYPx
1300215911840919555 2020-08-30 16:36:44 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> .@SteveScalise tried to steal @AdyBarkan’s health care with more than 60 votes to repeal or undermine Americans’ health care.   Now, he’s trying to steal Ady’s words by lying.  Congressman Scalise must take his doctored video down and apologize immediately.
1299789344992096256 2020-08-29 12:21:43 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The American people have both the right and the need to know that another nation, Russia, is trying to help decide who their president should be.  Read my statement with @RepAdamSchiff:  https://t.co/9CNkx5oKOs
1299789344006430721 2020-08-29 12:21:43 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Office of the Director of National Intelligence’s decision to cancel all election security briefings for the Congress is a shocking abdication of its responsibility to keep Congress informed.
1299376484663128064 2020-08-28 09:01:09 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> As Americans across the country come together for the #VirtualMarchOnWashington, we give thanks for the generations of leaders who came before, and for all who are continuing the work to secure change today.  https://t.co/IKhMYFeXAf
1299169256937058305 2020-08-27 19:17:42 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump’s fear tactics have one goal: to convince Americans not to exercise their right to vote. Do not listen to him. Do not let him succeed. @thebeatwithari #DontMessWithUSPS  https://t.co/L7R4HRwMjC
1299070400375271424 2020-08-27 12:44:53 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> A short time ago, I spoke with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.

1298426801530843136 2020-08-25 18:07:27 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, we remember two extraordinary patriots who left us on August 25th: Ted Kennedy and John McCain, the bipartisan lions of the Senate.  May their patriotism, greatness and fighting spirits move us to carry on their mission to build a more perfect union.
1298359962863898624 2020-08-25 13:41:52 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> This is Day 102 of Leader McConnell’s blockade of the #HeroesAct.  In that time, 4.3 million Americans have been diagnosed with COVID-19 — and 90,000 more lives have been lost in communities nationwide.

1298249355196092421 2020-08-25 06:22:21 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> It’s official: if President Trump gets his way, the sacred promise of #SocialSecurity will be shattered by mid-2023.  Democrats will stand strong for America’s seniors and Social Security beneficiaries.
1298028013431525383 2020-08-24 15:42:49 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Trillions of dollars are being used to bolster the Stock Market. America must take steps to support hardworking families nationwide as well. #FamiliesFirst #MSNBCLive  https://t.co/cKXhYBIhoL

1297958083134656513 2020-08-24 11:04:56 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The prayers of Americans nationwide are with Jacob Blake as he fights for his life following yesterday’s outrageous shooting in Kenosha, WI. We owe it to Jacob, his children, and all Black Americans to bring an end to racial injustice and police brutality.
1297596920643432449 2020-08-23 11:09:48 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Millions of children are hungry. Millions of Americans are facing eviction. Democrats are fighting for real solutions for all Americans.

1297261139563249670 2020-08-22 12:55:32 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The FDA must approve drugs or vaccines based on their safety and effectiveness – NOT political pressure from the White House.

1296148992066232320 2020-08-19 11:16:15 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Democrats remain committed to protecting the @USPS, and will vote this Saturday on @RepMaloney’s Delivering for America Act, providing $25 billion in support of the Postal Service as the USPS Board of Governors recommended, 100 percent appointed by Trump.
1296148990623395842 2020-08-19 11:16:15 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> This, taken with his unwillingness to plan for adequate worker overtime, directly jeopardizes the election and threatens to disenfranchise voters in communities of color, while also slowing delivery of medicines to veterans.  https://t.co/uN0ETY2kSK
1296148989646188546 2020-08-19 11:16:15 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Earlier today, I spoke with Postmaster General DeJoy regarding his alleged pause in operational changes. During our conversation, he admitted he has no intention of replacing the sorting machines, blue mailboxes and other infrastructure that have been removed.
1295872778512498689 2020-08-18 16:58:41 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Postmaster General DeJoy’s announcement today only halts a limited number of his changes, does not reverse damage already done, and alone is not enough to ensure voters will not be disenfranchised by the President this fall. #DontMessWithUSPS #DeadlineWH  https://t.co/YmS4pe12wh

1295731768579022849 2020-08-18 07:38:21 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Wishing a very Happy Birthday to Rosalynn Carter today. Rosalynn, every day you inspire people around the world to work towards a better future for all. Thank you for your work with @RCICaregiving and so much more. #MrsCarterBirthday
1295148340322226178 2020-08-16 17:00:01 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Read my letter to Members here:  https://t.co/FcVJRo2nTm
1295148339315474435 2020-08-16 17:00:01 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The assault by President Trump &amp; his mega-donor Postmaster General Louis DeJoy on the Postal Service threatens lives, livelihood &amp; life of our American democracy. I am calling on the House to return to vote on Chairwoman Maloney’s "Delivering for America Act." #DontMessWithUSPS
1295013100001939457 2020-08-16 08:02:37 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, @SenSchumer, @RepMaloney &amp; @SenGaryPeters join me in an urgent call for Postmaster General DeJoy and @USPS Board of Governors Chair Duncan to testify before the Congress.  https://t.co/U1Jg03vaKd
1295013098932371456 2020-08-16 08:02:37 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Alarmingly, Postmaster General DeJoy has acted as an accomplice in the President’s effort to cheat the election and manipulate the Postal Service to deny eligible voters access to the ballot in pursuit of his own re-election. #DontMessWithUSPS
1294390470970429448 2020-08-14 14:48:31 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> If you or someone you know in San Francisco needs assistance, know that my team is ready and waiting to help. Learn more here:  https://t.co/oZOUhTlP4i
1294390470106324992 2020-08-14 14:48:31 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Wonderful to see 10-year-old Raghad reunited with her family in San Francisco after so many months apart! Glad my staff could escalate her visa case with the State Department.  https://t.co/OZlMUunFg1
1294366113673940994 2020-08-14 13:11:44 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> For 85 years, #SocialSecurity has stood as a fundamental promise that a lifetime of hard work will be met with the dignity of a secure retirement. Democrats are committed to protecting Social Security and ensuring a secure retirement for all Americans.  https://t.co/i3hZA9xEH9
1294338244847575045 2020-08-14 11:20:59 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Read my full statement with @SenSchumer here:  https://t.co/X8zxn8vPEH
1294338244176424960 2020-08-14 11:20:59 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Postal Service is a pillar of American Democracy. President Trump’s assault on @USPS threatens to starve it of the funds that it needs to deliver Americans’ absentee ballots. The President’s actions and even his own words confirm: he needs to cheat to win. #DontMessWithUSPS
1294052343743492097 2020-08-13 16:24:55 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, we mark #BlackWomensEqualPayDay — the day in 2020 when Black women’s pay finally catches up with white men’s for 2019. We all must do our part every single day to shrink this gap. The House passed the #PaycheckFairness Act over a year ago. What’s your excuse, @senategop?
1294018100300578819 2020-08-13 14:08:51 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The differences between Democrats’ plan to combat the coronavirus &amp; the meager proposals presented by the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress could not be more stark. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/ThtsuQOIAX
1293926252458516482 2020-08-13 08:03:53 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> With families nationwide struggling to make ends meet &amp; children going hungry, Republicans are playing politics and refusing to put #FamiliesFirst. It’s time for them to get serious, meet us halfway &amp; come back to the negotiating table.  https://t.co/iE546mMOqp
1293701321233768449 2020-08-12 17:10:05 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> 89 days ago, @HouseDemocrats passed the #HeroesAct – including critical funding to feed children &amp; families struggling to make ends meet. They deserve real solutions – not Leader McConnell’s minuscule proposal. #MSNBCLive  https://t.co/XUFOo4CoWk
1293671548910477312 2020-08-12 15:11:47 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Read my letter with @RepMaloney and 173 other Representatives:  https://t.co/uiXnSMdPUj
1293671547887132677 2020-08-12 15:11:46 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The smooth functioning of the @USPS during the COVID-19 pandemic is a matter of life-or-death, and is critical for protecting lives, livelihoods and the life of our democracy. Postmaster General DeJoy must reverse new policies which accelerate the crisis at the Postal Service.
1293625747513528321 2020-08-12 12:09:47 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Read my full statement with @SenSchumer:  https://t.co/c6QpiNHMDz
1293625746682937344 2020-08-12 12:09:47 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Democrats have compromised. Repeatedly, we have made clear to the Trump Admin that we are willing to come down $1 trillion if they will come up $1 trillion. However, it is clear that the Admin still does not grasp the magnitude of the problems that American families are facing.
1293278364497842183 2020-08-11 13:09:24 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Right now, children in America are going hungry – and yet Republicans refuse to deliver the unemployment insurance &amp; nutrition assistance their families need. Grateful to all who are fasting today &amp; otherwise calling for Republicans to work with Democrats to #SaveThe600!
1293258135210262529 2020-08-11 11:49:01 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Republicans refused to take action to feed hungry children nationwide during this pandemic – but they did make sure to give business a massive tax break for corporate lunches. #TheReidOut  https://t.co/sHLmkP16u8
1292525252338163712 2020-08-09 11:16:48 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> American voters decide American elections. The Intelligence Community must provide the people with the information necessary to understand how Russia is trying to influence the 2020 Elections. #FoxNewsSunday  https://t.co/cKZYPmmbei
1292512330513879040 2020-08-09 10:25:27 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump’s meager executive actions do little for working families. Republicans must come back to the negotiating table, meet us halfway and work toward a compromise that will truly help American workers and families. #FamiliesFirst #FoxNewsSunday  https://t.co/vAvoLnKIoa
1292240170272673792 2020-08-08 16:23:59 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Democrats repeat our call to Republicans to return to the table, meet us halfway and work together to deliver immediate relief to the American people.  Read my full statement with @SenSchumer:  https://t.co/SnYbvFwcZp
1292239478598373382 2020-08-08 16:21:15 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today’s meager announcements show President Trump still does not comprehend the seriousness or the urgency of the health and economic crises facing working families. These policies provide little real help for families.
1291905949188468737 2020-08-07 18:15:55 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> American women fought hard to win the right to vote with the ratification of the 19th Amendment 100 years ago this month. Thankful for @RepLawrence’s leadership in the fight to ensure women nationwide are able to cast their votes in this year’s elections.  https://t.co/BilbWf3rq6
1291828872179310592 2020-08-07 13:09:38 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today’s ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals allowing the House to continue efforts to enforce its subpoena of Don McGahn reaffirms our Constitution’s system of checks &amp; balances.  https://t.co/utxFH2YgJG
1291749049142517767 2020-08-07 07:52:27 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We call upon the White House’s negotiators to join us once again at the negotiating table today to secure a bipartisan agreement to put children, families and workers first. Read my full statement with @SenSchumer here:  https://t.co/W2ErIwXEAi
1291749048328818688 2020-08-07 07:52:27 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We remain committed to continue negotiating and reaching a fair agreement with the Administration, but we will not go along with the meager legislative proposals that fail to address the gravity of the health &amp; economic situation our country faces.
1291749047540355072 2020-08-07 07:52:27 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The latest #JobsReport shows that the economic recovery spurred by the investments Congress has passed is losing steam and more investments are still urgently needed to protect the lives and livelihoods of the American people.
1291513925469704203 2020-08-06 16:18:09 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The dismissal of the House GOP lawsuit against remote voting by proxy is welcome news and hopefully the end of this sad Republican effort to obstruct the House from meeting the needs of the American people during the coronavirus crisis.  https://t.co/r8p49uhzL4
1291487953991151616 2020-08-06 14:34:57 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Now more than ever, our nation deserves a fully functioning Postal Service that is accountable to the American people. Read the letter @SenSchumer and I sent to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy here:  https://t.co/WCTn1nncRY  https://t.co/v8kmYRboIW
1291457331847471111 2020-08-06 12:33:16 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> With voting rights across the country under Republican attack, it is critical that Leader McConnell end his blockade of the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act of 2020 and finally pass this landmark legislation. #RestoreTheVote  https://t.co/qv0JcRYlxD  https://t.co/3QouhnCCtl
1291386986788540419 2020-08-06 07:53:45 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Democrats are committed to putting #FamiliesFirst as our nation fights the coronavirus pandemic. Tune in as @SenSchumer and I speak with reporters live at the U.S. Capitol.  https://t.co/4YC3pNG7bL
1291378588273512450 2020-08-06 07:20:22 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> At 10:45 am ET, @SenSchumer and I will speak with reporters as Democrats continue our work to put #FamiliesFirst in America’s coronavirus response.  https://t.co/zU3Pjl0oUv
1291374742386114561 2020-08-06 07:05:05 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today marks one year since my constituent Brandon Lee was brutally shot in the Philippines, where he was fighting for environmental &amp; indigenous people’s rights. On behalf of Brandon &amp; his family, I urge the Filipino government to thoroughly investigate this disturbing crime.
1290835164944375808 2020-08-04 19:21:00 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We are working to save lives, livelihoods, and the life of our democracy. The Trump Administration must accept the gravity of the situation we face. #FamiliesFirst #PBSNews  https://t.co/OTF2M4ybDe
1290823658768867331 2020-08-04 18:35:17 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> It’s amazing how free &amp; clear Republicans are when they are handing trillions to their rich friends… and how exacting they are when an out-of-work American receives $600. #FamiliesFirst #PBSNews  https://t.co/6lB1Pei0Oa
1290399904309956613 2020-08-03 14:31:26 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> One year after an act of hate in El Paso which claimed 23 lives and left 23 more injured, our hearts remain broken for all affected. We will never back down from our fight against bigotry and to #EndGunViolence. #ElPasoStrong  https://t.co/gYHCS13vez
1290070614091468800 2020-08-02 16:42:57 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> In order to open up our economy &amp; safely send our children back to school, we must contain the virus. #AMJoy  https://t.co/Ctv1UJB7JT
1290020898729275392 2020-08-02 13:25:24 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We must ensure that all Americans who want to vote-by-mail this fall are able to. No one should be forced to choose between their health and their vote. #ThisWeek  https://t.co/r28S1UOZaY
1290001660157321216 2020-08-02 12:08:57 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Republicans always talk about the private sector’s need for certainty. America’s working families deserve the same courtesy. #AMJoy  https://t.co/7fusuKHUrz
1289980813669539840 2020-08-02 10:46:07 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> It is not enough to confront the consequences of this pandemic – any agreement must be designed to empower us to defeat the coronavirus. That is what the House-passed #HeroesAct is designed to do, and what the American people deserve. #ThisWeek  https://t.co/Z1Zuj7PmAz
1289369708668444672 2020-07-31 18:17:48 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> With my signature, @RepWilson’s landmark legislation creating a commission on the social status of Black men and boys nationwide heads to the President’s desk.  https://t.co/w8ff37B087

1288988783950671872 2020-07-30 17:04:09 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> For 55 years, #Medicare &amp; #Medicaid have stood as pillars of health and economic security for millions of seniors and families. @HouseDemocrats remain committed to defending these bedrock promises from Republican attacks for years to come.  https://t.co/vgVD56ubXT  https://t.co/vx2fwC7kaM
1288918743830208512 2020-07-30 12:25:50 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> When John Lewis spoke, people listened. When he led, people followed. He was our mentor, our colleague, but most of all, our friend. May he rest in peace.  https://t.co/6FaERI5pVv
1288847692173475842 2020-07-30 07:43:30 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution states:  “The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.”
1288661150561906688 2020-07-29 19:22:15 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> You need to believe in science and governance in order to bring an end to this pandemic. #AC360  https://t.co/X1oBL8q1GP
1288529348778242052 2020-07-29 10:38:31 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Safely reopening our economy requires making sure Americans have access to quality, affordable child care. Today, the House votes on legislation to #SaveChildCare for families nationwide.  https://t.co/23MTacGJ2r
1288516665047687168 2020-07-29 09:48:07 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> I would hope that over 10 weeks of failing to act, Leader McConnell would at least get his facts straight:  The House-passed #HeroesAct extends the enhanced unemployment benefits families are depending on — while his “proposal” slashes benefits by $400 a week.
1288499435404587008 2020-07-29 08:39:39 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, Members of Congress sadly said goodbye to our friend, Congressman John Lewis, as he left the U.S. Capitol for the last time. Thank you to all who helped give John the beautiful farewell he received over the last two days.  https://t.co/WjdvBDZxfO
1287889090386571264 2020-07-27 16:14:21 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We've bid farewell to some of the greatest Americans in our history under the dome of the U.S. Capitol. Today, Rep. John Lewis, the Conscience of the Congress, joined that pantheon of patriots. John always worked on the side of the angels. Now, we know that he is with them.  https://t.co/uV2iLJvTrX
1287874902796701697 2020-07-27 15:17:59 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Americans need to buy food &amp; pay rent. Republicans shouldn’t be quibbling over $600 for workers on unemployment. #FamiliesFirst #DeadlineWH  https://t.co/qiuxG71XL7
1287810833364508678 2020-07-27 11:03:23 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Congressman John Lewis was the conscience of the Congress. Today, we say goodbye to our friend and colleague, honoring his legacy of advancing freedom and justice for all.  https://t.co/pf697CGr5o
1287794602330796032 2020-07-27 09:58:53 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today and tomorrow, Congressman John Lewis will lie in state in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol.  Watch at 1:30 pm ET as Members of the House and Senate come together for an arrival ceremony honoring our friend and colleague:  https://t.co/rFd2fqW3Qv
1287761874260504577 2020-07-27 07:48:50 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Democrats have stood ready to negotiate for more than two months. I call upon GOP congressional leaders &amp; the President’s team to join Leader Schumer &amp; me within a half an hour of releasing their plan today to negotiate and get the job done.  https://t.co/Savdgh4dmM
1287761873203597312 2020-07-27 07:48:50 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> After 10 weeks of Senate Republicans’ unilateral “pause” on responding to the coronavirus, it remains unclear whether they will release their plan today – even as working families struggle to make rent, children go hungry and unemployment is expiring.
1287518403062894592 2020-07-26 15:41:22 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> House Democrats have been anxious to negotiate since we unveiled the #HeroesAct two months and ten days ago. Republicans’ delays in continuing our nation’s response to this crisis is causing suffering for American families. @FaceTheNation  https://t.co/iF0zY2LXZo
1287487113408249857 2020-07-26 13:37:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Most Americans know we need to extend unemployment insurance for working families impacted by this crisis. Senate Republicans need to stop complicating this issue and extend this lifeline for families nationwide. @FaceTheNation  https://t.co/mBOrXGTLd0
1287459513214410763 2020-07-26 11:47:22 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> For 30 years, the Americans with Disabilities Act has stood as a landmark civil rights victory. In the face of the Trump Admin’s attacks on the ADA, Democrats remain committed to defending &amp; expanding its protections.  https://t.co/Kn1rhiW1Tt  https://t.co/zfTZRwdwJw
1287454612216262656 2020-07-26 11:27:53 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> At every turn, President Trump has made matters worse for our country as we seek to fight the coronavirus. Instead of denying facts and trying to rush our children back to school before it is safe, he should be supporting the policies found in the #HeroesAct. @FaceTheNation  https://t.co/sXSqCpFjje
1287043064226353152 2020-07-25 08:12:33 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Each and every one of us has a duty to stand up to hate wherever it appears. The KZV Armenian School is a part of the beautiful fabric of our San Francisco family. The hateful defacing of this place of community &amp; learning is a disgrace.
1286835530538389505 2020-07-24 18:27:53 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Once again, President Trump has caved to Big Pharma with his empty Executive Orders.  If the President was serious about cutting Rx prices, he would tell Leader McConnell to pass the #LowerDrugCosts Now Act immediately.  https://t.co/ZcLe82ltls
1286761044141015041 2020-07-24 13:31:54 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> I couldn’t agree more with @RepAdamSchiff: if we are to truly honor Congressman John Lewis’s legacy, we must stand up against the President’s efforts to undermine our elections and the right to vote.  https://t.co/w31GALe6TY
1286708438668632064 2020-07-24 10:02:52 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Without action by President Trump &amp; Senate Republicans, federal unemployment insurance will expire for millions of Americans this weekend. The Senate must take up the House-passed #HeroesAct &amp; extend this critical lifeline for working families.  https://t.co/C9ihHVrGeo
1286706005276008455 2020-07-24 09:53:12 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Unemployment insurance is a critical lifeline for millions of working Americans directly impacted by this crisis. Tune in at 1 pm ET as @RepDanKildee, @RepRichardNeal &amp; @RepDannyDavis join me to call on Senate Republicans to pass the #HeroesAct.  https://t.co/2fi357l3G3
1286457391438077953 2020-07-23 17:25:17 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Few have done more to bring the United States closer to that more perfect union than our dear friend, Rep. John Lewis. As he lies in state in the Capitol Rotunda next week, I hope all Americans will take time to reflect on how we can each honor his legacy.  https://t.co/yXFzBAO1tP
1286447704567160832 2020-07-23 16:46:48 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> This President has been practically the biggest failure in American history. The Trump Virus is rolling through the country. Just imagine how many lives could have been saved if the tests he calls “overrated” had been widely available months ago. #TheReidOut

1286118761385385984 2020-07-22 18:59:42 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> To defeat COVID-19, we need to expand testing &amp; ensure people get their results quickly. That will only happen if the President fully employs the Defense Production Act to deliver critically-needed equipment. @MadMoneyOnCNBC  https://t.co/ARdbDw5eHP
1286111022252724224 2020-07-22 18:28:57 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Congress needs to take steps to give America’s working families certainty during these troubling times. #FamiliesFirst @MadMoneyOnCNBC  https://t.co/GtfNOCYd1W

1285945911772938240 2020-07-22 07:32:51 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We all need to take responsibility for protecting our communities from COVID-19. The best action you can take yourself? #WearAMask. #OnWednesdaysWeWearPink  https://t.co/k4set0Szma
1285746692604809216 2020-07-21 18:21:14 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> One of the reasons we are so far behind in our response to the #TrumpVirus? We don’t have the equipment we need to test, process results, and protect our frontline workers. The President must make full use of the Defense Production Act immediately. #SitRoom  https://t.co/L2tBKjJlBD
1285650754481426432 2020-07-21 12:00:00 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump has no excuse. He must use the full power of the Defense Production Act to end the unacceptable shortages of testing, critical medical supplies and personal protective equipment. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/wm84nAYCrn
1285628232331665409 2020-07-21 10:30:31 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> In the 10 years since #DoddFrank became law, it has proven to be a critical tool in protecting consumers from predatory practices in the financial marketplace. Democrats will continue to vigilantly defend its reforms for years to come.  https://t.co/YS5lwyXjK7  https://t.co/8HzRDevrVa
1285579638778007553 2020-07-21 07:17:25 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Tune in this morning as we hold a ceremonial swearing-in for Rep.-elect Chris Jacobs of New York.  https://t.co/fIM3eu9gKw
1285334463396945920 2020-07-20 15:03:11 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The leadership shown by working men &amp; women across the country as part of the #StrikeForBlackLives is inspiring. Your commitment to ending racial injustice in health care, education, and the workplace is invaluable as we seek to build a brighter future for all Americans.
1285263454488723465 2020-07-20 10:21:01 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The @SenateGOP must join the House in passing H.R. 4 to #RestoreTheVRA protections which Rep. John Lewis spent so much of his life fighting to secure &amp; protect.  https://t.co/1R9xBbGn1Z
1284651577194749952 2020-07-18 17:49:38 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We live in a democracy, not a banana republic. We will not tolerate the use of Americans as props in President Trump’s political games.  Read my full statement with Rep. Earl Blumenauer here:  https://t.co/YGd6pnrHxT
1284349612434821120 2020-07-17 21:49:44 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> .@RepJohnLewis: hero, champion &amp; challenge to conscience of the nation. Your visit with the newest voices for justice at the Black Lives Matter mural with @MayorBowser was wonderful &amp; iconic. Thank you for that final public statement in furtherance of a more perfect union.  https://t.co/Us1tCmsYYd
1284336419398463488 2020-07-17 20:57:18 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> John Lewis’s memory moves us all to, in the face of injustice, make “good trouble, necessary trouble.” May it be a comfort to his son John-Miles &amp; his entire family that so many mourn their loss at this sad time.  https://t.co/cPEn54Tpi6
1284336417330651137 2020-07-17 20:57:18 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> .@RepJohnLewis was a titan of the civil rights movement whose goodness, faith and bravery transformed our nation. Every day of his life was dedicated to bringing freedom and justice to all.  https://t.co/xMbfAUhLUv
1284306982225182723 2020-07-17 19:00:20 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> First Amendment speech should never be met with one-sided violence from federal agents acting as Trump’s secret police, especially when unidentified. This is disgraceful behavior we would expect from a banana republic — not the government of the United States.
1284294427654197248 2020-07-17 18:10:27 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Unidentified stormtroopers. Unmarked cars. Kidnapping protesters and causing severe injuries in response to graffiti.  These are not the actions of a democratic republic.  @DHSgov’s actions in Portland undermine its mission.  Trump &amp; his stormtroopers must be stopped.
1284280162398474240 2020-07-17 17:13:46 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Instead of protecting people with pre-existing conditions, President Trump is in court defending his abusive junk plans while demanding that every last protection &amp; benefit of the ACA be struck down. Democrats will continue to #ProtectOurCare.  https://t.co/sFnzBxfUwL
1284264799652712450 2020-07-17 16:12:43 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The brutal police killing of Sean Monterrosa continues to shake the Bay Area. I join Sean’s family &amp; others in calling for an FBI investigation into Sean’s murder, including into the destruction of essential evidence in this homicide case.  https://t.co/FpwiBAoIU8
1283886290891673601 2020-07-16 15:08:39 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Testing is the solution that will allow us to safely reopen our economy and send children back to school. Right now, there isn’t enough equipment available to test at the levels we need. It’s time for @realDonaldTrump to fully employ the Defense Production Act.  https://t.co/OZchug0043
1283849312083030017 2020-07-16 12:41:43 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President’s dereliction of duty is dangerous. The Republican Senate must join the House in passing the #HeroesAct and calling on President Trump to use executive action for good.
1283849311260991491 2020-07-16 12:41:43 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Months into the crisis, there is still not enough personal protective equipment &amp; other medical supplies available to communities nationwide. But @realDonaldTrump refuses to fully employ the Defense Production Act to make that equipment available.
1283826611884830721 2020-07-16 11:11:31 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Observing the President’s behavior, it’s clear he is like a man who refuses to ask for directions.  All the answers are there. The scientists are clear: testing, tracing, isolation, and masks are critical.  And yet the President takes the wrong path.
1283480484497031169 2020-07-15 12:16:08 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We can’t solve the COVID-19 problem without the tools to do so. Every day President Trump fails to utilize the Defense Production Act &amp; Senate Republicans block the #HeroesAct, they are denying communities the tools they need to fight this pandemic.
1283469270014472193 2020-07-15 11:31:34 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Nearly 50,000 Americans have lost their lives to COVID-19 since the House passage of the #HeroesAct two months ago today. Our communities are demanding action. It’s time for the Republican Senate to stop blocking life-saving progress.  https://t.co/1qCPecrlEO
1283454537924214786 2020-07-15 10:33:01 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Nearly 2 million cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the U.S. since the House passed the #HeroesAct two months ago today.  At 2:30 pm ET, @HouseDemocrats will call on the Republican Senate to stop blocking this urgent legislation.  https://t.co/2fi357l3G3

1283223692718342144 2020-07-14 19:15:44 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President’s signing of the #HongKong Autonomy Act only begins to reverse the damage done after months of praising President Xi’s handling of coronavirus, years of selling out the human rights of Uyghurs &amp; reportedly asking President Xi for help to win his re-election.
1283212163641991170 2020-07-14 18:29:55 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Nothing is more important than meeting the needs of the American people as families across the country confront the health &amp; financial crises brought on by COVID-19. #HeroesAct  https://t.co/tE18RbDfiW
1282842118504013825 2020-07-13 17:59:29 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The #HeroesAct makes crucial investments to protect the lives &amp; livelihoods of people across the country. Enacting it is central to honoring our frontline workers. #MSNBCLive  https://t.co/607m5HBVd3
1282806392164950016 2020-07-13 15:37:31 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> There is a pathway to safely reopening our schools. The first step is putting our children first and passing the #HeroesAct to make sure our communities have the resources they need to test, treat and isolate. #MSNBCLive  https://t.co/i8nSNpLphQ
1282732388020256768 2020-07-13 10:43:27 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> A must read. Even in the middle of the coronavirus crisis, the President is trying to take away women’s health care &amp; all the protections in the ACA. Democrats will never stop fighting to defend and expand health care for all women &amp; girls in America.  https://t.co/2PK6UDUesq
1282331443105013762 2020-07-12 08:10:15 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump and his Administration are messing with the health of our children as they seek to rush schools to reopen. #CNNSOTU  https://t.co/fk6jd9rWgj
1282090941025857545 2020-07-11 16:14:35 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> No one — not even the President — is above the law. #PoliticsNation  https://t.co/ga5wkKbUI4
1281946769908260865 2020-07-11 06:41:42 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump’s decision to commute the sentence of top campaign advisor Roger Stone, who could directly implicate him in criminal misconduct, is an act of staggering corruption.  https://t.co/Ljqu2E71zs
1281784955803246592 2020-07-10 19:58:42 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The fact is the President has been a failure in every way. Now, his denial of the facts is threatening the safety of children &amp; families nationwide as he tries to rush reopening our schools. #AC360  https://t.co/EztELECasa
1281733250172542976 2020-07-10 16:33:14 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> For too long, Black &amp; brown communities across the country been silenced during discussions of environmental issues. Thanks to leaders like @RepMcEachin, House Democrats’ Climate Action Plan reflects our commitment to lifting up their voices as we confront the #ClimateCrisis.  https://t.co/fx66Rcn1c2
1281368430864732160 2020-07-09 16:23:35 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Americans nationwide are lifting up their voices to demand an end to police brutality. Urgent change is needed and the House-passed #JusticeInPolicing Act puts life-saving progress within reach. It’s time for the Republican Senate to step up. #GeorgeFloydLaw  https://t.co/UhGtUaUuA3
1281287609034178562 2020-07-09 11:02:25 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, the Supreme Court, including two of the President’s appointees, affirmed that President Trump is not above the law, recognized Congress’s constitutional authority to conduct oversight #ForThePeople &amp; upheld the separation of powers that is the genius of our Constitution.
1281243923076321280 2020-07-09 08:08:50 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Congress will continue to conduct oversight #ForThePeople, upholding the separation of powers that is the genius of our Constitution. We will continue to press our case in the lower courts.  https://t.co/Ax5KQdryJb
1281243922031837187 2020-07-09 08:08:50 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> A careful reading of the Supreme Court rulings related to the President’s financial records is not good news for President Trump. The Court has reaffirmed the Congress’s authority to conduct oversight on behalf of the people, as it asks for further information from the Congress.

1281043319276081160 2020-07-08 18:51:42 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President’s vindictiveness can't erase the truth: history will remember Lt. Col. Vindman as an American patriot, who proved his heroism both on the battlefield when he earned a Purple Heart &amp; in the House impeachment trial when he spoke truth to power.  https://t.co/9pYjvwSKM1
1280897010669957120 2020-07-08 09:10:19 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Supreme Court’s decision to enable the Trump Admin’s assault on women’s health, financial security &amp; independence is a fundamental misreading of the Affordable Care Act.  https://t.co/hfKenAmGye
1280629217256968196 2020-07-07 15:26:12 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Every day Leader McConnell &amp; the Republican Senate continue their blockade of the House-passed #HeroesAct is a day they are failing the American people. The United States is in the middle of a crisis. Congress has a duty to protect lives &amp; livelihoods from the coronavirus.
1280612714570813448 2020-07-07 14:20:38 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President’s official withdrawal of the U.S. from the World Health Organization is an act of true senselessness as @WHO coordinates the global fight against COVID-19. With millions of lives at risk, the President is crippling the international effort to defeat the virus.
1280254053134602246 2020-07-06 14:35:26 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> .@HouseDemocrats are committed to ensuring Congressional staff represent the full diversity &amp; dynamism of America.

1280198902168289280 2020-07-06 10:56:17 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> This weekend, our San Francisco family was once again struck by the tragic loss of a child to gun violence. No parent — no family — should have to feel this pain. Last year, the House passed H.R. 8 to #EndGunViolence. The Senate must take swift action.  https://t.co/5lTfM8QhZD
1279482793190404102 2020-07-04 11:30:44 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Happy Fourth of July!  https://t.co/ywgQiJven2
1279482792359886848 2020-07-04 11:30:43 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Generations of Americans have &amp; will continue to have the courage to fight for a more perfect union. Our military servicemembers have the courage to sacrifice their lives in defense of these principles — let us have the courage to work together to make those ideals a reality.
1279482791554678785 2020-07-04 11:30:43 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> On July 4, 1776, our Founders had the courage to declare that all are created equal and to fight a revolution for the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
1279198904853151745 2020-07-03 16:42:39 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The hearts of Americans nationwide are with Army Specialist Vanessa Guillen’s family as they mourn her tragic loss. We stand with them as they demand answers, and are grateful for @RepSylviaGarcia’s efforts to deliver justice &amp; protect all women serving our country.
1278837980921241600 2020-07-02 16:48:28 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> All freedom-loving people stand with the people of Hong Kong as they confront Beijing’s campaign against freedom. With my signature, the #HongKong Autonomy Act goes to the White House. The sanctions included within it are critical to holding China accountable.  https://t.co/prgInYxw3l
1278820802687905796 2020-07-02 15:40:13 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> For 56 years, the Civil Rights Act has stood as a victory of fairness, justice &amp; equality — yet its full promise remains unfulfilled. Today, we recommit ourselves to building a more just &amp; equal future for all Americans.  https://t.co/qYwn1kC9kP  https://t.co/MDVsErDyiz

1278516069074952198 2020-07-01 19:29:19 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> As we extend the Paycheck Protection Program to Aug. 8, I continue to call on the Trump Admin to release the data of who has received its benefits.

1278514015044542465 2020-07-01 19:21:09 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The #MovingForward Act takes bold, transformational action to rebuild our infrastructure, creating millions of jobs in communities nationwide. We urge the Senate to join the House in supporting this legislation.  https://t.co/iA75ySQWuo
1278504969147162627 2020-07-01 18:45:12 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The U.S. Congress has long been united in a bipartisan mission to hold Beijing accountable for its human rights abuses. The Hong Kong Autonomy Act, passed by the House today, is an urgently-needed response to China’s so-called “national security” law.  https://t.co/VvWIPMvG2A
1278501139051360256 2020-07-01 18:29:59 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President has proved himself to be wholly unqualified and ethically unfit to serve – and now he has undermined any credibility he may have had as Commander in Chief. @DeadlineWH  https://t.co/OVrTetPp9r

1278421568943775746 2020-07-01 13:13:48 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> As America faces this health care crisis, Democrats are taking action to #LowerCostsForCare. The House-passed Patient Protection &amp; Affordable Care Enhancement Act would expand coverage, negotiate lower drug prices and cut Americans’ health costs during these tough times.  https://t.co/iltlBJuGU7

1277998000124694529 2020-06-30 09:10:41 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump must hold Chinese officials accountable by deploying sanctions under the 2016 Magnitsky Act and taking steps under the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, proudly passed by Congress.  https://t.co/1AWktOKAOk
1277997999306801154 2020-06-30 09:10:41 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The brutal purpose of Beijing’s so-called “national security” law is to frighten, intimidate &amp; suppress the speech of Hong Kongers. All freedom-loving people must come together to condemn this law, which signals the death of the “one country, two systems” principle.

1277661464547995650 2020-06-29 10:53:25 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Supreme Court’s ruling in June Medical Services v. Russo is a victory for women’s health &amp; freedoms. Louisiana’s draconian abortion ban was a clear violation of the Constitution, specifically designed dismantle their right to make their own health &amp; family decisions.
1277598270844526596 2020-06-29 06:42:19 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> For 45 days, the Senate has refused to act on the House-passed #HeroesAct. As states across the country confront surging cases of COVID-19, Leader McConnell must enter into bipartisan, bicameral negotiations on next steps. Read my letter with @SenSchumer:  https://t.co/cDnGvZywmv
1277431315105710081 2020-06-28 19:38:53 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> As the San Francisco community marks 50 years of #Pride, we celebrate the progress we have achieved against bigotry &amp; discrimination – and recommit ourselves to the fight for full equality for all LGBTQ people.  https://t.co/xakeiktFyV
1277306010173087745 2020-06-28 11:20:58 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The shocking reports about Russia’s bounty on American troops is as bad as it gets – and still, President Trump refuses to confront Putin. #ThisWeek  https://t.co/oeT0RgruOL
1277270977366327298 2020-06-28 09:01:46 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> It is time for the Trump Administration to take the threat posed by the coronavirus seriously. #ThisWeek  https://t.co/7fuAilrbl9
1276642671604281345 2020-06-26 15:25:06 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> .@RepSeanMaloney’s message to us all is clear &amp; simple: #PrideMonth may be different this year, but its fundamental promise has never been more important.  https://t.co/GcCSatS7Q6
1276615475376652288 2020-06-26 13:37:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Five years after the Supreme Court declared that marriage is a right of all people, regardless of who you are or whom you love, the love and commitment of countless LGBTQ couples &amp; families enriches our communities and our country. #LoveIsLove  https://t.co/K7RP4tWCGm  https://t.co/0gNB1lC8oM
1276570756944728064 2020-06-26 10:39:20 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Such a touching way to mark #Pride2020!   I’m proud of the legacy &amp; memory of Phyllis Lyon &amp; Del Martin. They inspired all of us who counted them as friends, &amp; their work for equality benefited countless LGBTQ Americans.   @RepMarkTakano, have you taken the #HousePrideChallenge?  https://t.co/ANsXPR8K0P
1276528817667014657 2020-06-26 07:52:41 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Last night, the House took decisive action to secure justice for Black Americans killed by police brutality, passing the George Floyd #JusticeInPolicing Act. Tune in as I discuss this &amp; more with reporters at the U.S. Capitol.  https://t.co/USH0XXEDdE
1276515640950562817 2020-06-26 07:00:19 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> I will be speaking with reporters live from the U.S. Capitol at 10:45 am ET.  Watch here:  https://t.co/zU3Pjl0oUv
1276502702101540865 2020-06-26 06:08:55 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> As America faces this public health crisis, it is crucial that the Senate take action on House-passed legislation to #RenewTheVRA and ensure all Americans are able to cast their ballot this November.  https://t.co/rAHIopCB0G
1276353973822382082 2020-06-25 20:17:55 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> In the dead of night, the Trump Administration has once again asked the Supreme Court to rip away the protections and benefits of the Affordable Care Act in the middle of the coronavirus crisis. #ProtectOurCare  https://t.co/IB0oglIMDV
1276347621548982272 2020-06-25 19:52:41 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today should have been Tamir Rice's 18th birthday. With tonight's passage of the George Floyd #JusticeInPolicing Act, the House has taken a historic step toward securing justice for Tamir &amp; all Black Americans killed by police brutality. #GeorgeFloydLaw  https://t.co/iN1qdswX3f
1276346428827275264 2020-06-25 19:47:56 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> This evening, the House rejected the Senate’s toothless proposal – and passed the George Floyd #JusticeInPolicing Act on a bipartisan vote. It’s time for the Senate to sit down and come to an agreement on legislation they can pass. #inners  https://t.co/xS7nnOWZPx
1276264167247433728 2020-06-25 14:21:03 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Thank you to @janschakowsky, @RepTedDeutch, @RepSchneider &amp; @RepDavidEPrice for organizing our colleagues to send this important message.
1276154745628090372 2020-06-25 07:06:15 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Americans nationwide are calling for swift, bold action to secure justice for Black Americans killed by police brutality. Today, the House will take the historic step of passing the George Floyd #JusticeInPolicing Act.  https://t.co/2QGxNF81MU
1276134109656633345 2020-06-25 05:44:15 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> House Democrats will speak live from the U.S. Capitol at 10 am ET ahead of today’s historic vote on the George Floyd #JusticeInPolicing Act.  Tune in here:  https://t.co/rFd2fqW3Qv
1275868597726969857 2020-06-24 12:09:12 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Millions of Americans are calling for swift action to secure justice for all who have lost their lives to police brutality. Congress can deliver it by sending the George Floyd #JusticeInPolicing Act to the President.  https://t.co/gYpniQVVqO
1275793200024899586 2020-06-24 07:09:36 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Disappointing that Senate GOP has ignored the voices of hundreds of thousands peacefully calling out for justice. Their proposal mimics the words of real reform but takes no action &amp; makes no difference. It is unworthy of support. Congress must pass the #JusticeInPolicing Act.
1275792591494275072 2020-06-24 07:07:11 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Now more than ever, Congress must take action to #LowerCostsForCare for Americans nationwide. Tune in as Democrats take a key step #ForThePeople as we introduce the Patient Protection &amp; Affordable Care Enhancement Act.  https://t.co/cWMLcJbMQj
1275103001880006656 2020-06-22 09:27:00 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump’s admission that he is looking the other way and enabling China’s brutal repression of the Uyghur people and other Muslim minorities in order to ink a trade deal is appalling.  https://t.co/HG75qYPf6E
1274747660294131712 2020-06-21 09:55:00 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Senator McConnell must stop obstructing the #HeroesAct and the life-saving testing resources it provides. #FamiliesFirst
1274747659346153472 2020-06-21 09:55:00 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Testing, tracing, treatment &amp; social distancing are the only tools we have to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The President’s efforts to slow down testing to hide the true extent of the virus means more Americans will lose their lives.   https://t.co/rMoe3Rg48M
1274716658263875585 2020-06-21 07:51:49 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Wishing you all a Happy #FathersDay! May you all find time to celebrate with your family &amp; loved ones.  https://t.co/vBuWpiOxB5
1274475757490692097 2020-06-20 15:54:33 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Congressional oversight of the Executive Branch is needed to protect the integrity of our legal system, which is under serious threat from this White House.
1274475756542988288 2020-06-20 15:54:33 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President and his cronies have chosen to protect Trump’s personal &amp; political interests over those of the American people by interfering in numerous criminal investigations involving the President &amp; his associates.  https://t.co/zuWcYtSrDg
1274405640862142465 2020-06-20 11:15:56 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The urgent message of @RevDrBarber &amp; the #PoorPeoplesCampaign is clear &amp; undeniable. Thank you for raising your voices to lift up the stories of the 140 million poor &amp; low-income Americans. @HouseDemocrats hear you &amp; stand with you. The times have found us. @UniteThePoor
1274127919137374208 2020-06-19 16:52:22 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, the House filed an amicus brief in federal court opposing the Trump Admin’s failure to reopen Affordable Care Act enrollment to ensure workers have access to life-saving coverage.  Read the brief here:  https://t.co/lCgon65Stf
1274127236417966082 2020-06-19 16:49:39 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> America is enriched by the moral example of @RevDrBarber &amp; Rev. Dr. @liztheo as they guide the #PoorPeoplesCampaign. To you both, thank you. Your message inspires us all to turn our hope for a brighter, more just future into action.
1274065639368425472 2020-06-19 12:44:54 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We have a moral duty to oppose injustice wherever it appears. In honor of #Juneteenth, the portraits of four previous Speakers who served in the Confederacy were removed from display in the U.S. Capitol. There is no room in these halls for honoring men who embody racism &amp; hatred.  https://t.co/aTPa89mOAe
1273980981029019649 2020-06-19 07:08:29 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> During this time of national anguish, this #Juneteenth must be a day of reflection that moves our nation to finally confront and combat its long &amp; shameful history of systemic racial injustice targeted at communities of color.  https://t.co/ntSTxLysux
1273980979204567046 2020-06-19 07:08:29 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> #Juneteenth stands as a beautiful celebration of freedom for African Americans. 155 years after the start of this proud tradition, it carries even greater weight, as people nationwide unite to demand justice for Black Americans killed by racial injustice &amp; police brutality.  https://t.co/9APhweKoDi
1273748268464439296 2020-06-18 15:43:46 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The American people have entrusted the Congress with leading our nation. Let us lead by example by removing these images from display in the People’s House.  https://t.co/1tNM5F2BYk
1273748266161709059 2020-06-18 15:43:46 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The portraits of these men are symbols that set back our nation’s work to confront and combat bigotry.  https://t.co/vr1Vf6sDOR
1273748263804579840 2020-06-18 15:43:45 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The halls of Congress are the very heart of our democracy. Allowing men who embody the grotesque racism of the Confederacy to be honored within them is unacceptable.  https://t.co/ABQtkxKIzN
1273748261455757312 2020-06-18 15:43:45 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Ahead of tomorrow’s #Juneteenth observances, the portraits of four previous Speakers who served in the Confederacy have been removed from the walls of the U.S. Capitol under the supervision of House Clerk Cheryl Johnson.  https://t.co/8GpnHLVs9X
1273719043783090177 2020-06-18 13:47:39 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Our Dreamers need and deserve real, permanent action. It’s time for the Senate finally secure progress by passing H.R. 6, the American Dream &amp; Promise Act.  https://t.co/zT1mQ1kBvA
1273719043036454921 2020-06-18 13:47:39 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Supreme Court’s rejection of President Trump’s illegal, immoral attacks on young immigrants is a victory for American values. #Dreamers make America more American.
1273662049051082752 2020-06-18 10:01:10 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> It’s time for bold action to rebuild America’s infrastructure. #MovingForward  https://t.co/4m3Bt3HZRL
1273658744942088192 2020-06-18 09:48:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, @HouseDemocrats are unveiling the #MovingForward Act: bold legislation to rebuild America’s infrastructure.  Tune in at 1 pm:  https://t.co/MoOTAIYG7g
1273630951524925440 2020-06-18 07:57:36 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Tune in as I speak with reporters live at the U.S. Capitol in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling on DACA. #Dreamers  https://t.co/OpvyM1bcue
1273621867987951616 2020-06-18 07:21:30 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> I will be speaking with reporters live at the U.S. Capitol at 10:45 am ET. Tune in here:  https://t.co/doGqs78xFL
1273416050126786562 2020-06-17 17:43:39 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> March 17: 100 known COVID-19 deaths in the United States.  June 17: More than 117,000 deaths in the United States.   The Vice President thinks the Trump Admin’s response is “a cause for celebration.”   I couldn’t disagree more. #CNNNewsroom  https://t.co/i9AF5Yq89X
1273393053701746697 2020-06-17 16:12:17 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> American women are bearing the brunt of the twin health &amp; economic crises caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Grateful to @HouseDemWomen for calling on Leader McConnell &amp; the GOP Senate to pass the #HeroesAct immediately. #FamiliesFirst   Read their letter:  https://t.co/MvQICtYXFy
1273392540268584962 2020-06-17 16:10:14 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump &amp; Leader McConnell have offered Americans weak, toothless proposals that fail to deliver #JusticeInPolicing.   We don’t need window dressings, we need real change. #CNNNewsroom  https://t.co/YC3I8AJXwu
1273310578124128258 2020-06-17 10:44:33 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> American workers are paying the price for Leader McConnell’s efforts to slow-walk our response to COVID-19. Truly inspiring to witness today’s caravan of workers in Washington, driving together to demand that the #SenateActNow to pass the #HeroesAct. #WorkersFirst  https://t.co/W4I4w5wxxZ
1273258266852765700 2020-06-17 07:16:41 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Grateful to @RepKarenBass &amp; @TheBlackCaucus for their leadership on fighting police brutality &amp; racial injustice. Their expertise &amp; experiences form the foundation of the #JusticeInPolicing Act. Together, we will secure the change &amp; justice Americans are demanding.  https://t.co/qM6U4Pg3WL
1273062467833401345 2020-06-16 18:18:39 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump claimed he was offering a real solution to police brutality. The #FakeReform he offered instead fell far short. #DeadlineWH  https://t.co/lYmcEBtGfj
1273043727234326528 2020-06-16 17:04:11 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The #JusticeInPolicing Act represents a giant step forward in the fight against police brutality. This about saving lives — Leader McConnell’s opposition makes it clear how committed he is to living up to “Grim Reaper” moniker he has given himself. #DeadlineWH  https://t.co/uDqfzgNe6O
1272974657700978688 2020-06-16 12:29:43 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> For too long, residents of Washington, DC, have been denied their right to fully participate in our democracy — an injustice put on full display two weeks ago at Lafayette Square.  Next week, the House will vote on historic #DCStatehood legislation championed by @EleanorNorton.  https://t.co/O1GmV3rVMz
1272964716663574531 2020-06-16 11:50:13 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President’s Executive Order falls seriously short of what is required to combat the epidemic of racial injustice &amp; police brutality that is murdering Black Americans. We must insist on the bold change found in the George Floyd #JusticeInPolicing Act.  https://t.co/tjNVJCiU3u
1272709994643894272 2020-06-15 18:58:03 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Last year, House Democrats renewed our commitment to progress by introducing and passing the American Dream &amp; Promise Act, which would provide more than 2 million Dreamers a shot at the American Dream. It’s time for Senate Republicans to stop stonewalling &amp; stand with Dreamers.
1272709993654034432 2020-06-15 18:58:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Eight years after DACA began, it continues to give #Dreamers the peace-of-mind to fully participate in their communities. Democrats will never stop fighting to ensure DACA recipients are protected from the Trump Admin’s shameful attacks.
1272697746047336449 2020-06-15 18:09:22 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Supreme Court’s ruling today secures critical protections for LGBTQ Americans across the country – but it’s far from the end. Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans must stop holding up the #EqualityAct and finally vote for progress. #SitRoom  https://t.co/zWad2qUFc0
1272582112042987523 2020-06-15 10:29:53 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Trump Admin’s attempts to coerce state and local law enforcement into becoming an deportation dragnet were driven by bigotry, not the security of our communities. The Supreme Court’s rejection of these cruel efforts is a victory for public safety.  https://t.co/xz4h69Jgrb
1272558464179503112 2020-06-15 08:55:55 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Meanwhile, the Trump Admin continues to advance a hateful anti-LGBTQ agenda that threatens the health &amp; well-being of countless LGBTQ Americans and their families. The Senate must fully end LGBTQ discrimination by passing the #EqualityAct.
1272558462904553474 2020-06-15 08:55:55 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today’s momentous Supreme Court ruling affirms that all Americans, regardless of who you are or whom you love, are protected from discrimination in the workplace under federal law. Thank you to all whose activism &amp; courage made this victory possible.  https://t.co/muOYbHpJNg
1271642112652705792 2020-06-12 20:14:40 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Our nation is in the midst of a health and economic crisis of staggering proportions. The Administration’s shameful rule is an attack on the health care of women, communities of color, seniors, the disabled and the LGBTQ community.  https://t.co/IXNfjkNeGY
1271616325392175104 2020-06-12 18:32:12 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The American people deserve answers to ensure that the CARES Act’s historic investment of their taxpayer money is used wisely and effectively to save lives and livelihoods, not to be used by profiteers and price-gougers. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/9n9WIIjjb2
1271536837333565441 2020-06-12 13:16:20 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Led by @RepKarenBass and @TheBlackCaucus, Congress is taking decisive action to secure #JusticeInPolicing for communities across America.  https://t.co/y2zlXf7i7d
1271457294748958720 2020-06-12 08:00:16 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Four years ago, 49 beautiful souls were lost &amp; 53 injured in a shocking act of hatred at Orlando’s Pulse Nightclub. Today, we recommit ourselves to honoring their memory &amp; call on the Senate to finally vote on House-passed #EndGunViolence legislation.  https://t.co/K1PJXLNCIu
1271167241095122944 2020-06-11 12:47:42 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> What we saw in Georgia during Tuesday’s election was shameful. It was either a disgrace of incompetence or a disgrace of intention. Whichever it was, our response must be to inoculate our elections against predictable threats and protect voting rights nationwide.
1271095319774846981 2020-06-11 08:01:54 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> This week, @HouseDemocrats &amp; @SenateDems unveiled the #JusticeInPolicing Act. Tune in as I discuss this and more with reporters on Capitol Hill.  https://t.co/2e2irhVZ17
1270874701900976128 2020-06-10 17:25:15 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Tune in tomorrow for my conversation with @TIME’s Molly Ball about what lies ahead for Congress and finding hope in these troubling times. #TIME100Talks  https://t.co/4xRW6X8ysB  https://t.co/tGJXhpZUIM
1270852699303694338 2020-06-10 15:57:49 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The people have spoken. They have done so, day in and day out, for weeks. Together, we can secure #JusticeInPolicing.  https://t.co/cw7MJ9wr9Q
1270844198447702018 2020-06-10 15:24:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Philonise Floyd’s heart-wrenching testimony to @HouseJudiciary left its mark on us all. May this flag, which flew over the Capitol on the day of his brother’s murder, serve as a symbol of our shared commitment to securing justice for George &amp; all victims of police violence.  https://t.co/Dl3LXDGF7t
1270831124948955141 2020-06-10 14:32:05 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Read my letter here:  https://t.co/lx0nuYxrfk
1270831123745120258 2020-06-10 14:32:05 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The statues which fill the halls of Congress should reflect our highest ideals as Americans. Today, I am once again calling for the removal from the U.S. Capitol of the 11 statues representing Confederate soldiers and officials. These statues pay homage to hate, not heritage.
1270754451536719874 2020-06-10 09:27:25 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The @USCBO’s chilling report on the projected decline in GDP confirms the life-and-death stakes of Congress’s action to stem the economic hemorrhaging from COVID-19.  Now is not the time to take our foot off the gas.  https://t.co/iPsT7vMxUs
1270537169095065600 2020-06-09 19:04:01 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> I’m honored to receive @CARE's first Women’s Empowerment Award during today’s virtual festivities celebrating their 75 years of global leadership. I am committed to robustly funding vital global health initiatives to defeat COVID-19 &amp; improve response capacity worldwide.
1270130865645981696 2020-06-08 16:09:30 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> This is not a time for slogans designed to distract the American people. It is time for action to protect American lives and livelihoods. The Senate must take immediate action to pass the #HeroesAct. #MSNBCLive  https://t.co/RHUqIwiRVl
1270098967985078272 2020-06-08 14:02:45 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Every Member of Congress takes an oath to protect and defend the American people. Passing the #JusticeInPolicing Act is essential to fulfilling that duty. #MSNBCLive  https://t.co/7c72vHV9qz
1270064370572308480 2020-06-08 11:45:17 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Read my full letter with @SenSchumer:  https://t.co/difzi9LJ1B
1270064368219193344 2020-06-08 11:45:16 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President must immediately reopen Lafayette Square to the public.  This unique park should be a symbol of freedom &amp; openness, not a militarized zone behind which President Trump cowers in fear of protesters who are crying out for justice.  https://t.co/xvsVjtfsO2
1270002623291195392 2020-06-08 07:39:55 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Across the country, Americans are calling for action to end police brutality and racial injustice. Today, @HouseDemocrats &amp; @SenateDems are unveiling the #JusticeInPolicing Act.  https://t.co/wG7CGJvPoh
1269994260536975364 2020-06-08 07:06:41 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> House &amp; Senate Democrats are coming together at 10:30 am ET to unveil the #JusticeInPolicing Act of 2020.  Tune in here:  https://t.co/rFd2fqW3Qv
1269331341289705473 2020-06-06 11:12:29 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> 76 years after Allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy on D-Day, we remain in awe of their heroism. Today and every day, we give thanks for their courage and the commitment of all freedom-loving people who contributed to their victory.  https://t.co/aTWdTdC3ts
1269009593100795913 2020-06-05 13:53:58 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, we #WearOrange to remember the beautiful souls we have lost to gun violence and as a sign of our commitment to ending the suffering that violence brings to communities nationwide. By making our voices heard &amp; working together, we can achieve life-saving progress.  https://t.co/OaAjK1749i
1268958783621025793 2020-06-05 10:32:04 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Real men wear masks. #FamiliesFirst @MadMoneyOnCNBC  https://t.co/T0ybbr1zl8

1268948219180003328 2020-06-05 09:50:06 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> May’s #JobsReport shows that decisive Congressional action can make a difference in our economy. But as coronavirus continues to spread w/o adequate testing &amp; tracing, this is the worst possible time to take our foot off the gas. The Senate must quickly pass the #HeroesAct.
1268728683814100992 2020-06-04 19:17:44 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> As we mark 31 years since the #Tiananmen Square Massacre, Congress is in bipartisan agreement — we cannot be naive when it comes to China. We must present a united front.  https://t.co/7SQHVmaTqZ
1268663920551694339 2020-06-04 15:00:23 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The scale of economic devastation caused by COVID-19 is staggering. House Democrats passed the PPP Flexibility Act to protect workers &amp; small businesses. With my signature, it goes to the White House. The President must put #FamiliesFirst and sign it into law immediately.  https://t.co/mL4NA13Okw
1268658740930232321 2020-06-04 14:39:49 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President’s Executive Order waiving critical environmental protections is a direct threat to the environment. The President has proven once again his utter contempt for our laws, as well as the communities &amp; ecosystems they protect.  https://t.co/Iw6Tx9qVfL
1268609104756592642 2020-06-04 11:22:34 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Read my full letter to the President here:  https://t.co/qBgd23LET8
1268609103686967297 2020-06-04 11:22:34 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Americans deserve to know: Who is in charge? What is the chain of command? What is the mission? What agencies are involved? What are their roles &amp; responsibilities? And by what authority is the National Guard from other states operating in the Capital?
1268609102520840193 2020-06-04 11:22:34 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Of particular concern are officers who are operating with full anonymity, refusing to provide identification and without identifying insignia, badges and nameplates – a practice which undermines accountability and ignites government distrust &amp; suspicion.
1268609100058750976 2020-06-04 11:22:33 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> As Americans across the country peacefully protest to demand an end to racial injustice and police brutality, we have seen a shocking deployment of various security officers from multiple jurisdictions to our nation’s capital. Today, I wrote to the President seeking answers.  https://t.co/tANprwPH2S
1268606676464291840 2020-06-04 11:12:55 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Tune in as I speak with reporters during my weekly press conference at the U.S. Capitol.  https://t.co/p5ro5eAdBK
1268589837780746246 2020-06-04 10:06:01 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> I will be speaking with reporters live at the U.S. Capitol at 2 pm ET.  Watch here:  https://t.co/rFd2fqW3Qv
1268557025266536455 2020-06-04 07:55:38 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Two years after protestors were met with violence &amp; death, I joined my colleagues in unfurling a banner in Tiananmen Square which read: “To those who died for democracy.”  To this day, we are firmly committed to standing up against China’s abuses of human rights.  https://t.co/JFdPoVNmpr
1268557024348037120 2020-06-04 07:55:37 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> For 31 years, the courageous students, workers and citizens who defied an oppressive Chinese regime in #Tiananmen Square have lived in the memory of all freedom-loving people. May their example move us to ensure that America truly lives up to its ideals.  https://t.co/Qffw3aiGp1
1268376952815190022 2020-06-03 20:00:05 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Thank you, San Francisco, for this evening’s powerful telephone townhall on Congressional action to combat COVID-19 and police brutality — and to our guests @RepBarbaraLee, Dr. Susan Phillip of the @SF_DPH and Shon Buford of @SFFFLocal798 for the deep conversation.
1268265652386697218 2020-06-03 12:37:49 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> In the days and weeks to come, we will be guided by the experiences &amp; expertise of @RepKarenBass and @TheBlackCaucus as we seek to achieve progress &amp; secure justice for Americans nationwide.
1268265651707273216 2020-06-03 12:37:49 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Stopping police violence must be a priority in this country if we are to ever come to terms with America’s history of racial injustice. Congress must address deadly use of force by police and reform policing practices. #BlackLivesMatter
1267951884947595266 2020-06-02 15:51:01 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Now is the time to heal — to take action to address the pattern &amp; history of police brutality and racial injustice in America.  https://t.co/HtlglNl2qE
1267820446566674443 2020-06-02 07:08:44 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> With my signature, the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, which imposes sanction on foreign individuals and entities responsible for human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region, goes to the White House.  https://t.co/shWZMPYbDf
1267648676056510465 2020-06-01 19:46:10 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> At this challenging time, our nation needs real leadership. The President’s continued fanning of the flames of discord, bigotry and violence is cowardly, weak and dangerous.  Read my full statement with @SenSchumer:  https://t.co/6bDuH0C3sU
1267648675339218946 2020-06-01 19:46:10 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Tear-gassing peaceful protestors without provocation just so that the President could pose for photos outside a church dishonors every value that faith teaches us.
1267648674491969536 2020-06-01 19:46:10 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Across our country, Americans are protesting for an end to the pattern of racial injustice and brutality we saw most recently in the murder of #GeorgeFloyd. Yet, at a time when our country cries out for unification, this President is ripping it apart.
1267502848033599489 2020-06-01 10:06:42 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Hatred will never defeat pride. #PRIDE2020  https://t.co/sSOtaebeY7
1267502846653726729 2020-06-01 10:06:42 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> More than 50 years after Stonewall, #PrideMonth is celebrated as a testament to the progress we’ve achieved in the fight against bigotry &amp; discrimination — and stands as a reminder of the work that remains to achieve full equality for LGBTQ people and all Americans.  https://t.co/W4Q1tk6c2f
1267170254649786371 2020-05-31 12:05:06 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Democratic and Republican presidents alike have seen it as their responsibility to be a unifying force in our country, not to fuel the flame. President Trump has made clear he would rather distract than perform his duty. #ThisWeek  https://t.co/doBVGKU4MT
1267148596392198146 2020-05-31 10:39:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> House Democrats are leading voices in the fight for progress nationwide. We are committed to fighting injustice wherever it arises, whether in law enforcement or in America’s response to COVID-19. #ThisWeek  https://t.co/aAJwiNjrhv
1266542872427474946 2020-05-29 18:32:06 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Read my full statement here:  https://t.co/tJdlr3zHuv
1266542871429120001 2020-05-29 18:32:06 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> If President Trump is serious about confronting China’s human rights abuses, he must work with Congress to craft an effective, robust strategy. His vague suggestions for confronting China’s actions are nothing new &amp; do not articulate a real or serious strategy.
1266521884495052801 2020-05-29 17:08:42 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President's withdrawal from @WHO as it leads the fight against COVID-19 is an act of extraordinary senselessness. Again and again, he blames others and refuses to take responsibility. Only with a coordinated global response will we defeat this virus.
1266512201399009280 2020-05-29 16:30:14 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The House &amp; Senate firmly stood with our students &amp; veterans to reject the Admin’s cruel decision to turn its back on thousands defrauded by predatory colleges. It is sad that the President rejected the will of the Congress and the Country with his veto.  https://t.co/lrcQb0dSyZ
1266441092955766784 2020-05-29 11:47:40 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump’s failure to provide consistent and stable leadership has brought us to where we are today. Chairman @FrankPallone is leading the fight to implement a national COVID-19 testing program by enacting the #HeroesAct. We must act swiftly.  https://t.co/JBDACSGWi2
1266119568692523008 2020-05-28 14:30:03 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> It’s no secret that we need to expand testing nationwide. Instead of refusing to face reality, the GOP Senate must step up and pass the #HeroesAct in order to expand testing &amp; support our heroic frontline workers. #AMR  https://t.co/xQcGRwOHtZ
1266104161176678400 2020-05-28 13:28:49 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The horrific murder of #GeorgeFloyd has broken our hearts. His family deserves justice, as do countless other black people who've been killed in this country. Congress is committed to finding solutions to prevent these crimes &amp; root out the systemic injustice in our society.
1266100556625522689 2020-05-28 13:14:30 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Read my full statement here:  https://t.co/0SdfDDUZsS
1266100555950297093 2020-05-28 13:14:30 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Allowing the spread of disinformation is extremely dangerous. Yet still, the President encourages Facebook &amp; others to continue to exploit and profit off falsehoods – while directing the federal government to dismantle efforts to help users distinguish fact from fiction.
1266085197092737026 2020-05-28 12:13:28 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> If America does not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interests, we lose all moral authority to speak out elsewhere.
1266085196207722496 2020-05-28 12:13:28 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Administration should work with Congress on an appropriate response which considers all tools available, including visa limitations and economic penalties.
1266085195515670529 2020-05-28 12:13:27 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> This excessive law brazenly accelerates Beijing’s years-long assault on Hong Kong’s political and economic freedoms, coming after the threat of the extradition bill and of police brutality last fall. All freedom-loving people must come together to condemn this law.
1266085194777464833 2020-05-28 12:13:27 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The so-called “national security framework” – Beijing’s latest move against Hong Kong – threatens the death of the ‘one country, two systems’ principle.  https://t.co/rDNOkNj8wh
1266021777462956033 2020-05-28 08:01:27 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Newly-released unemployment data shows that 1-in-4 American workers have filed for unemployment during this public health crisis. Now more than ever, the Senate must pass the House-passed #HeroesAct and put #FamiliesFirst.  https://t.co/ZjTB9fuvCm
1266009483177873408 2020-05-28 07:12:36 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> I will be speaking with reporters regarding the ongoing efforts to put #FamiliesFirst in our COVID-19 crisis response at 10:45 am ET at the U.S. Capitol.  Tune in here:  https://t.co/rFd2fqW3Qv
1265816952087482368 2020-05-27 18:27:33 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The best thing we can do to stimulate our economy is to put money into the pockets of the American people. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/wo8zwmSWnJ
1265800384985075713 2020-05-27 17:21:43 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We have a responsibility to defeat COVID-19. It’s time for President Trump to stop making excuses and take responsibility. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/XXeYAhYy9v
1265781870547152896 2020-05-27 16:08:09 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Leader McConnell thinks Congress should pause it’s response to this crisis.  Last time I checked, the virus isn’t taking a pause. Neither should we.  The Senate must pass the #HeroesAct immediately. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/2DFjDHEbLc
1265756254334525445 2020-05-27 14:26:22 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> At a time when fear &amp; bigotry led many to ignore the human toll of the AIDS epidemic, Larry Kramer was a relentless, dissatisfied voice for justice. Through his activism, Larry demanded attention and saved lives. His vision &amp; leadership will continue to inspire us all.
1265712323236413440 2020-05-27 11:31:48 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Tragically, 100,000 people across America have lost their lives to COVID-19. Meanwhile, there is still no strong, nationwide plan to expand testing like the one in the #HeroesAct.  The Senate must pass it immediately.  https://t.co/GLTbm8UqHt
1265705769913274380 2020-05-27 11:05:45 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> As we learn that 100,000 lives have been lost to COVID-19, it is clearer than ever that we must enact the strong testing plan passed as part of the #HeroesAct. #FamiliesFirst  Tune in at 2:30 pm ET to learn more:  https://t.co/rFd2fqW3Qv
1265633731068518407 2020-05-27 06:19:30 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Voting at home shouldn’t be a question of politics. It’s a health issue. No American should have to choose between their protecting their health and exercising their right to vote. #inners  https://t.co/SxgOvhgwg4
1265061883826012161 2020-05-25 16:27:11 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We are eternally grateful for the courage &amp; service of the men and women who gave their last full measure of devotion for our country. On this #MemorialDay, we honor their memory and #RememberTheFallen. @WWIIMemorial  https://t.co/lmckZus03b
1264931804403978240 2020-05-25 07:50:18 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Read my joint statement with @SenSchumer, Rep. @FrankPallone and Sen. @PattyMurray here:  https://t.co/4lY3wCNvYJ
1264931802084446210 2020-05-25 07:50:17 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> .@SenateMajLdr must stop obstructing the House-passed #HeroesAct, which would deliver a clear strategy and $75 billion for the testing and contact tracing necessary to stop the spread of this vicious virus.
1264931801476276224 2020-05-25 07:50:17 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> To reopen our economy safely, we need testing to be free, accurate, reliable and accompanied by tools like contact tracing so we can slow the spread of the virus and prevent outbreaks.
1264931799320363010 2020-05-25 07:50:16 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Administration’s disappointing report confirms that President Trump’s national testing strategy is to deny the truth that there aren’t enough tests and supplies, reject responsibility and dump the burden onto the states.
1264931798418632705 2020-05-25 07:50:16 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> After six months and nearly 100,000 lives lost, the Trump Administration still does not have a serious plan for increasing testing to stop the spread of the virus.
1264927336299888641 2020-05-25 07:32:32 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, our nation faces a challenge equal to any in our history. We reaffirm our commitment to caring for and supporting our military families, veterans, wounded warriors, active duty troops, as well as the National Guard &amp; Reservists on the frontlines of this crisis.
1264927333905022978 2020-05-25 07:32:32 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Each #MemorialDay, all Americans unite in honoring the patriots who made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. These brave men and women in uniform safeguarded our most cherished values and helped build a brighter future for all Americans.  https://t.co/nLWKSg8Iy6  https://t.co/x3ftUDnHXL
1264635497390972930 2020-05-24 12:12:53 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> -Nearly 100,000 lives have been lost -Almost 40 million are jobless -1 in 5 children are going hungry  But the Trump White House is obsessed with a capital gains tax break for the wealthiest few.   Democrats passed the #HeroesAct For The People — now the GOP Senate must join us.
1264585670615588864 2020-05-24 08:54:53 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The losses suffered by our American family have been staggering — every story heartbreaking in its own way. As we near 100,000 lives lost, we pray for those who have passed, their loved ones and all who are working to save lives &amp; protect our communities.  https://t.co/vaBsirLu5c
1264355294815150081 2020-05-23 17:39:27 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> As always, our firefighters are our heroes. Many thanks to our San Francisco Fire Department for their courage and effectiveness in fighting the fire at Pier 45. Our prayers are with them. @SFFDPIO

1263908184613404672 2020-05-22 12:02:48 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Withdrawing from the Open Skies Treaty without a replacement further undermines America’s credibility in the global community and makes Americans less safe.  https://t.co/wir9s8at1f
1263844258773164033 2020-05-22 07:48:47 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Harvey Milk was a man of extraordinary vision and tenacity, who challenged us all to fight for a better future for the LGBTQ community &amp; all Americans. His relentless optimism remains an inspiration as we confront this unprecedented crisis. #HarveyMilkDay  https://t.co/mXtpKtSdYu  https://t.co/BCKLmyQ5wR
1263619992815370242 2020-05-21 16:57:37 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We will soon cross the awful threshold of 100,000 Americans lost to the coronavirus.  Flying the flags at half staff, as @SenSchumer &amp; I proposed in our letter to the President this morning, is an important show of national grief.   Let us honor their memory &amp; act to save lives.
1263612527793053697 2020-05-21 16:27:58 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Make no mistake: voting at home is not only a matter of protecting our democracy – it’s also a question of protecting Americans’ health. #HeroesAct #LastWord  https://t.co/m3r6lDgRdq
1263608970515746817 2020-05-21 16:13:49 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Women were not *given* the right to vote.  They won it for themselves through sheer force of will.  Generations of women &amp; girls fought to be heard.  Today, we honor their leadership as we mark 101 years since the House passed the 19th Amendment.
1263553766898438145 2020-05-21 12:34:28 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Beijing’s announcement of yet another attempt to bring an end to the “one country, two systems” framework in #HongKong is deeply alarming. Attempting to circumvent the HK legislature shows a complete disrespect for the rule of law.
1263528943879180294 2020-05-21 10:55:50 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We cannot allow the President to distract us from our duty to deliver crucial support for American families and frontline workers. #HeroesAct #LastWord  https://t.co/LL5G2Db8L3
1263487053746057216 2020-05-21 08:09:22 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Ensuring Americans are able to vote at home is a crucial step in protecting the health of people in communities across the country. We have a responsibility to ensure our democratic elections do not become a casualty of this crisis. #HeroesAct  https://t.co/v7t4LafEkb
1263483075159261186 2020-05-21 07:53:34 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> 101 years after the House passed the 19th Amendment, @RepSarbanes and Congresswoman @EleanorNorton join me to highlight the crucial vote-by-mail and election security provisions of The #HeroesAct.  Tune in at 11 am ET:  https://t.co/rFd2fqW3Qv
1263262121514672128 2020-05-20 17:15:34 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Justice Department’s continued delay is part of a pattern of the Administration hiding the truth from the public. The American people deserve the truth.
1263262120508096518 2020-05-20 17:15:34 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The House’s long-standing right to obtain grand jury information pursuant to the House’s impeachment power has now been upheld by the lower courts twice. These rulings are supported by decades of precedent and should be permitted to proceed.
1263191151890386944 2020-05-20 12:33:34 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Read my full statement here:  https://t.co/aFWDwHyRco
1263191150728564740 2020-05-20 12:33:33 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Instead of holding a vote on The #HeroesAct, Senate Republicans are engaging in a clear act of political retribution designed to help the President keep his job.  The Senate must stop playing along with the President’s dangerous tactics &amp; take steps to save lives and livelihoods.
1263122510490537990 2020-05-20 08:00:48 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Join me now as I discuss @HouseDemocrats’ work passing the #HeroesAct to provide Americans the strong, urgent relief they need during this pandemic.  https://t.co/jZCbBLPSKo
1263114796746133504 2020-05-20 07:30:09 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, I will be taking questions from reporters live at 10:45 am ET. Tune in here:  https://t.co/2fi357l3G3
1262872778832781313 2020-05-19 15:28:28 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We still do not know the full scale of the tragedy gripping our nation. That is why testing &amp; tracing are at the core of The #HeroesAct. The Senate must pass this legislation to ensure we have the information needed to fight back against COVID-19. #FamiliesFirst #DeadlineWH  https://t.co/uhUd8PE7Bp
1262837196584869888 2020-05-19 13:07:04 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Proud to send @RepSusieLee’s bipartisan resolution to the President’s desk and protect tens of thousands of defrauded students, many of whom are hurting now more than ever, by blocking Devos’s harmful student borrower defense rule. @realDonaldTrump must sign it without delay.  https://t.co/nTptfApZr6
1262758583847907337 2020-05-19 07:54:41 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Tune in as we hold a ceremonial swearing-in for Representatives-elect Tom Tiffany of Wisconsin and Mike Garcia of California.   https://t.co/wtRo456VXv
1262568667411361792 2020-05-18 19:20:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President’s pattern of dismissing Inspectors General is unhealthy for our democracy. @AC360  https://t.co/hJz5mCEMKA
1262488039781208064 2020-05-18 13:59:39 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> News reports that the President may have fired the State Dept IG in response to him nearing completion of an investigation into the approval of billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia are deeply concerning. The President must provide justification for the IG’s removal.  https://t.co/E4c6kaU74Q
1262460515076526083 2020-05-18 12:10:16 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Wishing all the best to the @UCSF Class of 2020 today. Take pride in what you and your classmates have achieved – and know that the entire San Francisco community does as well. We’re all celebrating with you! #UCSFgrads
1262195540504215553 2020-05-17 18:37:21 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Read my full statement here:  https://t.co/8KrjsTcNU9
1262195539296358403 2020-05-17 18:37:21 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> As we mark #IDAHOTB, we also mark one year since the House passed the #EqualityAct to bring our nation closer to achieving liberty &amp; justice for all. Even as Leader McConnell has ignored this legislation, we refuse to back down from the fight for equality for all LGBTQ people.  https://t.co/Wy4EAuuHGQ
1262114927839342592 2020-05-17 13:17:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Inspectors General are at the core of the fight to stop waste, fraud &amp; abuse in our government. The President’s pattern of retaliation against these committed public servants is disgraceful &amp; may be unlawful. @FaceTheNation  https://t.co/Ei1gtoR4x5
1262074436062085120 2020-05-17 10:36:08 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Testing. Treatment. Isolation.  Science shows us that is the path to overcoming this virus.  And it is that plan which is at the heart of the #HeroesAct.  The Senate must take up this crucial legislation immediately. #FamiliesFirst @FaceTheNation  https://t.co/9tS0M4b3EK
1262055966947721217 2020-05-17 09:22:45 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Congratulations to the @smithcollege Class of 2020 as you start the next chapter of your journey! At Smith, you have made history &amp; you have made progress. We all look forward to seeing what your futures hold.  https://t.co/sQpLDgBAVF
1261825747288760327 2020-05-16 18:07:56 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> It’s inspiring to see how members of the @smithcollege community are coming together to honor the Class of 2020 with #SmithIlluminates. Thank you for the opportunity to join the celebration of their achievement during tomorrow’s virtual Commencement ceremony.
1261491103414595587 2020-05-15 19:58:11 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The late-night, weekend firing of State Department IG Steve Linick is an acceleration of the President’s dangerous pattern of retaliation against the patriotic public servants charged with conducting oversight on behalf of the American people.  https://t.co/VavmuJpX25
1261433224594513920 2020-05-15 16:08:11 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> .@RepDebHaaland knows: a vote for the #HeroesAct is a vote for all of our families and all of our essential workers. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/ec2gDb6rDH
1261370238186057728 2020-05-15 11:57:54 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> SNAP has been the cornerstone in the fight against hunger and poverty for decades.   Now, it is an essential part of the fight against the coronavirus. Democrats are committed to standing with our fellow Americans against food insecurity. #HandsOffSNAP #HeroesAct  https://t.co/pSpJZIcEJf
1261114717109719040 2020-05-14 19:02:33 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Too much is at stake. Lives are on the line. We need a monumental bill that provides the relief our nation desperately needs.    We must pass the #HeroesAct so we may protect the livelihoods of the American people  https://t.co/zED3uUXkbk
1261088569952788480 2020-05-14 17:18:39 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> See how your state and your community benefit from investments in state and local governments under this legislation:  https://t.co/hfguprQ34B
1261088568828665863 2020-05-14 17:18:39 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Tomorrow, the House will vote on the #HeroesAct to pay tribute to our frontline workers, make the investments needed to reopen our economy and put money in the pockets of America’s hard-working families.
1261013619103408129 2020-05-14 12:20:49 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Join me now as I answer questions about the #HeroesAct: urgently-needed legislation to protect the lives and livelihoods of the American people and the life of our democracy.   https://t.co/NnvB57PNno
1261003469361643523 2020-05-14 11:40:30 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> I will be speaking with reporters live at the U.S. Capitol today at 3:00 pm ET.  https://t.co/2fi357l3G3
1260699277707415553 2020-05-13 15:31:45 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> This moment in our nation’s history calls for humanity, science &amp; the family of America caring for each other. #HeroesAct @Morning_Joe  https://t.co/9ZiavB6nFi
1260666316266115074 2020-05-13 13:20:46 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The coronavirus is the greatest disaster that our country has ever faced. We must do what is necessary to deal with this crisis and get the country back to work safely. The American people are worth it. #HeroesAct #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/H7xDqXoTFv
1260376812103892993 2020-05-12 18:10:23 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The pillars of the #HeroesAct are based on the bipartisan bills already passed by the Congress to combat the coronavirus. We must continue to put #FamiliesFirst.  https://t.co/qV9KCgixxD
1260360004256911363 2020-05-12 17:03:36 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The #HeroesAct is based on a simple premise: that it’s not enough just to expand testing, tracing and treatment. We must ensure all Americans have access. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/qhCbXeqUjs
1260284334411579395 2020-05-12 12:02:54 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, @HouseDemocrats introduced the #HeroesAct, bold legislation to address the COVID-19 health and economic crisis.  https://t.co/K2Pz9FR0Vu
1260275578944487427 2020-05-12 11:28:07 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> I will be making a statement from the U.S. Capitol this afternoon on the introduction of the #HeroesAct.  Tune in at 3 pm ET:  https://t.co/rFd2fqW3Qv
1259647243797368833 2020-05-10 17:51:20 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Republicans have stood in the way of expanding SNAP benefits in the last three coronavirus relief bills. As mothers report that 1 in 5 children do not have enough to eat, we must work together to expand our support for our most vulnerable. #FamiliesFirst @FCPwithGreta  https://t.co/zulFQ6doii
1259595056564047876 2020-05-10 14:23:58 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The sooner we identify the scale of the problem, the sooner we can open our economy. We must expand testing without delay. #FamiliesFirst @FCPwithGreta  https://t.co/VciVAsWjWt
1259520224770088960 2020-05-10 09:26:36 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Whether or not we are blessed to have our mothers with us, we carry them in our hearts ever day. #MothersDay  https://t.co/ZQlWApak0z
1259484076421111809 2020-05-10 07:02:58 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Wishing you all a Happy #MothersDay!  https://t.co/psrUfUqCTh
1258834307206057984 2020-05-08 12:01:01 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Our nation was forever changed by the sacrifice and heroism shown by the men and women who served during World War II. We remain forever in their debt. #VEDay75
1258807316876595201 2020-05-08 10:13:46 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The dire job losses in the record-shattering April jobs report show the urgent need for a bold #CARES2 package that is equal to the crisis gripping the American people. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/WO2KMZIbwh
1258496992847814659 2020-05-07 13:40:39 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> There are certain things that are urgent. Republicans’ hope for a capital gains tax cut for the wealthiest Americans – when nearly one-fifth of mothers with young children say their kids are not getting enough to eat – is not one of them. #FamiliesFirst @BloombergTV  https://t.co/PTs7ShlmvH
1258479073950601221 2020-05-07 12:29:27 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Sickened by the unjust killing of yet another black man in our country.   #AhmaudArbery’s life mattered. As we mourn his death, we owe it to his family, his loved ones and his memory to ensure justice is served without further delay.
1258408551485181952 2020-05-07 07:49:13 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Tune in as I hold my weekly press conference at the U.S. Capitol.  https://t.co/WaSuci5GVz
1258395897148215297 2020-05-07 06:58:56 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> I’ll be speaking with reporters live at 10:45 am ET today about the ongoing efforts to put workers and families first as America faces this public health crisis.  Tune in here:  https://t.co/rFd2frdEI3
1258139653431013377 2020-05-06 14:00:43 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> What we must do – what science tells us we must do – is focus on expanding testing &amp; contact tracing. That is the only way we can safely reopen our economy. #AMR #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/ijp4fAAcxM
1258052709518843905 2020-05-06 08:15:14 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Trump Administration must not take away health care from tens of millions of Americans in the middle of a pandemic. The President should end his lawsuit seeking to dismantle the ACA and the crucial pre-existing condition protections it includes.  https://t.co/cPY2S8B0bG
1257816307472490502 2020-05-05 16:35:51 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Congress cannot allow their reward for this inspiring show of expertise to be a furlough or a pink slip. The best way to #ThankATeacher is to ensure they and countless other workers in our communities have the support they need to continue their vital work. RT if you agree!
1257816306549575680 2020-05-05 16:35:51 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Over the last two months, teachers nationwide have achieved the impossible: rewriting lesson plans in a matter of hours, rapidly mastering new technology, and devising innovative ways to keep America’s students engaged at a distance.
1257816305513779206 2020-05-05 16:35:50 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> As far as I’m concerned, every day should be #TeacherAppreciationDay. Their miraculous work is invaluable and their impact on our children unmistakable – even without a national crisis complicating their efforts.
1257811041704202242 2020-05-05 16:14:55 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Sad news. My mother and I both went to IND. My brother Tommy was a longtime board member. Its creed – Pro Deo et Patria – is enshrined in our hearts.
1257806788491186178 2020-05-05 15:58:01 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Science is our key to unlocking our country. The last thing we need is political interference into science. #FamiliesFirst

1257797299834667008 2020-05-05 15:20:19 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, we honor the contributions and rich heritage of Mexican Americans &amp; the entire Latino community – and remind ourselves of our responsibility to ensure that every family, regardless of status or national origin, receives the care and relief that they deserve. #CincoDeMayo  https://t.co/jY1pI4TZFn
1257684468996980736 2020-05-05 07:51:58 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, we welcome Congressman-elect Kweisi Mfume of Maryland to the People’s House.  https://t.co/kmxuxZi7RT
1257673467186614274 2020-05-05 07:08:15 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Tune in at 10:45 am ET for the ceremonial swearing-in for Congressman-elect Kweisi Mfume of Maryland.  https://t.co/zU3Pjl0oUv
1257465380051746816 2020-05-04 17:21:23 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The White House is blocking key officials from testifying to Congress about the response to the coronavirus crisis. This is just the latest sign of Trump’s efforts to keep the truth from the American people. #SitRoom  https://t.co/XDdTCMKEkv
1256339927555399680 2020-05-01 14:49:15 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Generations of Asian Americans and Pacific Islander communities have contributed their energy, creativity, diversity and patriotism to enrich our communities. This #AAPIHeritageMonth, we honor their contributions and our heritage as a nation of immigrants.  https://t.co/HyA5E2mtw5  https://t.co/SLNK177D9i
1256329080116477953 2020-05-01 14:06:08 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> In communities across the country, families &amp; students are more reliant on access to broadband internet than ever before. Thank you to @WhipClyburn for leading the fight to expand this essential service nationwide. #ForThePeople #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/dbmp1HXxkP
1256279801666682881 2020-05-01 10:50:19 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> As we celebrate this Jewish American Heritage Month, we honor the diversity of our communities and the vital contributions Jewish Americans have made to the beautiful fabric of our nation.  https://t.co/i2kg2guqgy  https://t.co/h4pF8x5MTC
1255943127887642624 2020-04-30 12:32:30 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Where there’s money, there’s mischief. Congress will not back away from our responsibility to ensure the resources we have made available are being used properly as our nation confronts this public health crisis. #FamiliesFirst @NewDay  https://t.co/PJ3GonMRQY
1255925037745475584 2020-04-30 11:20:37 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We must do everything in our power to create a path to reopening our economy – one which must include a significant expansion in testing nationwide. #FamiliesFirst @NewDay  https://t.co/Bsmpafoo70
1255874179154485249 2020-04-30 07:58:31 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Tune in as I discuss the ongoing efforts to protect American lives, livelihoods, and the life of our democracy. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/vNkThb00hx

1255657882852392960 2020-04-29 17:39:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> All the praise in the world is meaningless if we don’t take steps to ensure our police, fire, and EMS are able to safely fight this public health crisis. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/dQkgSgDpKS
1255625041125036032 2020-04-29 15:28:32 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The American people have made it clear: we must maintain social distancing as we work to protect American lives, livelihoods, and the life of our democracy. @SquawkStreet #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/7eVfHwKUWi

1254885362641575937 2020-04-27 14:29:19 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Trump Administration must not interfere with Executive Director Westbrooks‘ independence in his critical role leading the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee created in the #CARESAct.  https://t.co/sebzf3K6wJ
1254823277899526144 2020-04-27 10:22:37 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Supporting our health care workers, hospitals and testing initiatives are not “extracurricular.” #FamiliesFirst #MSNBCLive  https://t.co/0cl198XaFO
1254802256840589313 2020-04-27 08:59:05 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> It takes immense courage &amp; optimism to start a small business. We need to make sure they have access to the resources they need during these tough times. #FamiliesFirst #MSNBCLive  https://t.co/EuJF6OTVrR
1254549723328983042 2020-04-26 16:15:37 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Our women, veteran, rural &amp; minority-owned small businesses in America’s underserved and coronavirus-affected communities deserve equal treatment. These job-creating entrepreneurs must not be forced to face unfair barriers to access PPP loans.  https://t.co/5eQ80EvzX0
1254549721953296384 2020-04-26 16:15:36 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Trump Admin must do much more to prevent well-connected corporations from crowding out the truly small businesses on Main Street that need PPP assistance the most. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/pzCx7gQ0Kr
1254504253290434567 2020-04-26 13:14:56 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Our response to this pandemic must be aimed at protecting American lives, American livelihoods, and the life of our democracy. #FamiliesFirst #AMJoy  https://t.co/G5QZUmbdvu
1254479859289595906 2020-04-26 11:38:00 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Unlike the President, House &amp; Senate Democrats are committed to making decisions guided by science, data, evidence, and truth. #FamiliesFirst #AMJoy  https://t.co/72Jg6zhg0R
1254456270947483648 2020-04-26 10:04:16 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President’s words have weight. We must insist on the truth. #AMJoy  https://t.co/ukXTYcI2nk
1254430583540809729 2020-04-26 08:22:11 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Congressional Democrats are fighting to put #FamiliesFirst – and those values will guide us as we move forward. #CNNSOTU  https://t.co/x2iwMXMlYi

1253799158391201793 2020-04-24 14:33:08 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The situation we are in today is a result of Republicans’ rejection of science and their duty to govern. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/mnzKmfdAvg

1253659734324006914 2020-04-24 05:19:07 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President must not ignore the facts on the ground.   Only a focused, whole-of-government response will bring an end to this coronavirus crisis.   The Trump Admin must deliver a concrete, nationwide strategy to expand testing. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/GGYzrVJgGO
1253476656951549952 2020-04-23 17:11:38 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> As Muslim families across America &amp; around the world mark the start of #Ramadan, we join our Muslim friends &amp; neighbors to pray for the well-being of our communities and a year ahead filled with the blessings of health, happiness &amp; family.  https://t.co/TXi8UmUllQ  https://t.co/lVIGRflUlw

With my signature, this legislation goes to the President’s desk.  https://t.co/24hgdwKX1E
1253449374580932609 2020-04-23 15:23:13 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Moments ago, the House passed urgently-needed assistance to fight this coronavirus &amp; save lives. With my signature, the interim coronavirus relief package goes to the President’s desk. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/PPCaTcnwOc
1253398000694636546 2020-04-23 11:59:05 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The lives and livelihoods of Americans across the nation depend on our country taking a science-based approach to confronting this pandemic. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/KJv3DkTaCa
1253062418588151812 2020-04-22 13:45:36 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> This #EarthDay, House Democrats stand with people around the world calling for thoughtful, science-based leadership that puts the health and well-being of our families first.  https://t.co/14uZJyOZ60  https://t.co/IIwXneltnp
1252983666516598784 2020-04-22 08:32:40 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President was not properly prepared for this crisis – and it cost lives. @Morning_Joe  https://t.co/ejGcucnF0A
1252968496490831872 2020-04-22 07:32:23 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The legislation passed yesterday by the Senate – and which will pass the House tomorrow – includes crucial improvements to the Paycheck Protection Program which ensure more small businesses are able to access the resources they need. #FamiliesFirst @Morning_Joe  https://t.co/mRQgBkzm06
1252698046380548104 2020-04-21 13:37:42 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Congressional Democrats are proud to have secured an agreement on an interim emergency funding package that has been transformed to provide real support for the lives &amp; livelihoods of the American people. #FamiliesFirst  Read my statement with @SenSchumer:  https://t.co/7UjlRsmRK7
1252596260994981891 2020-04-21 06:53:15 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Governors across the country have been champions for the American people. We must work to ensure they have the resources needed to expand testing. #FamiliesFirst @AC360  https://t.co/FoPpZjWYHS
1252427829511258119 2020-04-20 19:43:58 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We must take steps to ensure that all who need to can participate in the Paycheck Protection Program. #FamiliesFirst @AC360  https://t.co/FWjIGxs8tx
1251989992324435968 2020-04-19 14:44:09 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> .@HouseDemocrats are committed to fixing the flaws in the Paycheck Protection Program that have kept too many small businesses from gaining access. #FamiliesFirst @ThisWeekABC  https://t.co/hBS5hg2N95
1251976565258321920 2020-04-19 13:50:48 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Leaders take responsibility. The President must stop attempting to shift blame and start making the science-based decisions we need to confront this crisis. #FamiliesFirst #FNS  https://t.co/h06ZnT4vG7
1251959584119574529 2020-04-19 12:43:19 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The coronavirus is not a hoax. It will not magically disappear. Our effort to fight it — and to reopen our economy — must be based in science, data, and facts. #FamiliesFirst @ThisWeekABC  https://t.co/ae2K3Es3L4
1251949799693258752 2020-04-19 12:04:27 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Testing is the key to opening our economy. The truth is the Administration has failed on testing. We need to acknowledge that fact and move forward. #FamiliesFirst @ThisWeekABC  https://t.co/s04GfMl5Ux
1251932012421791746 2020-04-19 10:53:46 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We are committed to ensuring small businesses across America have access to the resources they need as we continue the fight against the coronavirus. #FamiliesFirst #FNS  https://t.co/ViTXvxe5nl
1251634951814107138 2020-04-18 15:13:21 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Delay and denial cost lives. Our national response must be driven by science, data, evidence and facts. #FamiliesFirst @TheBeatWithAri  https://t.co/StI8DX03zN
1251614957730443266 2020-04-18 13:53:54 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> As Orthodox Christians across America and around the world receive the Light during this unprecedented time, I wish you all a Happy Easter.
1251581390271008768 2020-04-18 11:40:31 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Even as the world confronts the coronavirus crisis, democracy and human rights continue to be attacked in Hong Kong. @RepMcGovern is right — @realDonaldTrump must swiftly begin implementing the Hong Kong Human Rights &amp; Democracy Act.
1251573251614150660 2020-04-18 11:08:10 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Testing, testing, testing.   Only by expanding testing can we open the door to rebuilding our economy. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/mLcSlwpFw7
1251553429815791621 2020-04-18 09:49:25 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Providing for frontline workers and small businesses in communities across the country is essential to achieving our goal of protecting the lives and livelihoods of hardworking American families. #FamiliesFirst @TheBeatWithAri  https://t.co/pZjnrRQb5M
1251260670131265537 2020-04-17 14:26:05 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Chairman @BennieGThompson and @HouseDemocrats understand the key to succeeding in this crisis is working together &amp; using the truth as our guide. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/mtdUEKDBYn
1250845530365800448 2020-04-16 10:56:28 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> To say “People will die, so be it” instead of a science &amp; testing-based path to reopening the economy is deeply frivolous &amp; wrong.  Every life is precious. Each death is heartbreaking — for a family &amp; for a community. This is something we are all in together. #FamiliesFirst
1250819453048303618 2020-04-16 09:12:51 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> I will be speaking with reporters at 12:15 pm ET as House Democrats continue our work #ForThePeople.  Listen in here:  https://t.co/GmhqvppRne
1250470480068456451 2020-04-15 10:06:09 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Delaying direct payments to vulnerable families just to print his name on the check is another shameful example of President Trump’s catastrophic failure to treat this crisis with the urgency it demands.
1250448741905174528 2020-04-15 08:39:46 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Paycheck Protection Program is a crucial tool for protecting workers across the country – yet serious flaws are keeping far too many small businesses from receiving the resources they need. The @SenateGOP must stop blocking commonsense solutions that put #FamiliesFirst.
1250243450865356801 2020-04-14 19:04:01 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> There are important decisions ahead. Making the right choices requires understanding the truth of what took place &amp; of what is currently happening.  https://t.co/04xiriNmrZ
1250243450085277697 2020-04-14 19:04:01 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The truth is a weak person, a poor leader, takes no responsibility. A weak person blames others.
1250243449128976386 2020-04-14 19:04:01 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The truth is because of an incompetent reaction to this health crisis, the strong economy handed to Donald Trump is now a disaster, causing the suffering of countless Americans and endangering lives.
1250243448151703555 2020-04-14 19:04:01 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The truth is that we did not have proper testing available in March despite Trump repeatedly claiming that we did; and even now, we do not have adequate tests, masks, PPE, and necessary equipment, which creates unnecessary death and suffering.
1250243447186960386 2020-04-14 19:04:00 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The truth is that Donald Trump told his most loyal followers that the pandemic was a hoax and that it would magically disappear, thus endangering lives and paving the way for economic disaster.
1250243446096437249 2020-04-14 19:04:00 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The truth is that in January Donald Trump was warned about this pandemic, ignored those warnings, took insufficient action and caused unnecessary death and disaster.
1250243445047861249 2020-04-14 19:04:00 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Now more than ever, we need the truth. And the truth is that Donald Trump dismantled the infrastructure handed to him which was meant to plan for and overcome a pandemic, resulting in unnecessary deaths and economic disaster.
1250147351576150017 2020-04-14 12:42:09 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> I understand the instincts of scientists who don’t want to appear political. But make no mistake: the decision not to speak is a political decision. #FamiliesFirst #LateLateShow  https://t.co/jXCvUJN1Bn
1250100801588080641 2020-04-14 09:37:11 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Administration needs to prioritize understanding who is most at risk during this crisis. Only then can we make the data-driven decisions that will allow us to fight &amp; defeat this coronavirus. #FamiliesFirst #LateLateShow  https://t.co/eNtrMT5ezx
1250080704446238725 2020-04-14 08:17:19 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We all have found our ways to keep our spirits up during these trying times. Mine just happens to fill up my freezer. #LateLateShow  https://t.co/dqA32d5lU1
1249726058250809346 2020-04-13 08:48:05 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Grocery, pharmacy &amp; food processing workers are doing their part to be sure families have what they need!  Say thank you by being sure to #ShopSmart:  1) Wear a mask inside the store 2) Keep 6+ ft between yourself &amp; others 3) Properly dispose of gloves  #SaveLives
1249700320571265026 2020-04-13 07:05:49 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Small businesses, hospitals, frontline workers and state &amp; local governments across America are struggling to keep up with this crisis. They need more help from the federal government &amp; they need it fast. #FamiliesFirst  Read my statement with @SenSchumer:  https://t.co/L6u2FPVyKh
1249360939092193281 2020-04-12 08:37:14 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Wishing you all a #HappyEaster!  https://t.co/CbpSRwMjDY
1249006058019999744 2020-04-11 09:07:04 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> On a bipartisan basis, governors are crying out for help and Congress must act. Democrats will continue to push for urgently needed funds for state and local governments in the interim emergency bill and #CARES2. #FamiliesFirst
1249006056237342721 2020-04-11 09:07:03 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Our state and local governments are in crisis, and between emergency expenses and rising unemployment sapping revenue, they need an immediate infusion of funds to prevent the collapse of essential services.
1248682925211750400 2020-04-10 11:43:03 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> So much has changed in the 37 days since we came together to honor you during Women’s History Month, @DoloresHuerta. Yet as we mark your birthday today, we take strength from your decades-long example of fighting for working families across the country. ¡Si, se puede!  https://t.co/Pr9ME90ZIl
1248673114059350017 2020-04-10 11:04:04 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Congress cannot ignore the issues that have emerged in the Small Business Administration’s relief programs. Main Street small businesses in underbanked or rural communities must not be left behind by the Paycheck Protection Program. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/TAWuRIlLkO
1248590183819329538 2020-04-10 05:34:32 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> I was heartbroken to learn of the passing of Phyllis Lyon: an icon of San Francisco and an LGBTQ rights trailblazer who used her voice to fight for justice and hold our nation accountable to its Founding values.  https://t.co/izTQdY9vGF  https://t.co/sWJ745dZT4
1248416105426644992 2020-04-09 18:02:48 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Hospitals and our state &amp; local governments are carrying much of the burden of fighting the coronavirus. We must make sure they have the resources they need to succeed. @MadMoneyOnCNBC #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/G1vxB51GeW
1248399484855312395 2020-04-09 16:56:45 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Testing is the key to reopening our economy. We must have a clear picture of just how the coronavirus is affecting our communities. @MadMoneyOnCNBC #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/gj5vXDIlJl
1248394387467296769 2020-04-09 16:36:30 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Reports of abuse and neglect inflicted by U.S. immigration agents on a pregnant Guatemalan woman in labor during asylum processing are deeply concerning. @DHSOIG must immediately begin an investigation into this unacceptable behavior.  https://t.co/e5i6m5YZWN

1247995323072610309 2020-04-08 14:10:46 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> 30 years after his death, Ryan White’s courageous legacy remains an inspiration to all fighting to relegate HIV/AIDS to the history books and ensure all people living with HIV are able to live full lives free from discrimination.
1247955972510842880 2020-04-08 11:34:24 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> No American should be forced to choose between staying healthy and exercising their right to vote. @cnnnewsroom #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/YQj1zLlVGa
1247614962605928453 2020-04-07 12:59:21 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The sudden removal &amp; replacement of Acting IG Glenn Fine is part of a disturbing pattern of retaliation by the President against independent overseers fulfilling their duties to conduct oversight on behalf of the American people.  https://t.co/4QmyMdJ1S9
1247362447293415425 2020-04-06 20:15:56 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Congress has taken decisive action to respond to the coronavirus – but there is still more to do to protect the health and financial security of America’s families. #TRMS #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/GDeMOHcYHP
1246440243324207105 2020-04-04 07:11:26 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The late-night firing of Inspector General Atkinson is a brazen act against a patriotic public servant who has honorably performed his duty to protect the Constitution and our national security, as required by the law and by his oath.  https://t.co/MzFFY9xPgT
1246203557772230659 2020-04-03 15:30:56 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Vote-by-mail is essential to protecting the future of our democracy as we confront this public health crisis. There is no legitimate argument against enacting it. #LSSC  https://t.co/WPgOgIivK0
1246192803316740096 2020-04-03 14:48:12 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We’re up to about 90% of Americans being under shelter-in-place orders. It should be 100 percent. #FamiliesFirst #LSSC  https://t.co/vCibvjoUJw
1246179979093782528 2020-04-03 13:57:14 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Chairwoman @NitaLowey is an invaluable leader in the fight to put #FamiliesFirst during this crisis. Her message is clear: by working together, Americans can save lives and set the stage for a strong recovery.  https://t.co/ZsqoEBXlb9
1246122597919711232 2020-04-03 10:09:13 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The coronavirus is moving swiftly, and our communities cannot afford for us to wait.

1246104596017225732 2020-04-03 08:57:41 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> History shows us that proper, timely Congressional oversight not only saves money – it saves lives. #FamiliesFirst #LSSC  https://t.co/Mzj0Ic2f4F
1246078761419837441 2020-04-03 07:15:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Our work goes on to ensure that the #CARESAct is properly implemented and to prepare for the next phase of our #FamiliesFirst agenda. #LSSC  https://t.co/UdJonNstXR
1245882912123375627 2020-04-02 18:16:48 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Either the Administration didn’t know how to respond to the coming crisis, or they refused to accept the threat that it posed. Anything else is just an excuse. #AMR  https://t.co/qmTMSVKy67
1245856515208228865 2020-04-02 16:31:54 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We need to be doing more to ensure Americans have the health care they need. Instead, the President is continuing his mission to steal coverage from millions &amp; tear protections away from the more than 130 million Americans living with pre-existing conditions. #AMR #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/ragUalVgHP
1245834448844787713 2020-04-02 15:04:13 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The House will not walk away from its duty to ensure that the resources provided through our #FamiliesFirst legislative packages are used wisely &amp; effectively. #AMR  https://t.co/VMiUDJ97TQ
1245819579084963840 2020-04-02 14:05:08 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We have no right to even pay respects to frontline medical workers if we can’t get them the equipment they need to stay safe and save lives. President Trump must use the full power of the Defense Production Act to meet their needs. #AMR #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/3TyQWEGgC8
1245768253487661056 2020-04-02 10:41:11 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Led by @WhipClyburn, the Select Committee will root out waste, fraud, and abuse, and ensure money makes it to those who need it most – the working families struggling to pay rent and put food on the table. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/mlqwIZdA9O
1245768251956760582 2020-04-02 10:41:11 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Congress has so far passed three pieces of legislation totaling over $2 trillion in emergency relief. To ensure that your tax dollars are being spent carefully &amp; effectively, I am announcing the formation of the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Coronavirus Crisis.
1245763471582679040 2020-04-02 10:22:11 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> With Native communities across the United States at risk, @HouseDemocrats are working to protect lives in Indian Country – ensuring tribes and @IHSgov have the resources needed to stop the spread of the coronavirus and save lives. #CoronavirusIndianCountry

1245027162467508230 2020-03-31 09:36:21 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump must immediately implement the Defense Production Act. American lives depend on quickly &amp; efficiently delivering personal protective equipment and ventilators to communities across the country. #FamiliesFirst  https://t.co/0VwE6lpAhQ

1244774652179886080 2020-03-30 16:52:58 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> While the President has made clear he will ignore oversight provisions in the #CARESAct, Acting IG Fine must exercise his full oversight authority to ensure that the Admin uses this relief package to help workers, not to pad the pockets of corporations &amp; the wealthiest few.
1244734490444017664 2020-03-30 14:13:23 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Ten years ago, Democrats made the single largest investment in student aid in U.S. history with the Student Aid &amp; Fiscal Responsibility Act. Last week, we secured student borrower relief in the CARES Act &amp; will prioritize student debt throughout this crisis. #FamiliesFirst
1244339556058611715 2020-03-29 12:04:03 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We cannot deny the facts on the ground. We owe it to those working to save lives to quickly ramp up testing and deliver personal protective equipment. #FamiliesFirst #CNNSOTU  https://t.co/Etr4Nk402b
1244295869152854018 2020-03-29 09:10:27 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The #CARESAct was just a down payment in the fight against the coronavirus. We can and will do more to help state &amp; local governments as they fight this public health crisis. #FamiliesFirst #CNNSOTU  https://t.co/nybwe0EtWR
1244091443007889408 2020-03-28 19:38:08 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> I will be joining CNN’s @jaketapper at 9 am ET on Sunday to discuss the ongoing efforts to fight the coronavirus in communities across the country. #CNNSOTU  https://t.co/cJWP4EOe1U
1244034462373023748 2020-03-28 15:51:43 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The #CARESAct is nothing short of an act of legislative jujitsu.

The House has voted to allow HHS to negotiate for #LowerDrugCosts.  How long do families have to wait for @SenateMajLdr to do the same?  https://t.co/qScOQFvooA
1234517079757332483 2020-03-02 08:33:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The ACA is a pillar of health &amp; economic security for American families — and even more critical during an epidemic. But in the middle of the #coronavirus crisis, the Trump Admin continues to ask the courts to tear health coverage away from millions.  https://t.co/716kuxwC94
1234265875387179008 2020-03-01 15:54:50 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Cautiously optimistic about U.S.-Taliban agreement for conditions-based troop drawdown. Many significant additional steps remain to achieve comprehensive and enduring peace. Afghan women must be at the negotiating table; their voices must be heard.  https://t.co/nG5TNynXWF
1234155742095183872 2020-03-01 08:37:13 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> #WomensHistoryMonth reminds us that when women succeed, America succeeds.  https://t.co/a8dhFJkjKb  https://t.co/BkD7A7blsc
1233852534235770882 2020-02-29 12:32:22 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Congress is taking steps to ensure the government has access to the resources needed to combat this deadly virus &amp; keep Americans safe. House appropriators are working hard on a funding package which we hope to vote on next week.
1233852533375938561 2020-02-29 12:32:22 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Sadly and prayerfully, today, we learned of the first death from the #coronavirus in the United States. The American people expect a well-coordinated, fully-funded response that appropriately addresses this public health crisis.
1233557266990804992 2020-02-28 16:59:05 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Intelligence should never be guided by partisanship or politics. Rep. John Ratcliffe’s embrace of conspiracy theories and distrust of law enforcement &amp; intelligence patriots disqualify him from leading America’s intel community.  https://t.co/8vQeOlSD94
1233459146630008833 2020-02-28 10:29:11 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The mother of the civil rights movement, Dorothy Height dedicated her life to the pursuit of justice for all, fighting tirelessly to turn the tides of history towards progress. #BlackHistoryMonth  https://t.co/Bi4cczphQF
1233432448249278469 2020-02-28 08:43:06 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Whenever people ask for the three most important issues in our country, I tell them the same thing:  -The children -The children -The children  We must do all we can to help young Americans achieve their full potential. Today, we do that by confronting the youth tobacco epidemic.  https://t.co/nuYTKuMxmf
1233395187239571457 2020-02-28 06:15:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, the House takes up legislation to combat the youth tobacco epidemic. Tune in as House Democrats discuss H.R. 2339, the Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act.  https://t.co/ArfXuAlQbU
1233138347415154713 2020-02-27 13:14:27 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Chairman Elijah E. Cummings was our North Star. He led the @OversightDems with character &amp; integrity, and his legacy of principled leadership will stand for years to come. Today, @RepMaloney &amp; I dedicate the Oversight and Reform Hearing Room in his honor.  https://t.co/fAixKb2cdD

1233117203530211328 2020-02-27 11:50:26 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> One year after the House passed bipartisan background checks legislation, we have a simple question for @SenateMajLdr McConnell:  Why do you think your political survival is more important than the survival of America’s children?  #EndGunViolence  https://t.co/NLMAIVdfAb
1233105779680587776 2020-02-27 11:05:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today marks 365 days since the House passed bipartisan background checks legislation – and still Leader McConnell refuses to take action.   Enough is enough. Tune in as Democrats come together to demand a vote to #EndGunViolence.  https://t.co/C7a1So8eKl
1233092776578998278 2020-02-27 10:13:22 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> One year ago, the House passed bipartisan background checks legislation to #EndGunViolence.  At 2 pm ET, House &amp; Senate Democrats will come together to call on Leader McConnell to finally bring a vote on this effort to save lives.  Watch here:   https://t.co/MoOTAIYG7g
1233062483067310080 2020-02-27 08:12:59 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Any emergency funding supplemental the Congress approves must be entirely new funding – not stolen from other accounts.  Read my full statement with @SenSchumer here:  https://t.co/DxKDrGCe31
1233062482190766081 2020-02-27 08:12:59 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The first step the Congress must make is to ensure the government has the resources needed to combat this deadly #coronavirus and keep Americans safe.
1233062480936685568 2020-02-27 08:12:59 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The U.S. Government must do more to address the spread of #coronavirus in a smart, strategic, and serious way. @SenSchumer &amp; I stand ready to work in a bipartisan fashion in Congress &amp; with the Admin to achieve this goal. This is not the time for name-calling or playing politics.
1233060653658771456 2020-02-27 08:05:43 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Tune in as I speak with reporters live at the U.S. Capitol.  https://t.co/WMkNn8mk95

1232868860237352960 2020-02-26 19:23:36 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Instead of delivering the well-coordinated, fully-funded #coronavirus response Americans deserve, the Trump Admin continues to leave key positions vacant &amp; ransack other vital public health needs.  https://t.co/IlY7sbnMgD

1232796271305469952 2020-02-26 14:35:09 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We are closely following developments surrounding the shooting in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Our prayers are with the families who have lost loved ones and the first responders protecting the community. Congress has a duty to them all to take real action to #EndGunViolence.
1232756727742898176 2020-02-26 11:58:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Racially-motivated acts of terror have long been a part of American history. Today, we confront that violent reality by finally acting to make lynching a hate crime. Thank you to @RepBobbyRush &amp; @RepKarenBass for championing this essential legislation.  https://t.co/ZMRralXwd9
1232472872347521024 2020-02-25 17:10:05 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> In their failed attempt to pass two anti-choice, anti-women bills, Senate Republicans have once again attacked the freedom of women to make their own health decisions in consultation with their families, their physicians &amp; their faith.  https://t.co/Crvg5a8K53
1232437700784877569 2020-02-25 14:50:20 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The House passed the #LowerDrugCosts Now Act to negotiate lower Rx prices for America's seniors &amp; families – but Leader McConnell still refuses to take action.  How many people have to watch their loved ones go without necessary medications before the Senate will vote on #HR3?  https://t.co/BTY7o9fhsg
1232379270783213568 2020-02-25 10:58:09 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> A gifted writer, James Baldwin used the power of his pen to shine a light on the devastating impact of racism in America.  His poignant literature reminds us to exhibit compassion &amp; courage as we fight to achieve a more just society. #BlackHistoryMonth  https://t.co/Pbd6fiziRh
1232171125855178752 2020-02-24 21:11:03 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The House will swiftly advance a strong, strategic funding package that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of this public health crisis.
1232171125070794754 2020-02-24 21:11:03 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Our state and local governments need serious funding to be ready to respond effectively to any outbreak in the U.S. The President should not be raiding money that Congress has appropriated for other life-or-death public health priorities.
1232171124169027584 2020-02-24 21:11:03 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Weeks after the #TrumpBudget called for slashing the CDC budget during this coronavirus epidemic, this undersized funding request shows an ongoing failure to understand urgent public health needs.
1232171123321769990 2020-02-24 21:11:03 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President’s most recent budget called for slashing funding for the Centers for Disease Control, which is on the frontlines of this emergency. And now, he is compounding our vulnerabilities by seeking to ransack funds still needed to keep Ebola in check.
1232171122474528768 2020-02-24 21:11:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> For almost two years, the Trump Administration has left critical positions in charge of managing pandemics at the National Security Council and the Department of Homeland Security vacant.
1232171121459462144 2020-02-24 21:11:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Americans need a coordinated, fully-funded, whole-of-government response to keep them and their loved ones safe. The President’s request for coronavirus response funding is long overdue and completely inadequate to the scale of this emergency.
1232103817715560448 2020-02-24 16:43:36 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> It was a pleasure to try my hand at making fortune cookies at the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory (with a little guidance from owner Kevin Chan, of course).  The message inside?  “United We Stand.”  https://t.co/3piGq4yKXq
1232007214057115648 2020-02-24 10:19:44 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Katherine Johnson pioneered new frontiers for space exploration &amp; shattered barriers of race and gender, inspiring generations of women &amp; girls to reach for the stars.

1231234510743908354 2020-02-22 07:09:17 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Thank you @RepSylviaGarcia &amp; @Port_Houston for the wonderful opportunity to join local Houston business &amp; labor leaders for an engaging discussion on the USMCA and @HouseDemocrats’ bold #MovingForward infrastructure proposal to rebuild America in a green new way.  https://t.co/YqTk3oopv8
1230976399621660672 2020-02-21 14:03:38 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> This week, @RepJohnYarmuth is holding President Trump accountable for the #TrumpBudget proposal that would cut more than a trillion dollars from Medicare &amp; Medicaid, threatening health care for families &amp; seniors across America.  https://t.co/bdb2K1rTv7
1230948079479795712 2020-02-21 12:11:06 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Trump’s FCC repealed #NetNeutrality without considering public safety. Now they’re trying to hide their latest moves. @senatemajldr, give consumers &amp; innovators the net neutrality protections they deserve, and take up the #SavetheNet Act the House passed nearly 300 days ago.
1230904010120540160 2020-02-21 09:15:59 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Wishing my dear friend, the Conscience of the Congress, @RepJohnLewis a very happy birthday!  Every day, your courage inspires us all to fight for freedom, justice and a more perfect union.  https://t.co/rpblTx0oly
1230703877634158592 2020-02-20 20:00:44 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We await the election security briefing for Members on March 10.
1230703876501733377 2020-02-20 20:00:44 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> American voters should decide American elections — not Vladimir Putin. All Members of Congress should condemn the President’s reported efforts to dismiss threats to the integrity of our democracy &amp; to politicize our intel community.  https://t.co/uiAU2lXwrs
1230620567444873218 2020-02-20 14:29:41 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Looking forward to joining you all to celebrate in a few short months, @smithcollege! #Smith2020
1230569076319248384 2020-02-20 11:05:05 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump has once again put his political interests ahead of America’s national security interests by appointing an Acting Director of National Intelligence whose sole qualification is his absolute loyalty to the President.  https://t.co/EZpWYX3f7a
1230226132919898113 2020-02-19 12:22:21 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> A gifted poet, Gwendolyn Brooks became the first African American to win a Pulitzer Prize.

1228415096860422144 2020-02-14 12:25:56 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Protecting whistleblowers is essential to shining light on misconduct in our government and the private sector.

1228358951256907777 2020-02-14 08:42:50 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> For 352 days, H.R. 8, lifesaving legislation to #EndGunViolence, has sat on Leader McConnell’s desk despite calls for action by the people of Parkland and Americans nationwide. @HouseDemocrats stand with these persistent, young leaders to demand an end to the bloodshed.
1228358948937445378 2020-02-14 08:42:49 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Two years after an act of terror and murder stole 17 lives and injured 17 others in Parkland, Florida, we continue to be inspired by the survivors &amp; families who turned their grief into courageous action. #NeverAgain  https://t.co/kcNUyc3tU4  https://t.co/K8lnh2JACU

1228063805793591300 2020-02-13 13:10:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President’s latest effort to steal Congressionally-appropriated military funding in order to build his wasteful, ineffective border wall undermines our national security and the separation of powers enshrined in our Constitution.
1228063155017932800 2020-02-13 13:07:27 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, with this strong War Powers Resolution, the Senate is joining the House in honoring our responsibility: keeping the American people safe. The Congress and the American people know we cannot afford war.  https://t.co/THy00NVwOU

1227745488889425923 2020-02-12 16:05:09 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Every day the GOP anti-health care lawsuit is allowed to endure is another day that Americans’ health care is under threat.

1227662009153597442 2020-02-12 10:33:26 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President’s budget would increase the national debt – passing that expense on to our children – all so he can give a tax cut to the wealthiest Americans. #TrumpBudget  https://t.co/CkhkIZfpBg

1227421325217685507 2020-02-11 18:37:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> By tweet @realDonaldTrump engaged in political interference in the sentencing of Roger Stone. It is outrageous that DOJ has deeply damaged the rule of law by withdrawing its recommendation. Stepping down of prosecutors should be commended &amp; actions of DOJ should be investigated.
1227348258646843392 2020-02-11 13:46:42 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> This AAPI Equal Pay Day, we recommit ourselves to the moral cause of economic prosperity for all Americans and decry the fact that on this day, AAPI women’s wages finally catch up to a man’s earnings from the previous year. It’s unacceptable. #AAPIEqualPay  https://t.co/6eiWlYFaa0
1227331885472387074 2020-02-11 12:41:38 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> 30,000 veterans 700,000 residents 219 years without a full voice in our government  The people of Washington, DC have been denied a full voice in their own government for far too long. It’s time for #DCStatehood.
1227282634520350720 2020-02-11 09:25:56 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The #TrumpBudget is defined by countless broken promises to the American people.  https://t.co/QZ2sHbmf4v
1227277364046041088 2020-02-11 09:04:59 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The #TrumpBudget is an attack on the good health, financial security and well-being of the American people. Tune in at 12:15 pm ET as @SenSchumer and I discuss its broken promises to hard-working families.  https://t.co/rFd2fqW3Qv

1226999260786446336 2020-02-10 14:39:54 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Half a trillion slashed from Medicare. $900 billion cut from Medicaid. The #TrumpBudget is the latest in a long line of attacks the President has carried out on the health &amp; economic security of hard-working Americans.  https://t.co/D8Vv8fxdK9  https://t.co/jQThQv9u16
1226948347581337601 2020-02-10 11:17:36 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Soaring prices are putting must-have medications out of reach for too many Americans.  @HouseDemocrats passed the #LowerDrugCosts Now Act to set things straight.  It’s time for Leader McConnell to stop blocking change.  https://t.co/eNPo938lYN
1226708310226874375 2020-02-09 19:23:46 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The budget is a statement of values. Once again, the #TrumpBudget makes it painfully clear how little the President values the good health, financial security and well-being of America’s hard-working families.  https://t.co/ohbibWuyY1
1226675912646840322 2020-02-09 17:15:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Wonderful to take time to visit with some of our nation’s hardworking governors today at the @NatlGovsAssoc Winter Meeting. Such a pleasure to speak with Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero of Guam, @OregonGovBrown, and Maine’s @GovJanetMills. #WeTheStates  https://t.co/4MLtkzbHEt
1226535209421680640 2020-02-09 07:55:56 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Last week, we stood up against President Trump’s efforts to mislead the American people &amp; took a stand for workers’ rights. Here are a few moments that stood out.  https://t.co/41neDaxHn2
1226293053234851840 2020-02-08 15:53:41 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> In declaring their loyalty to the president over our Constitution, Leader McConnell &amp; Senate Republicans have made a farce of the old boast that the U.S. Senate is the greatest deliberative body in the world. #DefendOurDemocracy  https://t.co/AA7Fw72PeO
1225965000801603584 2020-02-07 18:10:08 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Read my full statement here:  https://t.co/NzfBin6vHz
1225964999904026626 2020-02-07 18:10:07 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Lieutenant Colonel Vindman has proven to be an American patriot. His firing was a clear and brazen act of retaliation that showcases the President’s fear of the truth — and the vindictiveness which led Republican Senators to be accomplices to President Trump’s cover-up.
1225887499542843393 2020-02-07 13:02:10 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> .@RepAndyLevin has spent most of his career fighting for workers’ rights. Now, he is continuing that work by fighting to see the #PROAct become law.  https://t.co/I5mxbESZKu
1225854411752312832 2020-02-07 10:50:41 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Grateful to @RepThompson and every House Democrat who spoke out during Gun Violence Survivors Week. Gun violence impacts American communities every day. Survivors deserve to know Congress is serious in our commitment to #EndGunViolence.
1225554091209875456 2020-02-06 14:57:19 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Thank you, Interim President @jguaido, for joining us today to discuss the plight of the people of Venezuela. We stand with you and support your calls for free &amp; fair elections.  https://t.co/TvGOiJYhbl
1225548800313393154 2020-02-06 14:36:18 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Tuskegee Airmen bravely fought enemies abroad &amp; racism at home.

1225451396721496064 2020-02-06 08:09:15 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> I’m speaking with reporters live from the U.S. Capitol.  https://t.co/CEf7GBFCwb
1225197373183447043 2020-02-05 15:19:51 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The House will continue to protect our Constitution &amp; #DefendOurDemocracy, both in the courts of law and in the court of public opinion.  https://t.co/ZJbCDFHvo6
1225197372348694528 2020-02-05 15:19:51 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Because of the Republican Senate’s betrayal of the Constitution, the President remains an ongoing threat to American democracy, with his insistence that he is above the law and that he can corrupt the elections if he wants to.
1225197371254067202 2020-02-05 15:19:51 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President will boast that he has been acquitted. There can be no acquittal without a trial, and no trial without witnesses, documents and evidence.
1225197370440404992 2020-02-05 15:19:50 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump was impeached with the support of a majority of the American people – a first in our nation’s history. And now he is the first President in history to face a bipartisan vote to convict him in the Senate.
1225197369244909568 2020-02-05 15:19:50 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Our Founders put safeguards in the Constitution to protect against a rogue president. They never imagined that they would at the same time have a rogue leader in the Senate who would cowardly abandon his duty to uphold the Constitution.  https://t.co/YPL5at8tWU

1225126777510670339 2020-02-05 10:39:20 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Democrats have been working to build an economy that works for workers since Day One. This week, we build on that progress by passing the #PROAct, to protect the rights of workers to join a union.  https://t.co/lPJRjDF9zX

1224791075933556738 2020-02-04 12:25:22 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump promised to “negotiate like crazy” for lower prescription prices.  That must mean not negotiate at all, because he has stood side by side with Big Pharma against @HouseDemocrats’ bill to do exactly that, the #LowerDrugCosts Now Act. #SOTU
1224790480044613633 2020-02-04 12:23:00 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> 1) Health care 2) Health care 3) Health care  Those are the three most important issues to America’s working families – and that is why Democrats have invited dozens of patients, doctors &amp; health care advocates to sit in the House Gallery tonight. #SOTU

1224506621491019776 2020-02-03 17:35:03 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Democrats championed the #VolckerRule to prevent the financial recklessness that led to 8 million jobs lost &amp; record foreclosures after the Great Recession. By weakening this rule, the Trump Admin is gambling with the financial future of millions of working families in America.
1224174395620499457 2020-02-02 19:34:54 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> To our @49ers: thank you for an incredible season, and an inspiring performance on the field tonight. You made us proud. Congratulations to the @Chiefs on their victory. #SuperBowl

1223753278321721351 2020-02-01 15:41:32 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> I am greatly saddened to hear of the passing of Sister Margaret Claydon: a beloved pillar of the Trinity community and a revolutionary who transformed women’s education in America. May her courage continue to inspire the thousands of lives she touched.  https://t.co/4cBpbfRLQ1
1223653085958066188 2020-02-01 09:03:24 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> This #BlackHistoryMonth, we celebrate our beautiful diversity and the outstanding contributions, achievements and strength of the African American community.  https://t.co/ui62WMJzNW  https://t.co/TEtz3p2I39
1223614899034652673 2020-02-01 06:31:40 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> It is a sad day for America to see Senator McConnell humiliate the Chief Justice of the United States into presiding over a vote which rejected our nation’s judicial norms, precedents and institutions which uphold the Constitution and the rule of law.
1223414099473846273 2020-01-31 17:13:45 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> In the coming weeks, the House will bring the NO BAN Act to the Floor to prohibit religious discrimination in our immigration system and limit the President’s ability to impose such biased and bigoted restrictions.  https://t.co/prysRGMwzh
1223414098614018057 2020-01-31 17:13:45 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Trump Admin’s expansion of its un-American travel ban is a threat to our security, our values and the rule of law. Barring more than 350 million people from predominantly African countries from traveling to the US, this rule is discrimination disguised as policy.
1223396593585606656 2020-01-31 16:04:12 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump was impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. By refusing to call witnesses and compel documents, Senate Republicans have chosen to become accomplices in his cover-up. #DefendOurDemocracy  https://t.co/cHfatTHnbh
1222989609258360832 2020-01-30 13:06:59 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> You cannot be acquitted if you don’t have a trial. You don’t have a trial if you don’t have witnesses and documentation.    If Republican Senators choose a cover-up, the American people and history will judge it with the harshness it deserves.
1222969225616285696 2020-01-30 11:45:59 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, we remember Fred Korematsu, for his bravery and defiance in the face of unjust treatment of Japanese Americans during World War II.

1222667522014576641 2020-01-29 15:47:07 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Eleven years after the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act became law, far too many women &amp; girls still face pay inequality every day. We can never backdown from our commitment to achieving pay #EqualPay for all. It’s time for the Senate to pass the #PaycheckFairness Act!
1222620933556527105 2020-01-29 12:42:00 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The American people have spoken clearly – and history is on their side.

1222233742191857664 2020-01-28 11:03:26 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Supreme Court’s decision to grant the Trump Admin more time to advance its cruel &amp; unlawful attacks on immigrants is a serious &amp; troubling departure from long-standing judicial norms.

1222224868667727874 2020-01-28 10:28:11 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Last week, I led a bipartisan Congressional Delegation to Poland and Israel to commemorate 75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz.

1222186583295696901 2020-01-28 07:56:03 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> SNAP is a vital lifeline for millions seeking a pathway out of poverty. Yesterday, the House filed a brief in federal court opposing the Trump Admin’s unlawful rule which will steal food from 700,000 Americans. #HandsOffSNAP   Read my full statement here:  https://t.co/r3OeBlPYxs
1222148263501008897 2020-01-28 05:23:47 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Trump’s lawyers argued he has a right to abuse his power as much as he wants, and Congress can do nothing about it.  Sounds familiar:  Trump: “I have an Article 2, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president.”  Congress can do something: hold a fair trial.
1221868572785500160 2020-01-27 10:52:23 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The stories told by Holocaust survivors remind us of the consequences of unchecked evil &amp; of our duty to stand up to anti-Semitism &amp; all hatred wherever they appear. We must ensure that those stories &amp; the lessons they provide live on forever. #HolocaustMemorialDay #WeRemember  https://t.co/xLUvi0GzhQ
1221818227854118912 2020-01-27 07:32:20 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Three years after the Trump Admin launched its outrageous Muslim travel ban, reports indicate the Admin is preparing to expand this dangerous policy.

1221587345092292609 2020-01-26 16:14:53 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Amb. Bolton reportedly heard directly from Trump that aid for Ukraine was tied to political investigations.  The refusal of the Senate to call for him, other relevant witnesses, and documents is now even more indefensible.  The choice is clear: our Constitution, or a cover-up.
1221205746290974723 2020-01-25 14:58:33 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Every Lunar New Year, San Francisco is transformed by the vibrancy &amp; spirit that accompanies this time of celebration.

We extend our deepest condolences to the friends &amp; families of these heroes who fought so bravely to protect those impacted by the wildfires.
1220576251662028801 2020-01-23 21:17:10 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, we concluded our visit to Israel for the #WorldHolocaustForum ceremony with the presence and the personal narratives of Holocaust survivors.

1220461809783705601 2020-01-23 13:42:25 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> This morning, during our visit to Israel for the #WorldHolocaustForum, I met with @PresidentRuvi where we discussed our shared commitment to continue to build upon the strong bipartisan U.S.-Israel relationship.  https://t.co/pbvCtjuF2n
1220447905112363009 2020-01-23 12:47:10 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Americans rely on clean water to grow our food, preserve our ecosystems &amp; protect the health of our children. By giving polluters free rein to dump pollutants into waters, the Trump Admin is threatening the drinking water of 117 million Americans.  https://t.co/J3LZZgHnmo
1220413523928453122 2020-01-23 10:30:32 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Our nation has lost a champion for truth and transparency. As one of the founders of PBS NewsHour, as well as its longtime host, Jim Lehrer worked to keep America’s leaders accountable to the people. My prayers are with his wife, Kate, and their family.  https://t.co/5BU80D0u3p
1220267977892868096 2020-01-23 00:52:12 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> As our delegation prepares to participate in the #WorldHolocaustForum in Israel today, we are grateful that our first stop on this visit was to Auschwitz-Birkenau where so many Jews, Poles and others perished. Never again.  https://t.co/4uFfK66VRi
1220117737915211776 2020-01-22 14:55:12 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> 47 years after #RoevWade ensured women's control over their reproductive health, our message is clear:   We will not go back.   We will not rest until all women have access to the comprehensive health care they need and are treated equally under the law.  https://t.co/SCQ0Z5o02W
1220109631357362176 2020-01-22 14:22:59 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> By failing to defend the @CFPB, the Trump Admin is failing millions of Americans whose financial security is threatened by abusive financial actors. Led by @RepMaxineWaters, House Democrats will fight these attacks on the Consumer Bureau.  https://t.co/AdL38SbrmV
1220078188610703360 2020-01-22 12:18:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, our delegation began its visit in Israel by holding meetings w/ @Netanyahu, @YuliEdelstein &amp; Knesset members, &amp; @AvigdorLiberman w/ the purpose of continuing to build on the strong bonds between our two nations as we mark 75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz.  https://t.co/q2jfEiXRQF
1219978313407586305 2020-01-22 05:41:10 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump confessed and then he tried to cover it up. Remember how we got here and why we need to #DefendOurDemocracy.  https://t.co/MIKLzIQTYf
1219774241664643079 2020-01-21 16:10:16 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Tonight, our bipartisan delegation concluded our visit to Poland by laying roses at the last remaining portion of the Ghetto Wall in Krakow’s Jewish quarter to honor the victims and survivors of the Holocaust.  https://t.co/IW0tmmnG8d
1219773193877102592 2020-01-21 16:06:06 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The House has filed a brief in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals condemning the Trump Admin’s use of government initiatives to stoke a campaign of fear &amp; discrimination against America’s immigrant communities.

1219759416116944902 2020-01-21 15:11:21 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> In Krakow, our bipartisan delegation had the honor of visiting the bustling Jewish Community Center where we witnessed the center’s efforts to expand the rapid resurgence of the Jewish awareness in Krakow and across Poland.  https://t.co/yIDsiZ5Vhi
1219702761861849089 2020-01-21 11:26:14 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Trump Admin is engaged in an all-out campaign to destroy protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions. The longer this GOP lawsuit continues, the longer it will drive up costs &amp; endanger life-saving pre-existing condition protections.  https://t.co/HIfFhsPaUP
1219688936706015232 2020-01-21 10:31:17 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, our bipartisan Congressional Delegation visited Auschwitz-Birkenau to commemorate 75 years since liberation &amp; reaffirm our commitment that the horrors of the Holocaust will never be repeated. Never Again.  https://t.co/pyfFAmuyS3
1219639237483671557 2020-01-21 07:13:48 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President’s legal position is that he has a right to abuse his power as much as he wants, and there is nothing Congress can do about it.   The Founders disagreed on both, and there is something Congress can do: hold a fair trial. #DefendOurDemocracy  https://t.co/JilXWEiALh
1219619319522512896 2020-01-21 05:54:39 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Leader McConnell’s plan for a dark of night impeachment trial confirms what the American people have seen since Day One: the Senate GOP Leader has chosen a cover-up for the President, rather than honor his oath to the Constitution.  https://t.co/qPHy84MRhe
1219392062270967808 2020-01-20 14:51:37 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The draft #USMCA originally put forward by President Trump failed to protect America’s workers, had huge giveaways to Big Pharma &amp; fell far short on the environment. The USMCA I signed this morning has been transformed by Democrats’ leadership for hard-working Americans.  https://t.co/Rb2RhZQW7k
1219267888420442112 2020-01-20 06:38:12 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Martin Luther King, Jr.’s lasting legacy of service and activism continues to inspire generations to fight for a brighter, more just future for all Americans. We must ensure the lessons he taught &amp; the story of his life live on for generations to come. #MLKDay  https://t.co/4hu63NsZja
1219004520803508224 2020-01-19 13:11:40 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The American people agree: the Senate needs to see the witnesses and documents that President Trump blocked in the House. Just like every other impeachment trial, just like any trial. The question is whether their Senators will listen. #RealTime  https://t.co/D79Ni6WcrX
1218724132130578434 2020-01-18 18:37:30 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> This week marked an important chapter for the U.S. Congress, our Constitution, and America as a whole. Here are some moments that stood out. #DefendOurDemocracy  https://t.co/upzfN8hxiV

1218635582135554049 2020-01-18 12:45:38 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President has been impeached – and nothing either he or Leader McConnell can do will change that. #RealTime  https://t.co/SVeuVW4I2g
1218579290775805952 2020-01-18 09:01:57 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The House could not ignore the President’s abuses of power – and neither should the Senate. #RealTime  https://t.co/gRY2EfdmJq
1218547269085036544 2020-01-18 06:54:43 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The House has done its Constitutional duty.

1218249274489819138 2020-01-17 11:10:35 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Wonderful to hear that Alyssa Nakken has become the first woman coach in MLB herstory! Proud of both her and our @SFGiants, and can’t wait to see what the future holds.  https://t.co/pPq3eCiQXg

1217629137688506368 2020-01-15 18:06:23 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico have waited too long for the Trump Admin to release billions of dollars in urgently needed disaster assistance. By illegally withholding these funds, the Admin has harmed countless survivors and prevented Puerto Rico from rebuilding.

1217558253791535104 2020-01-15 13:24:43 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President has been impeached, and that is forever.   He was frivolous with the Constitution, the Senate should not be. #DefendOurDemocracy  https://t.co/dzp1gJSND6
1217556004268847116 2020-01-15 13:15:47 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Congratulations to Speaker @EFillerCorn and the people of Virginia on passing the Equal Rights Amendment today.  This historic vote takes America closer to our Founding ideal: that all are created equal.

1217403054368182273 2020-01-15 03:08:01 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> There can be no full &amp; fair trial in the Senate if Leader McConnell blocks the Senate from hearing witnesses and obtaining documents President Trump is covering up. #DefendOurDemocracy
1217403053470638080 2020-01-15 03:08:00 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President has fought tooth-and-nail to keep thousands of documents away from the public. And no wonder – each time new pieces come out, they show President Trump right at the center of the effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.
1217170364587028480 2020-01-14 11:43:23 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> American elections should be decided by the American people, not by the Russian Government. Retweet if you agree!

1217157948004339714 2020-01-14 10:54:03 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Reports of ongoing Russian interference in US elections to benefit the President &amp; undermine our democracy highlight the need for action.  Our intel &amp; law enforcement officials have been clear about the threat.  Why doesn’t the President have a plan to protect our elections?
1217138838377783296 2020-01-14 09:38:07 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Ten years after the Supreme Court delivered its disastrous Citizens United decision, Democrats are coming together to call on Leader McConnell to end his blockade of the #ForThePeople Act, and other House-passed reforms.  https://t.co/aNAEXYZS1e
1217129265650642946 2020-01-14 09:00:04 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The House upheld its duty to #DefendOurDemocracy by passing two articles of impeachment against the President. Tomorrow, we will transmit those articles &amp; name impeachment managers. The Senate must choose between the Constitution &amp; a cover-up.  https://t.co/tcPdHeMUGp  https://t.co/ebqA3Z1oBi
1217033679102533633 2020-01-14 02:40:15 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> This is why President Trump was impeached for obstruction of Congress, and why a Senate trial with no witnesses or documents is a cover-up. #EndTheCoverUp #DefendOurDemocracy  https://t.co/w9Gl5VmjBu
1216883084718723072 2020-01-13 16:41:50 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Mr. President, actions speak louder than words. And for the last three years, you have taken every opportunity to dismantle protections for the 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. #ProtectOurCare
1216875434387955712 2020-01-13 16:11:26 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Congratulations to @iingwen and the Taiwanese people on this momentous election, reaffirming their commitment to a free, open and democratic society.  https://t.co/ehokCcBz3M
1216802753122656256 2020-01-13 11:22:38 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> In the Clinton impeachment process, 66 witnesses were allowed to testify including 3 in the Senate trial, and 90,000 pages of documents were turned over.  Trump was too afraid to let any of his top aides testify &amp; covered up every single document. The Senate must #EndTheCoverUp
1216800117904302082 2020-01-13 11:12:09 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> If President Trump’s anti-health care lawsuit is successful, life-saving protections will be torn away from millions of families across America. #ProtectOurCare
1216800116973211648 2020-01-13 11:12:09 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> 130 million Americans live every day with pre-existing conditions. They depend on knowing their health care, secured by protections in the ACA, is there when they need it. #ProtectOurCare
1216742851926732803 2020-01-13 07:24:36 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> After this weekend's 6.0 earthquake, we continue to pray for our fellow American citizens in Puerto Rico. Trump Admin must quickly approve Governor's request for a Major Disaster Declaration and stop withholding Congressionally appropriated funds to recover from 2017 hurricanes.
1216411265645600770 2020-01-12 09:27:00 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> At the end of 2019, I led a bipartisan Congressional delegation to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge. The message from our veterans was clear: pray for peace. @ThisWeekABC  https://t.co/8A6IJf7tOc
1216395116941922304 2020-01-12 08:22:50 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President has been impeached – and no amount of gamesmanship from Leader McConnell will erase that fact. #DefendOurDemocracy @ThisWeekABC  https://t.co/SWPASPFqeB
1216386166108442624 2020-01-12 07:47:16 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> History – and the American public – are clear: the Senate should hear from witnesses who have direct knowledge of the President’s abuses of power. #DefendOurDemocracy @ThisWeekABC  https://t.co/bzTSlkNc2J
1215760060711952387 2020-01-10 14:19:20 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> So-called “forever chemicals” are threatening the health and well-being of thousands of American communities. Thank you, @RepDebDingell, for helping lead the fight to clean up contaminated sites nationwide.  https://t.co/sWHCGlST6E
1215680287511908352 2020-01-10 09:02:21 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> By joining a resolution to dismiss, Sen. McConnell showed his true colors. Americans have now seen what is at stake in a fair trial with witnesses &amp; evidence, and new evidence has emerged. Every Senator will have to vote: is their loyalty is to the President or the Constitution?
1215397396760465410 2020-01-09 14:18:15 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Read my full statement on the Trump Administration’s announcement that it will revise implementation guidelines for the National Environment Policy Act here:  https://t.co/cB7UFLepMI
1215397395242135557 2020-01-09 14:18:14 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> American communities are already feeling the effects of the #ClimateCrisis. By revising guidelines for the National Environment Policy Act, the Admin is once again ignoring science and putting the needs of special interests &amp; donors ahead of the well-being of American families.
1215373054647394304 2020-01-09 12:41:31 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> If Republican Senators move for a quick dismissal of the charges against the President, with no witnesses or documents, it will be because they are afraid of the truth.   Dismissal = cover-up  #DefendOurDemocracy  https://t.co/umIRNjqopH
1215356168119508994 2020-01-09 11:34:25 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> We must protect Americans right to worship &amp; gather free from fear or violence. Tune in as I sign H.R. 2476, the Securing American Nonprofit Organizations Against Terrorism Act.  https://t.co/SpcpIzrTxM
1215312069207252993 2020-01-09 08:39:11 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Instead of defending the law of the land, the Trump Justice Department is *fighting to tear down* the Affordable Care Act — to erase pre-existing condition protections, end the ban on lifetime limits of coverage, and destroy all its other protections. #ProtectOurCare
1215301987052531712 2020-01-09 07:59:07 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Tune in as I speak with reporters as the House prepares to vote on a War Power Resolution limiting President Trump’s military actions regarding Iran.  https://t.co/52Ti1FNj1Y
1215290370457788416 2020-01-09 07:12:57 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> My weekly press conference will be at 10:45 am ET.  Tune in here to watch:  https://t.co/rFd2fqW3Qv
1215012460454916096 2020-01-08 12:48:39 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The House is moving forward with @RepSlotkin's War Powers Resolution limiting the President’s military actions regarding Iran. The Admin must work with the Congress to advance an immediate, effective de-escalatory strategy which prevents further violence.  https://t.co/i3KU9bqWqh  https://t.co/9bwnjBMjnz
1215003816619335681 2020-01-08 12:14:18 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Congratulations, @LondonBreed, on your swearing-in today. I look forward to working with you to continue San Francisco’s proud tradition of standing as a guiding light for progress across America.  https://t.co/XTJQYv6RVF
1214999457567301632 2020-01-08 11:56:58 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Every year, I am brought back to this moment. @GabbyGiffords, you have been a model of strength and persistence for the last nine years. Even as our hearts ache for those impacted by gun violence, every day of your fight to end gun violence gives us hope for the future.
1214990914344624128 2020-01-08 11:23:02 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Make no mistake:  This commonsense, bipartisan legislation will save lives – if only Leader McConnell would bring it up for a vote in the Senate.  Enough is enough. It’s time for the @SenateGOP to do the right thing and work with us to #EndGunViolence.
1214990912562114565 2020-01-08 11:23:01 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Communities all across America have experienced the tragic reality of gun violence – yet for too long, their pain was met with silence from Congress. That ended 365 days ago, as @HouseDemocrats introduced H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act.  https://t.co/IQ8VW2CwSp
1214943356394057733 2020-01-08 08:14:03 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> It is a pleasure to welcome Prime Minister @kmitsotakis of Greece to the U.S. Capitol to discuss the strong partnership between our two countries.  https://t.co/CFRFqXfFhW
1214706118494212104 2020-01-07 16:31:21 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Closely monitoring the situation following bombings targeting U.S. troops in Iraq. We must ensure the safety of our servicemembers, including ending needless provocations from the Administration and demanding that Iran cease its violence. America &amp; world cannot afford war.
1214687264342781955 2020-01-07 15:16:26 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> As a Californian, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact caused by earthquakes. The Trump Admin must quickly respond to the recent earthquakes in Puerto Rico with the urgency &amp; compassion our fellow Americans there deserve.  https://t.co/4c7Wso4T9J  https://t.co/fjmcThYBen
1214250869983793163 2020-01-06 10:22:21 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The President &amp; Sen. McConnell have run out of excuses. They must allow key witnesses to testify, and produce the documents Trump has blocked, so Americans can see the facts for themselves.  The Senate cannot be complicit in the President's cover-up. #DefendOurDemocracy
1213995418679435266 2020-01-05 17:27:17 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The thoughts of all Americans are with the families of the US servicemember &amp; contractors killed &amp; with wounded Defense Dept. personnel in Manda Bay, Kenya. Together with our allies, we must strengthen our commitment to defeating al-Shabaab &amp; the forces of terror in the world.
1213612759574863874 2020-01-04 16:06:44 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> President Trump’s classified War Powers Act notification raises more questions than it answers about the timing, manner and justification of the decision to engage in hostilities against Iran.  https://t.co/T9Oi6bRMDP
1213233124978638848 2020-01-03 14:58:12 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Every day that Republicans’ anti-health care lawsuit is allowed to endure is a day that American families will be forced to live in uncertainty &amp; fear. Unless the USSC acts, families will continue to face needless disruption in their coverage &amp; premiums.  https://t.co/qpl4Zshtwp
1213211599101661191 2020-01-03 13:32:40 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Today, @SenateMajLdr McConnell made clear that he will feebly comply with President Trump’s cover-up of his abuses of power and be an accomplice to that cover-up. The American people deserve the truth. #DefendOurDemocracy  https://t.co/QpVwYwAtBe
1213096517948596224 2020-01-03 05:55:22 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> The Trump Admin has conducted strikes in Iraq targeting high-level Iranian military officials and killing Iranian Quds Force Commander Qasem Soleimani without an AUMF against Iran. Further, this action was taken without the consultation of the Congress.
1213096517063589890 2020-01-03 05:55:22 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> American leaders’ highest priority is to protect American lives and interests. But we cannot put the lives of American servicemembers, diplomats and others further at risk by engaging in provocative and disproportionate actions.  https://t.co/o0R8YVJMNW
1212849365351571462 2020-01-02 13:33:17 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Enough is enough. @HouseDemocrats passed the bipartisan #LowerDrugCosts Now Act last year to stop Big Pharma from charging Americans more for our medicines than what they charge for the same drugs overseas. The GOP Senate should join us &amp; pass #HR3 now!  https://t.co/9AwBSxGJ2a
1212830393084321793 2020-01-02 12:17:53 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> Trump engaged in unprecedented, total obstruction of Congress, hiding these emails, all other documents, and his top aides from the American people.  His excuse was a phony complaint about the House process.  What’s the excuse now? Why won’t Trump &amp; McConnell allow a fair trial?
1212547497278812160 2020-01-01 17:33:46 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> 157 years ago, President Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation took effect, starting the process of freeing slaves across America which would end 36 months later, with the abolition of slavery in Texas.
1212531510974304256 2020-01-01 16:30:14 -0800 <SpeakerPelosi> For six years, Americans of every age have been protected against health insurance discrimination if they have pre-existing conditions.  Now, Trump and Republicans are trying to tear away those protections. #ProtectOurCare
