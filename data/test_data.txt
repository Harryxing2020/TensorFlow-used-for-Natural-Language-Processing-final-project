1328133691529375751 2020-11-15 16:32:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congratulations to NASA and SpaceX on today's launch. It’s a testament to the power of science and what we can accomplish by harnessing our innovation, ingenuity, and determination. I join all Americans and the people of Japan in wishing the astronauts Godspeed on their journey.
1327649998092214273 2020-11-14 08:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To the millions of Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and Buddhists celebrating the Festival of Lights, @DrBiden and I send our best wishes for a #HappyDiwali. May your new year be filled with hope, happiness, and prosperity. Sal Mubarak.
1327418361001676800 2020-11-13 17:09:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> I am the president-elect, but will not be president until next year. COVID-19 does not respect dates on the calendar, it is accelerating right now. Urgent action is needed today, now, by the current administration.
1327418359848300545 2020-11-13 17:09:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> I am alarmed by the surge in reported COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and fatalities. This crisis demands a robust and immediate federal response which has been woefully lacking.
1327394562906542080 2020-11-13 15:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As the remnants of Tropical Storm Eta continue to impact the east coast, I encourage everyone in its path to heed the warnings of emergency responders and local officials. Jill and I send our prayers to those facing yet another storm.
1327356814552305664 2020-11-13 13:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today marks five years since the horrific ISIS terrorist attacks in Paris — an assault not just on the people of France but against our common humanity.  As president, I will work to protect Americans and our allies, countering terrorism and extremist violence in all forms.
1326968002839908353 2020-11-12 11:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I extend my deep condolences to the loved ones of the peacekeepers, including 6 American service members, who died on Tiran Island, and wish a speedy recovery to the surviving American. I join all Americans in honoring their sacrifice, as I keep their loved ones in my prayers.
1326955421320450049 2020-11-12 10:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Because of the Affordable Care Act:  - People with pre-existing conditions are protected - More than 20 million Americans gained coverage - Nearly 12 million seniors have had their prescription drug costs reduced  Now more than ever, we have to protect and build on it.  https://t.co/Vl5yliyUFm
1326696150364286976 2020-11-11 17:19:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ron Klain’s deep, varied experience and capacity to work with people all across the political spectrum is precisely what I need in a White House chief of staff as we confront this moment of crisis and bring our country together again.
1326638331204038656 2020-11-11 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This Veterans Day, I feel the full weight of the honor and the responsibility that has been entrusted to me by the American people as the next president, and I vow to honor our country’s sacred obligation.  https://t.co/BuynOGvSO0
1326557341697839106 2020-11-11 08:08:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, we honor the service of those who have worn the uniform of the Armed Forces of the United States.   To our proud veterans—I will be a commander in chief who respects your sacrifice, understands your service, and will never betray the values you fought so bravely to defend.
1326344141446373376 2020-11-10 18:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are going to build a health care system that puts you and your family first — and that every American can be proud of.
1326325015290273792 2020-11-10 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If you’re sick, if you’re struggling, if you’re worried about how you’re going to get through the day — we will not abandon you.  We will not leave you to face these challenges alone.  https://t.co/eZUHaFE5bl
1326306141056364544 2020-11-10 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When I’m speaking to foreign leaders, I’m telling them: America is going to be back. We’re going to be back in the game.
1326284750420643846 2020-11-10 14:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Come January, we will work quickly with Congress to dramatically ramp up health care protections, get America to universal coverage, and lower health care costs.
1326272198659645440 2020-11-10 13:15:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tune in as my campaign provides a post-election legal briefing.  https://t.co/vApRDU8lTR
1326266378991542272 2020-11-10 12:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Beginning on January 20th, Vice President-elect Harris and I are going to do everything in our power to ease the burden of health care on you and your families.
1326245116462260224 2020-11-10 11:27:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, the Trump Administration is in court, attempting to eliminate the Affordable Care Act. Tune in as I discuss how my administration will expand access to quality, affordable health care.  https://t.co/JB5uwBTKnd
1326214285949865986 2020-11-10 09:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@KamalaHarris and I aren’t wasting any time. We’re ready to get COVID-19 under control so that we can reopen our businesses and schools safely, resume our lives, and put this pandemic behind us.  https://t.co/65C1XfR9rR
1325906004912037895 2020-11-09 13:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let's get to work, @KamalaHarris.  https://t.co/uYe2EsmaFa
1325890910635384839 2020-11-09 12:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> I won't be president until January 20th, but my message today to everyone is this: wear a mask.
1325885871875190784 2020-11-09 11:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The bottom line: I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around.
1325880083618426881 2020-11-09 11:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The challenge before us right now is still immense and growing, and so is the need for bold action to fight this pandemic.
1325873288711712769 2020-11-09 10:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My COVID-19 Transition Advisory Board will advise on detailed plans built on a bedrock of science, and that keep compassion, empathy, and care for every American at its core.
1325870017401905152 2020-11-09 10:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, I have named a COVID-19 Transition Advisory Board, comprised of distinguished public health experts, to help our transition team translate the Biden-Harris COVID-19 plan into a blueprint we can put into place as soon as @KamalaHarris and I are sworn into office.
1325842292444291072 2020-11-09 08:46:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> I spent the morning with the co-chairs of my COVID-19 Council discussing the status of this pandemic and how we move forward. Tune in as I provide an update on how we're going to beat this virus.  https://t.co/VVGHZNnUFY
1325261759456874499 2020-11-07 18:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> From the bottom of my heart: thank you.  https://t.co/s76oHFkr66
1325259242631274496 2020-11-07 18:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A nation united.  A nation strengthened.  A nation healed.  The United States of America.
1325258739318927361 2020-11-07 18:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> With full hearts and steady hands, with faith in America and in each other, with a love of country — and a thirst for justice — let us be the nation that we know we can be.
1325257984562192385 2020-11-07 18:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight, the whole world is watching America. I believe at our best America is a beacon for the globe.  And we lead not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.
1325257229625421825 2020-11-07 18:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Especially for those moments when this campaign was at its lowest — the African American community stood up again for me. They always have my back, and I’ll have yours.
1325256474415800322 2020-11-07 17:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe that this is part of the mandate from the American people. They want us to cooperate.  That’s the choice I’ll make. And I call on the Congress — Democrats and Republicans alike — to make that choice with me.
1325255719336243200 2020-11-07 17:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Now that the campaign is over—what is the people’s will? What is our mandate?  I believe it is this: Americans have called on us to marshal the forces of decency and the forces of fairness. To marshal the forces of science and the forces of hope in the great battles of our time.
1325254964415881216 2020-11-07 17:53:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life’s most precious moments — hugging a grandchild, birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us — until we get this virus under control.
1325254461049073664 2020-11-07 17:51:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Bible tells us that to everything there is a season — a time to build, a time to reap, a time to sow. And a time to heal.  This is the time to heal in America.
1325254209613123584 2020-11-07 17:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric.  To lower the temperature.  To see each other again.  To listen to each other again.
1325253706061926401 2020-11-07 17:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To all those who volunteered, worked the polls in the middle of this pandemic, local election officials — you deserve a special thanks from this nation.
1325253454571270144 2020-11-07 17:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> For America’s educators, this is a great day: You’re going to have one of your own in the White House, and Jill is going to make a great First Lady.
1325253203022241792 2020-11-07 17:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I pledge to be a President who seeks not to divide, but to unify.  Who doesn’t see Red and Blue states, but a United States.  And who will work with all my heart to win the confidence of the whole people.
1325252951124762625 2020-11-07 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, the people of this nation have spoken.  They have delivered us a clear victory. A convincing victory.  A victory for “We the People.”
1325247969780621317 2020-11-07 17:25:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> A new day in America has come. Tune in as Vice President-Elect @KamalaHarris and I address the nation.  https://t.co/d38F58DHu8
1325118992785223682 2020-11-07 08:52:42 -0800 <JoeBiden> America, I’m honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country.  The work ahead of us will be hard, but I promise you this: I will be a President for all Americans — whether you voted for me or not.  I will keep the faith that you have placed in me.  https://t.co/moA9qhmjn8
1324926298762870785 2020-11-06 20:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We may be opponents — but we are not enemies.   We are Americans.
1324925795991609348 2020-11-06 20:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to remember the purpose of our politics isn’t totally unrelenting warfare.
1324925040660393987 2020-11-06 20:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know tensions can be high after a tough election like we just had.  But we need to remain calm. Patient. And let the process work out as we count all the votes.
1324924538749026306 2020-11-06 20:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are going to be the first Democrats to win Arizona in 24 years.  We are going to be the first Democrats to win Georgia in 28 years.  And we re-built the Blue Wall in the middle of the country that crumbled just four years ago.
1324924285631176704 2020-11-06 19:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> What is becoming clearer each hour is that record numbers of Americans — from all races, faiths, regions — chose change over more of the same.   They have given us a mandate for action on COVID and the economy and climate change and systemic racism.
1324923025138049027 2020-11-06 19:53:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> The numbers tell us a clear and convincing story: We're going to win this race.
1324921258845204480 2020-11-06 19:46:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tune in as I address the nation on the current state of the race.  https://t.co/w0er4issEk
1324531952230289408 2020-11-05 18:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is going to court to stop votes from being counted. We have assembled the largest election protection effort in history to fight back and need your help.  Chip in to make sure every vote is counted:  https://t.co/ksrwxu9nDE
1324521884394921985 2020-11-05 17:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Keep the faith, folks.
1324511817658441728 2020-11-05 16:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No one is going to take our democracy away from us. Not now, not ever.  America has come too far, fought too many battles, and endured too much to let that happen.
1324490426649317376 2020-11-05 15:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The people will not be silenced, be bullied, or surrender.  Every vote must be counted.
1324469173297303552 2020-11-05 13:50:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> I spent the afternoon attending briefings on the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and the state of the economy. Tune in as I provide an update on these briefings and efforts to count every vote.  https://t.co/duoDWfzf5C
1324467777470558208 2020-11-05 13:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I ask people to stay calm.  The process is working.  The count is being completed.
1324465078243151885 2020-11-05 13:34:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> Democracy is sometimes messy, so sometimes it requires a little patience.   But that patience has been rewarded now for more than 240 years with a system of governance that has been the envy of the world.
1324445128434438145 2020-11-05 12:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re fighting to ensure every last vote is counted across the country — and we need your help to do it. Chip in to the Biden Fight Fund to fuel our election protection efforts:  https://t.co/VsuxvtqAFa
1324430028860493826 2020-11-05 11:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be clear: I campaigned as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president.  https://t.co/Mv5hHI2Rb3
1324406121721786369 2020-11-05 09:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Be patient, folks. Votes are being counted, and we feel good about where we are.
1324384344962592769 2020-11-05 08:13:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> As votes continue to be counted across the country, tune in as my campaign manager @jomalleydillon and campaign adviser Bob Bauer give an update on where things stand.  https://t.co/sKReFhHU5j
1324341948568621056 2020-11-05 05:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every vote must be counted.  https://t.co/kWLGRfeePK
1324187178688196609 2020-11-04 19:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump does not decide the outcome of this election and nor do I. The American people decide. That’s why we’ve launched the Biden Fight Fund — to ensure every vote is counted.  Chip in to help fund our election protection efforts across the country:  https://t.co/ps6VhGy0m5
1324179628932562944 2020-11-04 18:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m confident that we will emerge victorious.  But this will not be my victory alone.  It will be a victory for the American people.  https://t.co/ZqJBVsQuQf
1324172079025934336 2020-11-04 18:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s clear that when the count is finished, we believe we will be the winners.  https://t.co/qVk0igZlrF
1324158992877154310 2020-11-04 17:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, the Trump Administration officially left the Paris Climate Agreement. And in exactly 77 days, a Biden Administration will rejoin it.
1324136846826364929 2020-11-04 15:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Keep faith in the process and in each other. Together, we will win this.
1324115456190459911 2020-11-04 14:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I am confident we will emerge victorious, but this will not be my victory or our victory alone. It will be a victory for the American people, for our democracy, for America.
1324112939310264322 2020-11-04 14:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as enemies. We are not enemies.
1324110423411490816 2020-11-04 14:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Once this election is finalized and behind us, it will be time for us to do what we've always done as Americans: To put the harsh rhetoric of the campaign behind us.
1324107906246086656 2020-11-04 13:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every vote must be counted. No one is going to take our democracy away from us, not now, not ever.
1324105390049488896 2020-11-04 13:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The presidency, itself, is not a partisan institution. It's the one office in the nation that represents everyone and it demands a duty of care for all Americans, and that is precisely what I will do.
1324103124768882689 2020-11-04 13:36:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Power can't be taken or asserted, it flows from the people, and it's their will that determines who will be the President of the United States.

1323867320826109954 2020-11-03 21:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's not my place or Donald Trump's place to declare the winner of this election. It's the voters' place.

1323516509491138562 2020-11-02 22:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president.  I will work with Democrats and Republicans, and I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as for those who do.  Because that’s the job of a president.
1323512734781067265 2020-11-02 22:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Under President Trump:  - Over 230,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 - 30 million people have lost hours, paychecks, or jobs - Nearly one in five small businesses have closed  Are you better off than you were four years ago?
1323508959706292224 2020-11-02 22:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I will:  – Rebuild our infrastructure – Combat climate change – Create millions of good-paying, union jobs  It’s time to build back better –– together.  https://t.co/Mb9dvTcuKH
1323505184841080832 2020-11-02 22:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we give Donald Trump another four years in the White House, our planet will never recover.

1323491343709036546 2020-11-02 21:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe health care is a right for all.  Donald Trump believes it's a privilege for the few.  It's that simple, folks.

1323463661235642369 2020-11-02 19:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump will always fight for his wealthy and well-connected friends. I’ll always fight for you.

1323454098025320448 2020-11-02 18:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump ignored the pandemic playbook that President Obama and I left him, so we decided to bring it back out and go over what he missed.  https://t.co/ZHq5OCZwaN

1323409554567094272 2020-11-02 15:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern history.  Donald Trump is the most racist president in modern history.  Donald Trump is the worst jobs president in modern history.  Why would we give him another four years?
1323404521523982338 2020-11-02 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The power to change this country is in your hands.  Vote:  https://t.co/eoxT07uII9  https://t.co/fwxrJWjs7U
1323400746939883522 2020-11-02 15:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here’s the truth: Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he’s inherited in life, he squandered it.
1323391493885718528 2020-11-02 14:28:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m speaking with members of the African American community in Pittsburgh about the power of the vote — and the future we can build together. Tune in.  https://t.co/1wFBiLoCWu
1323383130435260419 2020-11-02 13:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When America votes, America will be heard. And when America is heard, I believe the message is going to be loud and clear: It’s time for Donald Trump to leave the White House.
1323376838874484738 2020-11-02 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A Biden-Harris administration will:  - Implement nationwide mask mandates - Ensure access to regular, reliable, and free testing - Accelerate the development and distribution of safe and effective treatments and vaccines  We won’t waste any time getting this virus under control.
1323373064277680128 2020-11-02 13:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Health care.  Civil rights. Climate change.  Economic inequality.  Racial justice. The Supreme Court. Our democracy.  They’re all at stake. Vote.  https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB
1323369292499484684 2020-11-02 13:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Together, we're going to rebuild our economy. And when we do, we'll not only build it back — we'll build it back better.

1323357964737089540 2020-11-02 12:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In public, President Trump compared COVID-19 to the flu and suggested people inject bleach to treat it.  In private, he told Bob Woodward it was deadlier than the flu and that he wanted to downplay it.  It’s unthinkable.
1323354189876125696 2020-11-02 12:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I have always believed you can define America in one word: possibilities. And I refuse to postpone those possibilities any longer.  There is so much we can achieve as a nation with Donald Trump out of the White House.
1323345575526297600 2020-11-02 11:25:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, to thank some of our incredible volunteers for all their hard work. Tune in — and then sign up to help:  https://t.co/VUXqFt8uvT  https://t.co/iufd7btpcO

1323306919461756930 2020-11-02 08:52:10 -0800 <JoeBiden> One day left — and we're leaving it all on the field. Tune in as we get out the vote in Cleveland.  https://t.co/GM62WxKTIc

1323297566726017024 2020-11-02 08:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Climate change isn't a hoax –– it's a threat to millions of Americans like Velma and Amirah.  We have to vote out Donald Trump tomorrow and take urgent action to combat this crisis.  https://t.co/Lg9fvFlVg9
1323291275613757442 2020-11-02 07:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is my commitment to you: We will make sure every American has access to a free and safe COVID-19 vaccine.
1323285487059042309 2020-11-02 07:27:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 1 day. Let’s win this thing.
1323281209267527680 2020-11-02 07:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> From climate change to racial justice — there is so much on the line in this election. So my team put together a generator to help you show your friends and family what you’re voting for. Head to  https://t.co/kdc4aQ0d2D to try it out.
1323273910981451778 2020-11-02 06:41:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If you can still vote early, then vote early today.  If you haven’t returned your absentee ballot yet, then return it today.  If you’re voting in-person tomorrow, then make your plan today.  Let’s end this — today.
1323267619416399872 2020-11-02 06:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My faith has been my anchor through highs and lows –– a guiding light that taught me the values of honesty, decency, and treating others with respect.  As president, it will continue to serve as a source of strength.  https://t.co/wIVS8Uga2d
1323262197573836805 2020-11-02 05:54:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> Don’t wait: Drop off your ballot today.   https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB
1323256294925455360 2020-11-02 05:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who actually listens to experts like Dr. Fauci.
1323252268481695744 2020-11-02 05:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If I have the honor of being elected president, I will take care of your family like I would my own.  https://t.co/MsIORKeVTF
1323244215187447814 2020-11-02 04:43:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I started this campaign saying we were in a battle for the soul of this nation — and I believe that even more deeply today.  But make no mistake: It’s a battle we can and will win.
1323238930339287045 2020-11-02 04:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our president has failed in his most basic duty to this nation: to protect us.  It’s unforgivable.
1323233897694470144 2020-11-02 04:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The hard truth is that our economy wasn't working for folks long before this crisis. It's why we can't just go back to the way things were — we have to build back better.  Here's how we'll do it:  https://t.co/rt5RD9Fdi0
1323228219127046144 2020-11-02 03:39:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> Vote for respect. Vote for decency. Vote for truth. Vote for leadership.   https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB

1323128955642253312 2020-11-01 21:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump sees the world from Park Avenue.  I see it from where I came from: Scranton, Pennsylvania.   It's why I'll fight every day as president to make this country work for middle class and low-income Americans — not just the wealthy and well-connected.
1323122502751653888 2020-11-01 20:39:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> No one fights harder for the people of Alabama than my friend, @DougJones. He's a Senator with a big heart and he's never afraid to fight for what's right.  Doug is in a tight race and needs your help to win on Tuesday. Chip in:  https://t.co/jwBbBDNZfH
1323117631033933825 2020-11-01 20:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I’ll protect and build on Obamacare by:   - Giving Americans the choice of a new public option - Lowering premiums, deductibles, and co-pays - Lowering the cost of prescription drugs  Learn more:  https://t.co/uw7Kk0ONHA
1323112598938767361 2020-11-01 20:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The United States of America has emerged stronger from every trial and tribulation it has faced. And if we come together, follow the science, and keep faith with each other, we will once again. I promise.
1323105048075792385 2020-11-01 19:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is the most important election in our lifetimes — and you have the power to make all the difference.  Vote.  https://t.co/eoxT07uII9
1323098757173448704 2020-11-01 19:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 2016 taught us to take nothing for granted and to leave everything on the field.  Vote:  https://t.co/eoxT07uII9  https://t.co/q4yiDddE2s
1323096239970373638 2020-11-01 18:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, he thinks “hoax.”   I think “jobs.”  We can solve our climate crisis and our economic crisis at the same time. Here’s how:  https://t.co/AKl9jZKB0s
1323087935411924993 2020-11-01 18:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is our moment to root out systemic racism and build a nation true to our founding ideals. A nation where all men and women are not only created equal — but treated equally.   Here's how we'll advance racial economic equity:  https://t.co/Tjgyn1gR2V
1323082401774329856 2020-11-01 18:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A more hopeful, united, and loving America is within our grasp –– but we have to vote for it.   https://t.co/eoxT07uII9  https://t.co/cxmNP5SKpH
1323077868990193672 2020-11-01 17:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump’s COVID-19 response has been the greatest failure of presidential leadership in our nation’s history.
1323073590749614080 2020-11-01 17:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> From Arizona to Georgia to Wisconsin and beyond — we’re working hard to earn every last vote.  https://t.co/mmfZspnLOU
1323069815880327173 2020-11-01 17:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Under my tax plan, no one making under $400,000 will see their taxes go up.  But it’s time large corporations and the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share.
1323062266200264705 2020-11-01 16:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I want to help restore hope in this country — and I have a bold vision for how, together, we can do that.  https://t.co/ZdW23fhad2

1323052200814366720 2020-11-01 16:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is trying to eliminate the entire Affordable Care Act in the middle of a pandemic.  If he gets his way, more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions could see their costs skyrocket or be denied coverage altogether.  We can’t let him win.  https://t.co/DoTV2uw1bn
1323048424929898501 2020-11-01 15:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s long past time President Trump and his wealthy friends paid their fair share in taxes.

1323018225895047179 2020-11-01 13:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump claimed he would be "the greatest jobs president God ever created."  Instead, he's on track to become the worst jobs president in 100 years.

1322989285377667073 2020-11-01 11:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe climate change is an existential threat to humanity.  Donald Trump doesn’t even think it exists.  It’s that simple, folks.

1322971669355483139 2020-11-01 10:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> More than 230,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 –– and Donald Trump has given up on trying to get the virus under control.  He may have quit on you, but I promise I never will.

1322952795033538560 2020-11-01 09:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Trump Administration knew how deadly this virus was back in February.  But they didn't tell you or your family. Instead, they gave a heads up to their friends on Wall Street so investors could make a profit before the recession hit.  They hid the truth. It's unforgivable.
1322949020164202497 2020-11-01 09:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president.  https://t.co/d5tmoNSnco

1322721017811345410 2020-10-31 19:04:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The hard truth is that under President Trump, we’ve become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided, and more violent.

1322519943167021056 2020-10-31 05:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump still has no plan to address COVID-19.  He quit on you, on your family, on America. He just wants us to grow numb to the horrors of the death toll and the pain.  We cannot afford another four years of his failed leadership.

1322356364828569602 2020-10-30 18:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> From the climate crisis to student debt and gun violence — there's so much on the line in this election, and young people have the power to own the outcome.

Mi administración luchará para asegurar la igualdad salarial que se merecen.
1321895830173945856 2020-10-29 12:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I are keeping the French people in our prayers following the horrific terror attack in Nice — which targeted innocents in a house of worship. A Biden-Harris administration will work with our allies and partners to prevent extremist violence in all forms.
1321889541343641601 2020-10-29 12:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My Catholic faith drilled into me a core truth — that every person on earth is equal in rights and dignity.

1321823865165778944 2020-10-29 07:39:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> Success in a Biden-Harris Administration will not be measured just by the stock market or GDP growth, but by the extent to which growth is raising the pay, dignity, and economic security of our working families—especially those who have been left behind.  https://t.co/HQZ8UbUb3f
1321823864213721094 2020-10-29 07:39:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> GDP rose last quarter, but visits to food banks haven’t slowed, and poverty has grown. We’re on track for the worst economic downturn in over 70 years, and Donald Trump is on track to be the first president since Herbert Hoover to leave office with less jobs than when he came in.

1321522117754658816 2020-10-28 11:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s hard to believe it’s been a year since we lost my friend Senator Kay Hagan. Kay was a relentless champion for North Carolina and a fierce defender of its citizens. May her legacy continue to inspire a new generation of leaders to follow in her steps.

1321491263334436864 2020-10-28 09:37:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> Under Donald Trump’s leadership, we have become weaker and sicker. Tune in as I discuss how I’ll get this virus under control and ensure every American has access to quality, affordable health care.  https://t.co/vm1d4F0oig

1321255611795951618 2020-10-27 18:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Two years ago, a white supremacist entered Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue and perpetrated the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history.

1320449802094714880 2020-10-25 12:39:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, with just nine days until Election Day, your support is more important than ever.  Every dollar counts during this final stretch.  If you're able, please chip in today:  https://t.co/zsgPxXrflF

1320417338026491904 2020-10-25 10:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The fact is Secretary Betsy DeVos and President Trump don't care about our students or our teachers.  You deserve better.  https://t.co/fMaCvYMu6u
1320401735534268416 2020-10-25 09:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The hard truth is it didn't have to be this bad. But Donald Trump's shortsighted actions weakened our ability to respond to a pandemic long before COVID-19 reached our shores.
1320394690789855233 2020-10-25 09:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s voting season, folks. Watch as @StaceyAbrams breaks down the importance of your vote — and then head to  https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB to make your voice heard today.  https://t.co/C6sfg5oI9Y

1320130447649636352 2020-10-24 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump continues to prove just how unfit he is to lead our nation through a global pandemic.
1320122899655634944 2020-10-24 15:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Imagine a day in the not too distant future when you can enjoy a dinner out with your friends, a night at the movies, or when you can celebrate your birthday, wedding, or graduation surrounded by your nearest and dearest.

1320081374448025600 2020-10-24 12:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump called India "filthy."  It's not how you talk about friends—and it's not how you solve global challenges like climate change.  @KamalaHarris and I deeply value our partnership—and will put respect back at the center of our foreign policy.  https://t.co/TKcyZiNwY6

1320041360771051522 2020-10-24 09:36:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On Thursday, President Trump said we're "rounding the turn" when it comes to COVID-19.  On Friday, we set a new record for daily cases.   We're paying the price for his failures every single day.
1320034854575181824 2020-10-24 09:10:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today marks the first-ever #VoteEarlyDay — and our campaign has set a big goal of talking to ten million people about voting early.  We can’t do it without you — sign up to help:  https://t.co/u4eKL4ivg8

1319740377486688257 2020-10-23 13:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A slight change of tone from the president for one night doesn’t cover up the lies he told. It doesn’t change the fact that over 220,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 on his watch.  We can’t take another four years of Donald Trump’s failed leadership.
1319732324616077315 2020-10-23 13:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 64 years ago today, freedom-loving Hungarians revolted against communist rule. Their spirit inspired the Prague Spring, Poland's Solidarity movement, and the fall of the Berlin Wall. As president, I'll always stand in defense of democracy and freedom at home and around the world.
1319723264927649792 2020-10-23 12:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> After eight months of this pandemic, we finally found President Trump's plan to beat COVID-19.  https://t.co/KO4g328Uvr

1319686774441058306 2020-10-23 10:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@BarackObama is right: President Trump wants full credit for the economy he inherited and zero blame for the pandemic he ignored.  https://t.co/tCD5UST32J

1319473619941031937 2020-10-22 20:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, I just stepped off the debate stage, and I’ve never been more fired up and ready to win this election.  Now, I need your help — chip in to keep tonight’s momentum going through Election Day:  https://t.co/9lrG3uFUIx
1319472613035528192 2020-10-22 19:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I will represent you — whether you vote for me or against me.
1319471858027122688 2020-10-22 19:53:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Decency, honor, respect, treating people with dignity, making sure that everyone has an even chance.  I'm going to make sure you get that. You haven't been getting it the last four years.  https://t.co/KhQIGGZHIH
1319469844920627201 2020-10-22 19:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the most racist president in modern history.  https://t.co/6GyKSbRoHA
1319468838195396608 2020-10-22 19:41:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You know who I am. You know who Donald Trump is.   The character of the country is on the ballot.  https://t.co/LdiIAOhHLj
1319468334845513729 2020-10-22 19:39:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There is institutional racism in America.  We have to give everyone a fair shot.  https://t.co/rB8qzFT8rR
1319465818300690433 2020-10-22 19:29:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Kids were ripped from their parents’ arms, and now they can't find their parents.  Those kids are alone. With nowhere to go.  It’s criminal.  https://t.co/HsfQayx3ZV
1319464056621813765 2020-10-22 19:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump has a dog whistle about as big as a foghorn.
1319463301995266048 2020-10-22 19:19:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You know who I am. You know who he is.  The character of the country is on the ballot. Look at us closely.
1319461625427099651 2020-10-22 19:12:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> Equality and justice — the American creed. We have never lived up to it, but we’ve never stopped trying — until this President.
1319460281936793600 2020-10-22 19:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Call it Bidencare.  https://t.co/Ng3Fvk4fpY
1319459778989469696 2020-10-22 19:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This isn’t about Donald Trump’s family or my family. This is about your family.  Families across America are hurting — but that’s the last thing Donald Trump wants to talk about.  https://t.co/qWMgnLHxKY
1319458523177156610 2020-10-22 19:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> All Donald Trump can see from Park Avenue is Wall Street.  He thinks the economy is doing well if the Dow Jones is doing well.  Believe it or not, Mr. President, most Americans don't live off the stock market.
1319458227160076292 2020-10-22 18:58:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> He’s a confused guy. He doesn’t know who he’s running against. He’s running against Joe Biden.
1319457010312675333 2020-10-22 18:54:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’ve been waiting years for President Trump to reveal his grand plan for health care, and he still has nothing to show.  I’ve laid out exactly what I’ll do. Take a look:  https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C
1319456758734225414 2020-10-22 18:53:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I have released all of my tax returns. 22 years. Go look at them.  What is Donald Trump hiding?  https://t.co/2TNt0z1QMw
1319455248868663296 2020-10-22 18:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s not about his family or my family. It’s about your family.  If you’re a middle-class family right now, you’re hurting badly.
1319454865286926336 2020-10-22 18:45:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> Malarkey!
1319453990325661698 2020-10-22 18:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I don’t see our country in terms of blue states and red states. We are the United States.  https://t.co/7G5IXGA9fu
1319452732114259970 2020-10-22 18:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump should release his tax returns or shut up about corruption.
1319452480451694593 2020-10-22 18:36:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I am proud that the average contribution to my campaign is $43.  Chip in to power our grassroots movement through this final stretch:  https://t.co/foyJuIKiYo

1319448963443982337 2020-10-22 18:22:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m going to shut down the virus, not the country.
1319448453911441408 2020-10-22 18:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Learning to live with it? Come on. People are dying with it, Mr. President.
1319446692236791814 2020-10-22 18:13:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 220,000 deaths.  If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this: Anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain President of the United States.
1319435367653593088 2020-10-22 17:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ready.  https://t.co/RYbnSpEsKB

1319420772469727232 2020-10-22 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, the final debate is here. Tune in at 9 PM ET as I go head-to-head with Donald Trump for the last time before Election Day.
1319410705364373505 2020-10-22 15:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump sees the world from Park Avenue.  I see it from where I came from: Scranton, Pennsylvania.   It's why I'll fight every day as president to make this country work for the middle class — not the wealthy and well-connected.
1319392082436476930 2020-10-22 14:36:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m running as a proud Democrat. But I will be an American president.
1319367926483476481 2020-10-22 13:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m always talking about my plans to build back better for all Americans. But what does that really mean for you and your family?   Watch as @ewarren helps explain:  https://t.co/ti7QJCU7j0
1319349804099653633 2020-10-22 11:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On this International Stuttering Awareness Day, I want everyone to remember that the barriers you face don't define who you are. They didn't for me –– as a young boy who stuttered –– and they certainly don't for Brayden.  What defines you is your heart and your courage.  https://t.co/zoVPzmroJh
1319346532584288256 2020-10-22 11:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, it's go-time. This is the most important election of our lifetimes — and you can make all the difference.  Vote.  https://t.co/eoxT07uII9

1319294943110729730 2020-10-22 08:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve spent my entire career fighting for the middle class and standing up to the abuse of power.  Donald Trump has spent his entire career looking out for himself and abusing his power.  https://t.co/Vie5CP9wq7

1319247631089094657 2020-10-22 05:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, you heard @BarackObama: Make a plan, vote early, and make sure your friends and family do as well.   https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB  https://t.co/deCh7bW9IS
1319117774916997121 2020-10-21 20:26:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> “If we pour all our efforts into these 13 days, if we vote up and down the ticket like never before, then we will not only elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, we will also leave no doubt about what this country that we love stands for.” — @BarackObama   https://t.co/eoxT07uII9  https://t.co/EOmHJ4wrnD
1319090595814670336 2020-10-21 18:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America was an idea. We've never lived up to it but we've never walked away from it before.   https://t.co/VRCnKI0rfQ  https://t.co/xLuhhGyJVp

1319054608916901891 2020-10-21 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump didn't take the necessary precautions to protect himself and others.  How can we trust him to protect the country?
1319032499456987136 2020-10-21 14:47:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> I couldn’t be more excited to have my friend @BarackObama hitting the campaign trail. Tune in for his first drive-in rally live from Philadelphia.  https://t.co/NJyChqivOt
1319021893446492162 2020-10-21 14:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s time we replace Secretary Betsy DeVos with an actual public school educator — one who values our public schools and is capable of guiding all of our schools through this pandemic.  Vote:  https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB

1318984450328399873 2020-10-21 11:36:13 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day it seems we uncover new horrors perpetrated by President Trump and his administration.
1318960740657672193 2020-10-21 10:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Build Back Better Express Tour was about more than my love for trains — it was about meeting folks along the way and discussing how we can make their lives better.  They are the backbone of America — and I’ll fight for them every day in the White House.  https://t.co/HhJHo35DvD
1318937589097717760 2020-10-21 08:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Justice is on the ballot.   https://t.co/eoxT07uII9  https://t.co/0dg9Cg1f2i

1318753877076881408 2020-10-20 20:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s time we see each other as fellow Americans who live in — and love — the United States of America.  https://t.co/xawem14X61
1318714870024540160 2020-10-20 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve always believed we’re at our best when we’re one America. If we come together, there’s not a single thing we cannot overcome.
1318701028997517314 2020-10-20 16:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If I’m elected president, I won’t waste a minute getting this virus under control. Here’s how I’ll do it:  https://t.co/NoPsQ0FDV8
1318691465959268353 2020-10-20 16:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Whether it’s your first time voting or you’re an old pro, voting is better with friends and family. So message a few folks and make your plan to vote together today.   https://t.co/uoiVh9ZqzI  https://t.co/clVe9wpOMi
1318674605192761350 2020-10-20 15:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Listening to scientists is not a bad thing.  I can’t believe that has to be said.
1318654724057518080 2020-10-20 13:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America is a nation that values immigrants. It is and has always been one of our greatest strengths.  We need a president who understands that.  https://t.co/fIuNJUrfY3
1318638114429173767 2020-10-20 12:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A few weeks ago, I spoke to Mr. Rogers’ wife Joanne when I was in her neighborhood in Pittsburgh. It was a great conversation.  Friendship, empathy, kindness, and compassion — I think we could all learn a thing or two from her and her husband’s example.  https://t.co/lRX9jt7FXS
1318627796365856768 2020-10-20 11:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight, the Avengers are assembling with real-life superhero @KamalaHarris for a grassroots fundraiser.  Time is running out to join them. Chip in to reserve your spot:  https://t.co/kLqUKmDCjK  https://t.co/3wL1zcFFd6
1318609173727281155 2020-10-20 10:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Two weeks from today, we’re going to beat President Trump.
1318598926262480898 2020-10-20 10:04:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mr. President, the people are tired. They’re tired of your lies about this virus. They’re tired of watching more Americans die, and more people lose their jobs because you refuse to take this pandemic seriously.  https://t.co/pdxdo3FadB
1318598925075566592 2020-10-20 10:04:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> Waving a white flag and saying, “it is what it is” is unacceptable when thousands are dying each week, when businesses are closing, and when schools remain shuttered. The American people have never backed down from a challenge, but they need a leader to show the way.
1318598924131860481 2020-10-20 10:04:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> Yesterday, @realDonaldTrump decided to attack Dr. Fauci once again, calling him a ‘disaster’ and public health experts ‘idiots.’ Meanwhile, he still has no plan to beat this virus.
1318585266542538754 2020-10-20 09:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Happy Birthday, @KamalaHarris. Next year, let’s celebrate with some ice cream at the White House.  https://t.co/SWhS32AaIE

1318561610235981824 2020-10-20 07:36:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The simple, sad truth is that this president is not in office to serve the American people. He’s in it to serve himself.  @KamalaHarris and I are in this for you and your families.  https://t.co/mV9ONHhn1b

1318352230458609664 2020-10-19 17:44:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I will be a president who pushes towards the future. Not one who clings to the past.
1318342919305166850 2020-10-19 17:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@realDonaldTrump — if you had listened to the scientists, it wouldn't be this bad.  https://t.co/0eNuV4pAMK

1318322534937395200 2020-10-19 15:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in a battle for the soul of this nation — and it’s a battle we can and must win.  Vote.  https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB

1318266163726487558 2020-10-19 12:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This election is about so much more than policies. The soul of America is on the ballot.   @KamalaHarris and I will work every day to bind up our wounds and bring this country back together.  https://t.co/hsy8JIIAqk
1318237222764642304 2020-10-19 10:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s long past time we build an economy that rewards work — not wealth.  https://t.co/rm9AK6rBxW
1318216587212582913 2020-10-19 08:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Together, we can put an end to the last four years of darkness, division, and chaos.  We can unite, mend our wounds, and begin to heal.  It starts at the ballot box:  https://t.co/eoxT07uII9  https://t.co/bmpMpedpdQ
1318182614570692608 2020-10-19 06:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 15 days. Let’s finish strong.
1318170176660135936 2020-10-19 05:40:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> ...yes
1317993870257389568 2020-10-18 18:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You have the power to own the outcome of this election — but only if you vote.  Head to  https://t.co/eoxT07uII9 and make your plan to cast your ballot today.

1317966186907226113 2020-10-18 16:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve had a rule my entire life: No matter what’s happening, no matter how important the meeting, I’ll always answer a call from my grandchildren.  https://t.co/mmsB1GOxAu
1317952345544794112 2020-10-18 15:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in a battle for the soul of the nation.   The forces of darkness, the forces of division, the forces of yesterday are pulling us apart, holding us down, and holding us back.  We must free ourselves of all of them.
1317942279353454592 2020-10-18 14:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe there is not a single thing we cannot accomplish as a country if we do it together.  https://t.co/suxrTITkTm
1317934981432430592 2020-10-18 14:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The truth is things in life are easier when you have a plan — and that includes voting. So my team set up a tool to help you make your plan to vote. Check it out:  https://t.co/uoiVh9ZqzI
1317918374341476353 2020-10-18 13:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> From tackling climate change to making community college free for all — I've got big plans for the country.  And I'll pay for them by making sure the super-wealthy, like President Trump, pay more than $750 in federal income taxes.
1317907047099191297 2020-10-18 12:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve spent my entire career fighting for a more just, safe, and prosperous America — and I’m not finished yet.  https://t.co/cS3LPT7afX
1317895724105895939 2020-10-18 11:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> COVID-19 cases are on the rise across the nation.  But instead of leading by example, Donald Trump continues to put others in danger with his campaign events that ignore expert-recommended precautions.  Every day he proves just how unfit he is to lead America through this crisis.
1317881721111539719 2020-10-18 10:34:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m in Durham, North Carolina, encouraging folks to make their plan to vote early. Tune in — and then head to  https://t.co/uoiVh9HPb8 to make yours.  https://t.co/lNw7Jxuh65

1317865525012131841 2020-10-18 09:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Chip in to help us make Donald Trump a one-term president:  https://t.co/JR9S8cVokb
1317844887614771200 2020-10-18 08:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Turns out Twitter isn’t so bad when you read tweets that aren’t from President Trump.  https://t.co/ZKA2dwZQks
1317832808254083072 2020-10-18 07:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I often think about what it takes for a Black person to love America. That is a deep love for this country that, for far too long, has not been recognized.  It’s time we fulfilled our nation’s founding promise: equality for all.   Here’s how we’ll do it:  https://t.co/wH2hVq7UL2
1317623931914813444 2020-10-17 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A job is about a lot more than a paycheck.  It's about dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything will be okay.  Too many people today can't do that — and it's got to change.
1317605057215500289 2020-10-17 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day we're reminded just how much is at stake in this election. We can't afford to have anyone sit on the sidelines.  Vote.  https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB
1317589957704355843 2020-10-17 15:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the middle of a pandemic, President Trump is trying to eliminate Obamacare and increase health care costs for millions.  Now, he’s rushing through a U.S. Supreme Court justice to help him get it done. It’s unconscionable.   Make no mistake: Health care is on the ballot.
1317574858302128129 2020-10-17 14:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we do our part, if we stand together, if we keep faith with the past and with each other — then the divisions of our time can give way to the dreams of a brighter, better future.   That is our work. That is our pledge. That is our mission.
1317554725596942336 2020-10-17 12:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Promise?  https://t.co/Wbl86i8uYo
1317545917776564224 2020-10-17 12:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This election is bigger than any one candidate.   It's about the future of our economy, our health care, our climate, our commitment to racial justice, our democracy –– and so much more.  We have to vote.  https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB
1317525784836382721 2020-10-17 11:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I’ll protect and build on Obamacare by:  - Giving Americans the choice to buy a new public option - Lowering premiums, deductibles, and co-pays - Standing up to prescription drug corporations  We’re going to make sure every American has access to the care they need.
1317510433851412482 2020-10-17 09:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You deserve a president who will actually tell you the truth.  https://t.co/I9XzZ0ADmT

1317472937159610373 2020-10-17 07:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As the Hindu festival of Navratri begins, Jill and I send our best wishes to all those celebrating in the U.S. and around the world. May good once again triumph over evil — and usher in new beginnings and opportunity for all.
1317465638953168899 2020-10-17 07:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’ve got to come together to defeat Donald Trump –– Democrats, Independents, Republicans, and yes, even Demo-cats.  https://t.co/LtsTWy7MmI
1317262047420190720 2020-10-16 17:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, millions of you have already requested absentee ballots. It’s essential to return your ballots as soon as you can. You can return your ballot by mail or, in most states, at locations designated by your clerk. Head to  https://t.co/eoxT07uII9 to learn more.  https://t.co/ULvjzpb8PZ
1317252484071624708 2020-10-16 16:54:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Violence against transgender and gender non-conforming people — particularly Black and Brown transgender women — is an epidemic that needs national leadership. But Donald Trump has done nothing but fan the flames of transphobia.  It has to end.  https://t.co/v2DAbcIcCv
1317243927817113600 2020-10-16 16:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s be clear: The emergency aid should have never been denied in the first place.
1317230581994811392 2020-10-16 15:26:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> The election is underway across the country, and millions of Americans have already cast their ballots. I’m in Detroit, Michigan, to encourage folks to join them and vote early. Tune in.  https://t.co/8QXlDNjKzi
1317226311669014528 2020-10-16 15:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Not only does President Trump refuse to grant Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans, but he also apparently used stealth deportations to send them back to the oppressive Maduro regime.  It’s abundantly clear he has no regard for the suffering of the Venezuelan people.
1317216245679378432 2020-10-16 14:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You have the power to prevent 2016 from happening again — but only if you vote.   https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB  https://t.co/ujWChoXpYK
1317202907444334592 2020-10-16 13:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who will expand access to health care — not one who does everything he can to tear it away.
1317187255019077632 2020-10-16 12:34:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t let President Trump tear down Obamacare — we have to protect and build on it. Tune in as I speak live from Michigan about my plans to give more Americans access to affordable health care.  https://t.co/RZ8hakbLbe
1317162642142875654 2020-10-16 10:57:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know times are tough, but I promise our best days still lie ahead. Together, we're going to overcome these crises, unite the country, and build a better future for all.
1317151066035802112 2020-10-16 10:11:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The cast of Hamilton knows we're engaged in a battle for this nation's very soul — and this election is too important to sit out.

1316920798406451205 2020-10-15 18:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If I'm elected president, you won't hear me race-baiting, you won't hear me dividing — you'll hear me trying to unify.  https://t.co/PNsBW8OQmX
1316920043553378305 2020-10-15 18:53:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> How will I ensure the rights of LGBTQ+ people are protected under U.S. law?  I’ll change the law.
1316917275354669061 2020-10-15 18:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to heal this nation.  https://t.co/wD45ZGcKO2
1316915010606514176 2020-10-15 18:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm going to be an American president.   I'm going to take care of those who voted against me as well as those who voted for me.   That's what presidents do.
1316914003646517249 2020-10-15 18:29:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're a diverse country — and unless we are able to treat people equally, we're just never going to meet our potential.
1316907209465290752 2020-10-15 18:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, I hope I’m making you proud during tonight’s town hall.  If you’re with us, please chip in to help power our campaign over these final 19 days.  https://t.co/rA9WmMPRxs
1316903434168172551 2020-10-15 17:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Two of the things I've cared about throughout my whole career:  1. Improving the criminal justice system. 2. Putting Black Americans in a position to gain generational wealth.  And as president, I will continue that fight every day.
1316899408315772928 2020-10-15 17:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The words of a president matter.  https://t.co/ABrbg5xTkg
1316896639416561666 2020-10-15 17:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be very clear: If you make under $400,000 you won’t pay a penny more in taxes under my administration.
1316896136116891649 2020-10-15 17:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The words of a president matter. And when a president doesn't wear a mask or makes fun of folks who do, it has consequences.
1316894877649653761 2020-10-15 17:13:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Over 215,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, and what is President Trump doing?  Nothing.
1316894374500962305 2020-10-15 17:11:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're eight months into this pandemic, and Donald Trump still doesn't have a plan to get this virus under control.  I do.
1316888334594007040 2020-10-15 16:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m about to step on stage for tonight’s town hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Tune in to @ABC to watch live.
1316881791425212417 2020-10-15 16:21:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is not a moment — it's a movement.  Rise up and be a part of it with the original cast of Hamilton.  Chip in to join:  https://t.co/YtCDSeBN01
1316854109270503426 2020-10-15 14:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Well, folks, @KamalaHarris and I watched some of President Trump’s remarks from the campaign trail — and it went just as you’d imagine. We wanted to take a moment to clear up some of the lies he’s been saying about us.  https://t.co/QWqXp3qdSD
1316840806502760448 2020-10-15 13:38:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our campaign’s contact tracing remains ongoing, and my team will continue to share any significant developments with the American people. If anything, let this serve as an example of the importance of wearing masks and keeping a safe, social distance.
1316840627817066496 2020-10-15 13:37:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> Not only was the individual 50+ feet away and wearing a mask, but I was wearing an N-95 mask. No members of my staff were in contact with this crew member either.  My doctors have advised that there is no need for me to quarantine.
1316840452235186178 2020-10-15 13:36:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> During our contact tracing, we discovered around noon today that a member of the company that charters my airplane has also tested positive for COVID. This crew member was on the plane with me, but was more than 50 feet away.   My COVID test from last night came back negative.
1316831214821548033 2020-10-15 13:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is rushing through Justice Ginsburg's replacement because he's laser-focused on destroying the Affordable Care Act.   Here's what's at stake:  https://t.co/W7kluAVe2l
1316819884081393667 2020-10-15 12:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Obama and I left Donald Trump a booming economy — and he caused a recession. He squandered it just like he has everything else he’s inherited in his life.
1316808561435967488 2020-10-15 11:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Nevada — today is the last day to register to vote online to automatically receive a ballot in the mail. Head to  https://t.co/ajJjiHyWD2 for all the information you need to make your voice heard.
1316801009184722945 2020-10-15 11:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump can lie about the economy all he wants, but the truth is he’s the worst jobs president since 1929.  https://t.co/lShe254BEG
1316792201213407232 2020-10-15 10:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This #SpiritDay — and every day — we must stand up to hate and intolerance. It’s up to all of us to ensure every young person is affirmed and accepted just as they are — regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression.

1316736837524713472 2020-10-15 06:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The fact that Senate Republicans haven’t bothered to pass a COVID relief package but are rushing through President Trump’s Supreme Court pick says all you need to know.  We’ve got to flip the Senate, folks.
1316572503616094208 2020-10-14 19:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I heard it's #NationalDessertDay  https://t.co/RtBhurORwR

1316506571082522626 2020-10-14 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If President Trump has his way in the U.S. Supreme Court, long-term complications from COVID-19, like lung scarring and heart damage, will become pre-existing conditions that could result in higher premiums or denied coverage.  It’s unconscionable.
1316493986295504897 2020-10-14 14:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There's only one way to end this horror: Vote.   https://t.co/eoxT07uII9  https://t.co/3RTLmdyzMa

1316463787579502596 2020-10-14 12:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today would have been George Floyd’s 47th birthday, and he should be alive to celebrate it.  I made a promise to his family that I won’t let him become just another hashtag — and I’ll work every day as president to keep that promise.
1316446172521795584 2020-10-14 11:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight, our campaign will close our books and send in the names of our grassroots supporters for the final time.   Chip in to make sure you’re on the list:  https://t.co/ff1FGgz3yE

1316417230670721024 2020-10-14 09:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump wants to destroy Obamacare.  I want to protect and build on it.  It’s that simple, folks.
1316402131197452288 2020-10-14 08:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If President Trump is successful in forcing through his nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, it will likely repeal the ACA and 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions will lose their protections.   Vote like your health care depends on it. Because it does.  https://t.co/XgY2aGRZq2

1316178155510652929 2020-10-13 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ll be a president for all Americans. Not just the ones who vote for me.
1316163055760232449 2020-10-13 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, it’s hard to believe, but tomorrow night marks our final public fundraising deadline of the campaign.  Can you chip in to help us post our strongest numbers yet?  https://t.co/OZNNVP6VM6
1316155757511966721 2020-10-13 16:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here's something that will be very different if I'm president: I'll actually listen to Dr. Fauci's advice and expertise, not attack him for telling the truth.
1316147956689575936 2020-10-13 15:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We all know President Trump has a tendency to stray from the truth, so let's set the record straight.  https://t.co/hMtEkvECQR
1316137386628313088 2020-10-13 15:03:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The election is already underway.  Millions of Americans are voting.   And they deserve to have their voices heard when it comes to who serves on the U.S. Supreme Court.
1316126788972552192 2020-10-13 14:20:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> With just three weeks until Election Day, I’m in Miramar, Florida, to encourage folks to make their plan to vote. Tune in — and then head to  https://t.co/uoiVh9HPb8 to make your plan today.  https://t.co/5xzlVvl8xe
1316110207366250496 2020-10-13 13:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 215,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 on Donald Trump’s watch.   It’s the greatest failure of presidential leadership in our nation’s history.
1316090743925030912 2020-10-13 11:57:39 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m in Pembroke Pines, Florida, to discuss my plans to protect and strengthen Social Security and ensure every American can retire with dignity. Tune in.  https://t.co/Yo5dzpgDyZ

1316027160075866112 2020-10-13 07:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump has been trying to throw out Obamacare for years.  And now he sees an opportunity to finally get it done, all while ignoring the will of the people.  We can’t let him.
1316009544481345541 2020-10-13 06:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Three weeks from today, we’re going to make Donald Trump a one-term president.
1315823316960120833 2020-10-12 18:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I am ready to fight for you and for our nation. Every day. Without exception, without reservation. And with a full and devoted heart.
1315808217620860930 2020-10-12 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who will unite our country and bring out our best — not one who stokes division and brings out our worst.
1315798151375187968 2020-10-12 16:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, we're just a few days away from our final public fundraising deadline, and we need your help to hit our goal.  Every donation — big or small — makes a big difference during these final weeks.  If you're able, please chip in:  https://t.co/GQKCKd8oNV
1315791859919122433 2020-10-12 16:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On National Farmers Day, we honor the hardworking men and women who drive our economy, fuel our rural communities, and nourish our nation. A Biden-Harris administration will work every day to restore the dignity our farmers deserve and help them build back better than before.
1315784310016761857 2020-10-12 15:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today marks 22 years since Matthew Shepard passed away after a brutal anti-gay hate crime. Over two decades later, violence against LGBTQ+ Americans is at an all-time high. As president, I'll strengthen our hate crimes laws and make clear that bigotry has no place in America.
1315768965281447936 2020-10-12 14:39:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> There's no question: we are neck and neck in Ohio — and with early voting underway and only 22 days until Election Day, there's no time to waste. Join us live from Cincinnati as we get out the vote:  https://t.co/oMwv9s2sLE
1315768958742491136 2020-10-12 14:39:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is running TV ads taking Dr. Fauci out of context and without his permission.  So, here’s a message from the President in his own words.  https://t.co/WCYbIfrQLR
1315745051515908096 2020-10-12 13:04:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The longer Donald Trump is president, the more reckless he gets.
1315719382182526976 2020-10-12 11:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know Americans aren’t looking for a handout. They just want a fair chance to get ahead — and I’ll work every day to make sure folks get that chance.
1315706973661265920 2020-10-12 10:32:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm in Toledo, Ohio, to discuss my plans to build the economy back better for working families. Tune in.  https://t.co/MXlsFdS3Xt

1315678865268772865 2020-10-12 08:41:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On this Indigenous People’s Day, we must both recognize the past that has brought us here, and commit to one another to write a new future of promise, partnership, and equal opportunity for the proud Tribal Nations of our country.  https://t.co/7bOkPVCJc3
1315657223004065792 2020-10-12 07:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Health care is deeply personal to me. And I guarantee you that if I'm elected president, I will protect your family's health care as if it were my own.  https://t.co/wmIpmg1EcT
1315449605098799104 2020-10-11 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> From Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall, we’re at our best when the promise of America is available to all.
1315437021570248704 2020-10-11 16:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Brayden — you have heart, courage, and maturity beyond your years. You have unlimited potential — and I can't wait to see what your future holds.  https://t.co/7t2mHOXNMa
1315423180257808385 2020-10-11 15:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This election, you have the power to choose:  Hope over fear. Truth over lies. Unity over division.  Vote.  https://t.co/eoxT07uII9
1315404306258903040 2020-10-11 14:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I helped pull this country out of a recession before — and, as president, I’ll do it again.
1315389206991122432 2020-10-11 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In January, I said President Trump was the worst possible leader to deal with a public health crisis. And everything we’ve been through in the months since has proven that to be true.  https://t.co/twcy3Ql0Xc
1315374108218064896 2020-10-11 12:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When President Trump was told one thousand Americans were dying every day from COVID-19, he shrugged it off and said, "it is what it is."  It is what it is?  This president doesn't even pretend to care about the Americans he swore to serve. It's disgraceful.
1315343909346779136 2020-10-11 10:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today we join Polish-Americans in celebrating General Pulaski, whose heroism built the American cavalry and saved the life of George Washington. America will always stand with the Polish people against the common threats we face.
1315333841767354368 2020-10-11 09:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, let's all celebrate the one billion girls and young women around the world — and recommit to fight for their education, work, health, rights, and opportunities. A Biden-Harris administration will work to elevate their voices and ensure an equal future. #DayOfTheGirl
1315321762524127240 2020-10-11 09:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I want every member of the LGBTQ+ community to know you are loved and accepted just as you are — whether you've come out or not. I'll fight every day in the White House to create a country where you can live open, proud, and free — without fear. #NationalComingOutDay
1315311696022437888 2020-10-11 08:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There is no excuse for President Trump’s reckless behavior.  https://t.co/ooUh6pxRDt
1315079668463284224 2020-10-10 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> One in five small businesses have closed. More than 25 million Americans are on unemployment. Millions are at risk of losing their homes.  But President Trump doesn’t seem to care. He only cares about how he and his wealthy friends are doing.
1315064572940877826 2020-10-10 16:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> America has to be about the possibilities of prosperity.   Not just for the privileged few. But for the many — for all of us.
1315046951440838656 2020-10-10 14:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The fact is this pandemic has exposed the cracks in our already broken mental health care system.  We can and must do better.  As president, I’ll fight to achieve mental health parity, expand access to care, and wipe out the stigma. #WorldMentalHealthDay
1315033249186414592 2020-10-10 13:55:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m in Erie, Pennsylvania, to discuss my plans to build back better. Tune in.  https://t.co/8NqGra1egn
1315024302278955011 2020-10-10 13:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're eight months into this crisis, and this president still has no plan to rebuild our economy.  I do. I'll get America back to work — and build back better.  Here's how:  https://t.co/XjiTnHDiUk
1315011720709050368 2020-10-10 12:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s go vote, America.   https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB  https://t.co/Nso0pXH7ER
1314985295180259329 2020-10-10 10:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who understands hardworking Americans — not one who looks down on them.
1314970950484594689 2020-10-10 09:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> What does building back better mean for you?  - Millions of new, good-paying jobs - A $15 federal minimum wage - Stronger benefits and fair workplaces - An economy that works for everyone—not just the wealthy - The choice to join a union  That's the future we can build together.
1314949308194729985 2020-10-10 08:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If you're sick, struggling, or worried about how you're going to get through the day — know you are not alone.  We're all in this together. And together, we'll emerge stronger than before.  https://t.co/ztiKctOcHW

1314922380528095232 2020-10-10 06:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Over 213,000 Americans have died from this virus — and the hard truth is it didn’t have to happen this way.  https://t.co/27TL7PAhCi

1314694629720092672 2020-10-09 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> John — and farmers across the country — can’t afford four more years of a climate change denier in the White House.  https://t.co/Nnv3XPdDlx

1314658139715915777 2020-10-09 13:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s estimated that nearly another 200,000 Americans could lose their lives by the end of the year because of this virus.  Enough. No more.  Let’s set the partisanship aside. Let’s end the politics. Let’s follow the science.
1314639768227966977 2020-10-09 11:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Why did Donald Trump tell Bob Woodward the truth about COVID-19, but not the American people?
1314620390682091531 2020-10-09 10:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, if you live in:  Idaho New York North Carolina Oklahoma  Today is your last day to register to vote. Head to  https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB and get registered before it’s too late.  https://t.co/1VCz0wqEdP
1314608059482865667 2020-10-09 09:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congratulations to the UN World Food Program. With global hunger on the march, made worse by the pandemic and conflict around the world, we must come together to fight food insecurity. As president, I'll support the WFP and reassert American leadership to address global hunger.
1314583396970979328 2020-10-09 08:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 25 days. Let’s win this thing.
1314570059017334786 2020-10-09 07:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> What we need in America is leadership that seeks to de-escalate tensions, to open lines of communication, and to bring us together. To heal — and to hope.  As president, that is precisely what I will do.
1314393898333208578 2020-10-08 19:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When Governor Whitmer worked to protect her state from a deadly pandemic, President Trump issued a call to "LIBERATE MICHIGAN!"  That call was heard.  He's giving oxygen to the bigotry and hate we see on the march in our country — and we have to stop it.
1314373765388615682 2020-10-08 18:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I are keeping the Gulf Coast in our prayers tonight. If you’re in Hurricane Delta’s path, please heed the advice of local officials, take steps to prepare, and stay safe.
1314366215914098689 2020-10-08 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Time and time again, President Trump has refused to condemn white supremacy and stoked the flames of hate for political gain.  It’s a pattern — and America deserves better.  https://t.co/o1zKKd0bpf
1314358666045337602 2020-10-08 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@CP3 and @StephenCurry30 know exactly what it means to finish strong down the stretch.

1314355143022989314 2020-10-08 17:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> After last night, I just had to write a note about my friend and running mate, @KamalaHarris.  https://t.co/FYPXV5dZZG
1314346083087257603 2020-10-08 16:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@KamalaHarris is right: If you have a pre-existing condition, the Trump Administration is coming for you.  Vote like your health care depends on it — because it does.   https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB  https://t.co/Nf4IJZvL7U
1314337526694375426 2020-10-08 15:51:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Last night, @KamalaHarris chose truth over lies.  She chose hope and unity over fear and division.  She showed America what true leadership looks like — and I couldn't be prouder.
1314323701777657856 2020-10-08 14:56:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tune in as @KamalaHarris and I kick off our Soul of the Nation bus tour from Phoenix, Arizona.  https://t.co/0BukV7xBJq
1314320162317897729 2020-10-08 14:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every generation that has followed Gettysburg has been faced with a moment when it must answer this question: Will we allow the sacrifices made in that battle, and that war, to be in vain?   We cannot, and we must not. It's time to come together.  https://t.co/jmVGQRS4zy
1314300533071642625 2020-10-08 13:24:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, there was only one person on last night’s debate stage who’s fit to serve as Vice President — and her name is @KamalaHarris.
1314280652322336768 2020-10-08 12:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I promise you that as president, I will always appeal to the best in us — not the worst.  https://t.co/E07GuV4m7G
1314265301006118913 2020-10-08 11:04:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m running as a proud Democrat. But I will govern as an American president.  https://t.co/UgNPbQdNZH
1314246678153760771 2020-10-08 09:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must seek not to build walls, but bridges.  We must seek not to clench our fists, but to open our arms.  We must seek not to tear each other apart, but to come together.
1314229062324441089 2020-10-08 08:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Last night @KamalaHarris showed America exactly why she’ll make an incredible Vice President.  https://t.co/9BCqSUrl50
1314034535890378752 2020-10-07 19:47:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@KamalaHarris, you made us all proud tonight.

1314031047013732352 2020-10-07 19:33:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> Pitch in $5 to help this campaign fly.  https://t.co/CqHAId0j8t  https://t.co/NbkPl0a8HV
1314029053486211073 2020-10-07 19:25:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump has made hate, division, and dog whistles central to his campaign from the very beginning – and last week he couldn't even condemn white supremacists. It’s a pattern.
1314019962487529477 2020-10-07 18:49:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be clear: A Biden-Harris Administration won't increase taxes by a dime on anyone making less than $400,000 a year.
1314014722405150722 2020-10-07 18:28:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@KamalaHarris is showing the American people why I chose her as my running mate. She’s smart, she’s experienced, she’s a proven fighter for the middle class. She’ll be an incredible Vice President.
1314011006650273792 2020-10-07 18:13:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re eight months into this pandemic and Donald Trump and Mike Pence still have no plan to deal with COVID-19. He’s still hoping it will just “disappear.”  @KamalaHarris and I have a comprehensive, science-backed plan to defeat this virus.  Take a look:  https://t.co/xjxsDn2qCD
1314002569706917888 2020-10-07 17:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@KamalaHarris is about to take the debate stage –– but before she does, I need your help.  Will you chip in to make sure Kamala knows you’ve got her back as she takes on Vice President Pence?  https://t.co/QwFRpbMJVC

1313978662295949314 2020-10-07 16:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can end this era of division.  We can end the hate and the fear.  We can be what we are at our best: one America.  https://t.co/ZaUKw91eLZ

1313937641805496320 2020-10-07 13:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, I know a thing or two about vice presidential debates.  In 2008, I squared off against Governor Palin. And in 2012, I called out Congressman Ryan's malarkey.  I know @KamalaHarris will do a great job. Join me and tune in at 9 PM ET to cheer her on.
1313915747479945216 2020-10-07 11:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> These families fled persecution and violence to seek safety in the land of the free.  But instead of providing refuge, the Trump Administration ripped their children away from them.  The cruelty was the point — and it's reprehensible.

1313844025296789505 2020-10-07 07:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I will:  - Implement nationwide mask mandates - Ensure access to regular, reliable, and free testing - Accelerate the development of treatments and vaccines  I won’t waste any time getting this virus under control.
1313663334286323714 2020-10-06 19:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Please.  https://t.co/acHR1Rf8hE

1313641691602202624 2020-10-06 17:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Think about what it takes for a Black person to love America.   That is a deep love for this country that, for far too long, we have never recognized.  https://t.co/vTEY156VTj
1313633890289045504 2020-10-06 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Look, folks, I'm going to be honest: we'll try pretty much anything to get you to vote this election. My team spun up this quiz to match your personality to an easy voting option. Check it out — but more importantly, vote!  https://t.co/TH6ShPiapc
1313620049165336576 2020-10-06 16:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Four weeks from today, voters will head to the polls to determine the outcome of the most important election of our lifetime.  We don’t have a minute to waste — and we need your help to win. Chip in:  https://t.co/nx01UKHIyn
1313616274476285953 2020-10-06 16:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Climate change is already here, and ignoring science won't make it go away. If we give the Trump Administration another four years, we'll lose irreplaceable time to combat it.
1313612499263127552 2020-10-06 15:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Make no mistake: if you are out of work, if your business is closed, if your child’s school is shut down, if you are seeing layoffs in your community, Donald Trump decided today that none of that matters to him.
1313607969557282816 2020-10-06 15:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The President turned his back on you.  https://t.co/oeI8dck2LL
1313585320353509381 2020-10-06 14:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I give you my word: If I am elected president, I will marshal the ingenuity and goodwill of this nation to turn division into unity and bring us together.
1313583306932465664 2020-10-06 13:54:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I will embrace:  Hope, not fear. Peace, not violence. Generosity, not greed. Light, not darkness.   I will be a president who appeals to the best in us. Not the worst.
1313582803808903168 2020-10-06 13:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We fought a Civil War that would secure a Union that would seek to fulfill the promise of equality for all.  And by fits and starts, our better angels have prevailed just enough against our worst impulses to make a new and better nation.  Those better angels must prevail again.
1313582048691458048 2020-10-06 13:49:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The pandemic is not a red state versus blue state issue. The virus doesn’t care where you live or what political party you belong to.  It infects us all. It will take anyone’s life. It is a virus — not a political weapon.
1313581042066952192 2020-10-06 13:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I do not believe we have to choose between law and order and racial justice in America.
1313580790530351105 2020-10-06 13:44:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I will send a clear, unequivocal message to the entire nation: There is no place for hate in America.  It will be given no license. It will be given no oxygen. It will be given no safe harbor.
1313577195684556800 2020-10-06 13:29:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are engaged once again in a battle for the soul of the nation. It’s a battle we’ve been in before and we can win again. Tune in as I deliver remarks from Gettysburg.  https://t.co/I9KItf8Fjn
1313544299955417089 2020-10-06 11:19:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Unity over division.

1313276284093382658 2020-10-05 17:34:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When I decided to run, I had three objectives:  1. Restore the soul of this country. 2. Rebuild the middle class. 3. Reunite the country.  It's the only way we can move forward.  https://t.co/Wk3uP0Qcqm
1313275529064316928 2020-10-05 17:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> More than 200,000 Americans have died. 50,000 Americans are getting the virus every day. 1,000 a day are dying. This is a national emergency.  The President should take responsibility.  https://t.co/RpEZCjjUhq

1313273264010137600 2020-10-05 17:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I would hope that the President having gone through what he went through will communicate the right lesson to the American people: Masks matter. They save lives.  https://t.co/Hc8lovKEwB
1313272005701980160 2020-10-05 17:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I view wearing a mask as a patriotic duty — to protect those around you. #BidenTownHall
1313269992360681472 2020-10-05 17:09:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Masks matter. They save lives.

1313237533627645954 2020-10-05 15:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> These good boys are ready to build bark better.  https://t.co/OzaEkehJUR
1313228972126216193 2020-10-05 14:26:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Now that President Trump is busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this: Listen to the scientists. Support masks. Support mask mandates nationwide.

1313116739299762176 2020-10-05 07:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Imagine a future where:  - Health care is a right - We end the gun violence epidemic - We combat climate change - Our government works for everyone  It’s a future that we can build — together.
1312907856161705985 2020-10-04 17:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The economy. Climate change. Health care. Civil rights. Racial justice. The U.S. Supreme Court. Our democracy.  They’re all on the line. Vote.  https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB
1312883193939279872 2020-10-04 15:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s time we build an economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead. An economy more vibrant and powerful because everyone is in on the deal.  https://t.co/Tjgyn1gR2V
1312860293085753345 2020-10-04 14:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today marks 30 days until Election Day. 30 days until we begin to restore the soul of the nation.  Chip in to power our campaign through this final stretch:  https://t.co/v5RXu2WPlZ
1312831100914405379 2020-10-04 12:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Before we're Democrats or Republicans or independents — we're Americans.  We can't forget that.
1312804676547620864 2020-10-04 10:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There are only 30 days until Election Day — but in many states, you don’t have to wait until November 3rd to make your voice heard. Head to  https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB and make a plan to vote early today.
1312776994799661057 2020-10-04 08:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 30 days.
1312755603215773697 2020-10-04 07:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Receiving the Medal of Freedom from my friend @BarackObama was a great, great honor. I'm proud to have dedicated my life to serving this country — but I'm not done yet.  https://t.co/NKEmYGOl6s
1312546726528638977 2020-10-03 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> At this moment, we’re facing unprecedented crises. But I know the American people have what it takes to overcome them.  There’s not a single thing beyond our capacity.

1312491865095241729 2020-10-03 13:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> One month until we can call @DrBiden our First Lady-Elect.  https://t.co/Yi6wxsonYP
1312471229207543809 2020-10-03 12:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's time we come together.  It's time we see each other as fellow Americans, who don't just live in red states and blue states, but who live in — and love — the United States of America.  That's who we are — and there is nothing we cannot do if we do it together.
1312460408192724992 2020-10-03 11:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> One month until Election Day. Let’s do this, America.
1312388685309108224 2020-10-03 06:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Be a patriot. Do your part.  Wearing a mask will protect you. But it will also protect those around you — your mom, your dad, your son, your daughter, your neighbor, your co-worker.  Don’t just do it for yourself. Do it for the people you love.
1312215292655927296 2020-10-02 19:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to come together.  https://t.co/P8SkE6vkX1
1312206233038974976 2020-10-02 18:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you, Grand Rapids, for a great afternoon. From the virus to the economy, we face immense challenges as a nation. But if we come together and act as one America, we can and will overcome them.  https://t.co/eY5FVKRv3K
1312177040561328129 2020-10-02 16:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m running as a Democrat, but I will be an American president. Whether you voted for me or against me, I will represent you.
1312169490935808000 2020-10-02 16:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can, we will, and we must come together.
1312149358356303873 2020-10-02 14:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This cannot be a partisan moment.  It must be an American moment.  We have to come together as a nation.
1312126818854428673 2020-10-02 13:26:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m delivering remarks from Grand Rapids, Michigan. Tune in.  https://t.co/LhZJjc4wIb
1312107582975209474 2020-10-02 12:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight, @BarackObama, @KamalaHarris, and @MichaelB4Jordan are hosting a grassroots fundraiser to discuss what's at stake this November and the importance of making your voice heard at the ballot box.

1312065485400346625 2020-10-02 09:22:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m happy to report that Jill and I have tested negative for COVID. Thank you to everyone for your messages of concern. I hope this serves as a reminder: wear a mask, keep social distance, and wash your hands.
1312010736604979201 2020-10-02 05:45:10 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family.
1311828242517680135 2020-10-01 17:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump will do everything he can to distract from the fact that because of his failed COVID-19 response:  - Over 200,000 Americans have died - 26 million are on unemployment - 1 in 6 small businesses risk permanent closure  We can’t let him.
1311807606365790210 2020-10-01 16:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When I first ran for Senate, we put up a billboard that said, “Joe Biden: For all our families.”  It’s a motto that has guided me throughout my career.  It doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or Republican—I’ll be a president for all Americans, not just the ones who vote for me.
1311796785153802241 2020-10-01 15:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On Native Women's Equal Pay Day, we recognize the hard truth that Native women earn just $0.57 for every dollar a white man makes. It's unacceptable.  A Biden-Harris Administration will stand with women in Indian Country and pass legislation to close the gender wage gap.  https://t.co/RstWRwFc2J
1311775395679809536 2020-10-01 14:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> During Filipino American History Month, we celebrate the community's immense contributions to our country — from early immigrants to the millions today, many who serve in the military or as frontline workers. As President, I'll work alongside them to protect the American people.
1311762811257851906 2020-10-01 13:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Three years ago today, Las Vegas was struck by tragedy when a gunman opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest Festival. It remains the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.  As we remember those we lost, we must take action to ensure it never happens again.
1311744691776307200 2020-10-01 12:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I wish a happy Mid-Autumn Festival to all those celebrating. We join you in hoping for a future filled with peace and prosperity — and hope your festivities lead to a bountiful harvest in the year ahead.
1311738904068927494 2020-10-01 11:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I want to wish a very happy birthday to President Carter –– a patriot, a humanitarian, and a friend. Thank you for your tireless dedication to our country and to the world.  https://t.co/SrajBmltek
1311722546287566857 2020-10-01 10:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On behalf of Jill and our entire family, I want to wish the Korean-American community a happy Chuseok. May your celebrations be filled with laughter, joy, and plenty of good food. 행복한 한가위 보내세요!
1311706439795175424 2020-10-01 09:36:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I paid my taxes.  These folks paid their taxes.  So why didn’t President Trump pay his?  https://t.co/gcRWGnWF57
1311677247825211393 2020-10-01 07:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You determine the outcome of this election — not Donald Trump.  Vote:  https://t.co/eoxT07uII9
1311485988447936512 2020-09-30 19:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's safe to say I've gotten to know the hardworking men and women of @Amtrak over the years — I'm proud to stand with them as they face furloughs due to funding cuts.  These essential workers have kept us moving during this pandemic –– now it's time we have their backs.
1311481457307574274 2020-09-30 18:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Last night, I went toe-to-toe with Donald Trump and laid out my vision for a stronger, more inclusive America. Check out a few of the top moments from the first debate:  https://t.co/H1WFQIxU6y

1311458807999062016 2020-09-30 17:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Last night reinforced why I got into this race: We are in a battle for the soul of this nation — and it’s a battle we must win.

1311433140078964736 2020-09-30 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> White supremacy has no place in America.  We shouldn’t have to beg the President of the United States to say that.
1311423649891508224 2020-09-30 14:52:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, for stop four of the Build Back Better Express Tour. Tune in now to watch.  https://t.co/1NOIrJrvJd

1311415774687395840 2020-09-30 14:21:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hello, Greensburg!  https://t.co/m7L9zdM8uF
1311395138506240001 2020-09-30 12:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Listening to folks and discussing how we can make their lives better. It’s what our Build Back Better Express Tour is all about — and it’s what I’ll do every day as your president.  https://t.co/y6m8F2UnQy
1311379090608279552 2020-09-30 11:55:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for stop three of the Build Back Better Express Tour. Tune in now to watch.  https://t.co/KoGBkEKUxS
1311374502505279489 2020-09-30 11:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump showed the country last night just how unfit he is to be president. If you weren't able to bear watching it, we condensed it down to one minute for you:  https://t.co/uopjSrldzn
1311365694886481920 2020-09-30 11:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I took the Amtrak from Wilmington to Washington, D.C., every day for 36 years. The journey became routine, but the hardworking men and women I met along the way became dear friends.  https://t.co/kyikjGKFQ9
1311361668111306752 2020-09-30 10:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Enough with the racist dog whistles, Donald. You wouldn’t know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn.

1311268302950260737 2020-09-30 04:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There’s no other way to put it: the President of the United States refused to disavow white supremacists on the debate stage last night.  https://t.co/Q3VZTW1vUV
1311146751869550594 2020-09-29 20:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, we don't have to put up with four more years of that.  https://t.co/aIt2BNuQg3
1311143480379371520 2020-09-29 20:19:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This. This is Donald Trump's America.
1311138195497680898 2020-09-29 19:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> After tonight, the choice in this election has never been clearer — and with 35 days to go, the stakes have never been higher. Tomorrow marks our final end-of-quarter deadline, and we need your help to hit our goal.  Chip in to help beat Donald Trump:  https://t.co/qenDA6FsjW
1311137440334192640 2020-09-29 19:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You heard a lot come out of President Trump’s mouth. Can you name one thing he said to actually make your life better?
1311137188969545731 2020-09-29 19:54:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You have it in your control to determine what this country’s gonna look like the next four years. Is it going to change –– or are you going to get four more years of these lies?  https://t.co/eoxT07uII9
1311136685426577408 2020-09-29 19:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who will bring us together — not tear us further apart.  https://t.co/kGfg63xbYE

1311132658999623685 2020-09-29 19:36:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Under this president, we have become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided, and more violent.   When I was vice president, we inherited a recession, I was asked to fix it, and I did.  We left Donald Trump a booming economy, and he caused a recession.  https://t.co/uEMPaTtZ7F

1311128884121755648 2020-09-29 19:21:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Beau Biden was not a loser.  https://t.co/hwzlZrjh75
1311126367614971906 2020-09-29 19:11:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump isn't a law and order president. He's a president who breaks the law and creates disorder.
1311125864193708032 2020-09-29 19:09:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump talks a lot about the art of the deal. But under his watch, China has perfected the art of the steal.  https://t.co/OSTsHHTtBQ
1311124857921441792 2020-09-29 19:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> More jobs were created in the final three years of the Obama-Biden Administration than in the first three years of Donald Trump’s presidency.   A million and a half more jobs.  https://t.co/3Y75JhJY0n
1311124102820687872 2020-09-29 19:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On average, roughly 750 to 1,000 Americans are dying from COVID every day.  When Donald Trump was presented with that number, he said, “It is what it is.”  It is what it is because Donald Trump is who he is.  https://t.co/OOm2pVRijz
1311121082825560065 2020-09-29 18:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Show us your tax returns, @realDonaldTrump.
1311120831032909825 2020-09-29 18:49:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the worst president we've ever had.
1311117559589220355 2020-09-29 18:36:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When I hear 200,000 deaths, I think of the empty chairs at dining room tables all across the country, which just months ago were filled by loved ones.  It didn’t have to be this bad.
1311116804773863426 2020-09-29 18:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It is what it is because Donald Trump is who he is.
1311115797960339456 2020-09-29 18:29:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The American people deserve to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is.  https://t.co/jnFXiDkt2c
1311114791201595392 2020-09-29 18:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump keeps promising to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, but the truth is he’s in Court trying to rip their protections away.  And now, he’s trying to jam through the confirmation of a Justice who will help him get it done.  We can’t let him win.
1311104724943347713 2020-09-29 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m about to step on stage to debate Donald Trump for the first time. But before I do, can you chip in to show him the power of our grassroots base? Every donation — big or small — goes a long way.  https://t.co/HiNSLIqIPQ
1311095916820967424 2020-09-29 17:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This election is Scranton vs. Park Avenue — and with your help, Scranton will win.  https://t.co/WxHNrVKIdb
1311084592338735104 2020-09-29 16:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s debate night, so I’ve got my earpiece and performance enhancers ready.  https://t.co/EhOiWdjh1b
1311078306926788608 2020-09-29 16:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, the big night is finally here. Tune in at 9 PM ET for the first presidential debate.  https://t.co/SqCWN1eKED
1311064460027666444 2020-09-29 15:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we’re elected, @KamalaHarris and I will wake up every single morning to fight for the middle class. For Main Street. For the folks who keep our country running.  We’re going to make our government work for everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected.
1311044326932148225 2020-09-29 13:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You deserve a president who tells you the truth.  https://t.co/YcIMDYZr66
1311034512298582017 2020-09-29 13:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s grassroots donors like you who power our campaign. And I’m counting on you to help us meet our end-of-quarter fundraising goal.  If you’re able, please chip in before tomorrow night’s big deadline:  https://t.co/JDpr6U0evX
1310998525321383944 2020-09-29 10:43:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The American people deserve transparency from their leaders, it's why as of today, I've released 22 years of my tax returns.
1310962034813485057 2020-09-29 08:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> With casualties rapidly mounting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, the Trump Administration needs to call the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan immediately to de-escalate the situation. It must also demand others — like Turkey — stay out of this conflict.  https://t.co/C41YKEGTyA
1310950458912108546 2020-09-29 07:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The American people understand the urgency of this moment. They're voting in droves because their health care hangs in the balance.  But Donald Trump doesn't care — he sees a chance to eliminate Obamacare and rip away health care protections from millions.  It's unconscionable.
1310749886816583684 2020-09-28 18:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe there's no greater economic engine in the world than the hard work and ingenuity of the American people — and I witnessed it firsthand last week in Manitowoc, Wisconsin.  Together, we're going to make sure the future is made here in America.  https://t.co/tw7tv6sPKT
1310738562468511745 2020-09-28 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, this is a big week for our campaign: Tomorrow, I face Donald Trump on the debate stage for the first time — and Wednesday is our final end-of-quarter fundraising deadline.  We can't afford to fall short here. Chip in today:  https://t.co/PBlWnV8pBr
1310730760656044033 2020-09-28 16:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@TheRock is right: Your vote is your voice — and it’s up to all of us to make our voices heard this November.  Make your plan to vote today:  https://t.co/eoxT07uII9  https://t.co/qxteF3FjdX
1310718429733761024 2020-09-28 16:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm not looking to punish anyone, but it's about time the super-wealthy and corporate America start paying their fair share.
1310695780299096065 2020-09-28 14:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Whether it's $7.50, $75, or $750 — every donation makes a big difference during this final stretch.  Chip in to help us get Donald Trump out of the White House:  https://t.co/ttsZXljWG1
1310670618795347970 2020-09-28 13:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump can claim he wants to protect people with pre-existing conditions all he wants — but the fact is he’s fighting tooth and nail to take their protections away.
1310644190364209155 2020-09-28 11:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> How much more did you pay in taxes than President Trump?  Head to  https://t.co/h9ZZ0iBuiE to find out.  https://t.co/w689uVoHq7
1310627077809344513 2020-09-28 10:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here's the deal: Until we deal with COVID-19, we'll never get our economy fully back on track, get our kids safely back to school, or get our lives back.  It's why as president, I won't waste a day getting this virus under control.  https://t.co/xjxsDmKPe3
1310583793355431937 2020-09-28 07:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There's no mystery when it comes to what's happening with the Supreme Court. President Trump and Republicans have been trying to throw out Obamacare for years — and now they see an opening to get it done.  We can't let them get away with it.
1310354783518314497 2020-09-27 16:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On this Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day, Jill and I are keeping the loved ones of our fallen heroes in our prayers. May we never fail to honor them and carry their spirit with us every day.
1310327101183209473 2020-09-27 14:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill, Kamala, Doug, and our families all extend our warmest wishes to all who observe Yom Kippur. May you have an easy and meaningful fast. And may you be sealed in the Book of Life.  https://t.co/z4EMRDH8Y5
1310313259656867840 2020-09-27 13:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The truth is the economy wasn’t working for folks long before these crises hit. It’s why @KamalaHarris and I won’t just build back to the way things were — we’ll build back better. We won’t be satisfied until the economy starts working for everyone.
1310249323578359808 2020-09-27 09:05:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> The decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court affect our everyday lives — and the American people deserve to have their voices heard when it comes to who serves on the Court. Tune in as I deliver remarks on President Trump’s nomination.  https://t.co/N9HmjDXKMw
1310236503998595073 2020-09-27 08:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> These folks know that we can’t saddle this country with four more years of Donald Trump.
1310198997202632711 2020-09-27 05:45:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you @TheRock for your support at this critical moment for our nation.  You said it best: This election is about earning the respect of the American people. It’s about decency. It’s about electing leaders who tell the truth.  Thanks again, DJ. Next time we’re talking cars.  https://t.co/V5kHR5fQbe
1310003720164384782 2020-09-26 16:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the middle of a pandemic, Donald Trump is trying to force through the confirmation of a Justice who will help him destroy Obamacare.  Health care is at stake. Protections for pre-existing conditions are at stake.  We can't let them win.  https://t.co/zIdPmxzYtQ
1309991139584270336 2020-09-26 16:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Senate shouldn't vote until the American people do.
1309979812610617346 2020-09-26 15:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Supreme Court decisions affect our everyday lives, and the Constitution was designed to give voters a voice on who makes those decisions.  The Senate shouldn't act until after the American people select their next president and the next Congress.  Americans deserve to be heard.
1309966978006753280 2020-09-26 14:24:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, President Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court — a jurist with a written track record of disagreeing with the Court’s decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act.  Vote like your health care is on the ballot — because it is.  https://t.co/TDBQOVLP4K
1309949613533659136 2020-09-26 13:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When Ebola hit, President Obama and I took swift action and successfully contained the virus.  After COVID-19 hit, President Trump lied to the American people and said it would miraculously "disappear."  Now, over 200,000 lives have been cut short.  It's a national tragedy.
1309908091249422336 2020-09-26 10:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> At this moment, we're facing both the worst public health crisis of our lifetime and the existential threat of climate change.  We need a president who believes in science.
1309887202529177601 2020-09-26 09:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today is Public Lands Day and National Hunting and Fishing Day — and what better way to celebrate than the long overdue removal of William Perry Pendley from @blmnational. It's a victory for everyone who values our public lands over those who want to exploit them for profit.
1309869586318110721 2020-09-26 07:57:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If I'm elected, I won't wait to take action on COVID-19.  Minutes after the race is called, I’ll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on.  During my transition, I’ll bring together experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.  We will overcome this, together.
1309647623880466432 2020-09-25 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thanks for a great trip, Minnesota! Don’t forget that early voting is now open across the state. Head to  https://t.co/7PghlU2FSm to make your plan to vote today.  https://t.co/xRLkPOGwcr
1309620696293806080 2020-09-25 15:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, Justice Ginsburg made history one last time — and I was grateful to be there to pay my respects. May her memory be a blessing — and may we continue to be voices for justice in her name.  https://t.co/TMJeYw0d89
1309614908636409856 2020-09-25 15:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The unrelenting impact of climate change affects every single one of us.  It requires action, not denial. It requires leadership, not scapegoating.  It requires a president to meet the threshold duty of the office — to care, for everyone.
1309598556559347713 2020-09-25 14:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in the middle of a climate emergency — and every day that Donald Trump remains in the White House further threatens the future of our planet.  We have to vote him out.  https://t.co/NkSJ7bvBoE
1309579424354926595 2020-09-25 12:44:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Obamacare was—and is—a big deal. As president, I’ll protect and build on it, lower health care costs, and give Americans the opportunity to choose a new public option.  We’re going to make sure everyone has access to the affordable health care they need.  https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C
1309561053487955968 2020-09-25 11:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Health care is a right — not a privilege.
1309540165862535172 2020-09-25 10:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the middle of a global pandemic, President Trump is trying to get the U.S. Supreme Court to eliminate Obamacare and rip health care protections away from 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions.  Don't forget that.
1309513490017800192 2020-09-25 08:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you, @CindyMcCain. Your support and your friendship mean the world to me. John and I didn't always agree on the issues, but we put aside our differences to find common ground and move the country forward — it's what I'll do every day as president.  https://t.co/KheAlsKt73
1309280013733240832 2020-09-24 16:54:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> I've spent my career working to end violence against women and will fight to end the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. I applaud Congress for passing Savanna's Act this week.  Now, the Senate and President Trump need to reauthorize VAWA. It's long overdue.
1309261328222216195 2020-09-24 15:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Once again, we are called to ask ourselves whether justice could be equally applied in America. But what's clear is that today in America, Black women deserve better.
1309254305346727941 2020-09-24 15:12:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Trump Administration says "the entire ACA must fall."  They are arguing to strip millions of Americans of health care in the middle of a pandemic.  We can't let him win.  https://t.co/bcwiGz1HOn
1309235386242215940 2020-09-24 13:56:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> In-person early voting should be easy and convenient for all. The Flint, MI City Clerk's office will be open the last three weekends before Election Day for folks to cast their ballots. It's an example that cities and states across the country should follow.
1309233591654776833 2020-09-24 13:49:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> Michigan — You don’t have to wait until November 3rd to cast your ballot, early voting begins today across the state.  It's easy and it's important: head to  https://t.co/iKOSl3K6fS to make your plan to vote early.
1309229372344283138 2020-09-24 13:33:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> En el Día de la Virgen de las Mercedes, acompaño en solidaridad a todos los defensores de derechos humanos de Cuba, Nicaragua y Venezuela, y rezo por la liberación de todos los presos políticos.
1309229177619578888 2020-09-24 13:32:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> On this Feast Day of Our Lady of Mercy, I stand in solidarity with all defenders of human rights from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela — and pray for the freedom of all political prisoners.
1309222572957949952 2020-09-24 13:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Florida — I'm counting on you to vote and help us win the battle for the soul of this nation. Ballots are being sent out today across the state — head to  https://t.co/uAcduFyKm5 to request yours.
1309163181605113857 2020-09-24 09:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are a more just, more equal nation because of Justice Ginsburg. Now it’s up to all of us to carry on her fight.  https://t.co/kFJygqQN0t
1308965630104616961 2020-09-23 20:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Even amidst the profound grief &amp; anger today's decision generated, violence is never &amp; can never be the answer. Those who engage in it must be held accountable. Jill &amp; I are keeping the officers shot tonight in Louisville in our prayers. We wish them both a swift &amp; full recovery.
1308959338384384002 2020-09-23 19:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The 200,000 people we've lost to COVID-19 weren't nobodies, Mr. President.  They were our parents and grandparents, sons and daughters, friends and co-workers.  They were Americans.  https://t.co/EcdaEiwgUS
1308954305278468096 2020-09-23 19:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As Juan Guaidó speaks about the Venezuelan humanitarian crisis and the crimes against humanity perpetrated by Maduro, I reaffirm my commitment to stand with the Venezuelan people.  A Biden-Harris administration will always champion democracy and human rights around the world.
1308951033826160641 2020-09-23 19:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must continue to speak Breonna Taylor’s name, support her family still in grieving, and never give up on ensuring the full promise of America for every American.  https://t.co/KJU21tQq4B
1308812711652802563 2020-09-23 09:57:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> To build our nation back better than before, we have to advance racial equity across the American economy. I’m in Charlotte, North Carolina, with @CP3 to discuss how we’ll get it done. Tune in.  https://t.co/sSA8GZqX5J
1308803310464376833 2020-09-23 09:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Asking for money isn’t my favorite part of running for president. But we’re coming up on our final end-of-quarter deadline of the campaign and need your help to hit our goal.  If you’re able, please chip in today:  https://t.co/H1rd6fUATL
1308789469131075591 2020-09-23 08:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is our moment to tackle systemic racism head-on and build a nation true to our founding ideals. A nation where all men and women are not only created equal — but treated equally.   Here's how we'll advance racial economic equity:  https://t.co/Tjgyn1gR2V
1308769085170229250 2020-09-23 07:04:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve dealt with guys like Donald Trump my whole life.  Guys who look down on you because they’ve got a lot of money.  Guys who think they’re better than you.  Guys who inherited everything they ever got in life — and then squandered it.  https://t.co/o4q5M6VuJC
1308580592938778624 2020-09-22 18:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t let 2016 repeat itself. There’s simply too much on the line for anyone to sit this election out.  Get registered to vote today:  https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB  #NationalVoterRegistrationDay  https://t.co/teVRgVxeeJ
1308559201958985729 2020-09-22 17:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Cindy — I'm deeply honored to have your support and your friendship. This election is bigger than any one political party. It requires all of us to come together as one America to restore the soul of the nation. Together, we'll get it done.
1308557465764507652 2020-09-22 17:03:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> To celebrate #NationalVoterRegistrationDay, we're hosting a virtual rally with @cristela9, @theebillyporter, @chloexhalle, and more! Tune in now — and make sure to register to vote at  https://t.co/eoxT07uII9.  https://t.co/nUjEE6Gi9L
1308551400473817088 2020-09-22 16:39:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have the power to write the future we want for our country — and it starts at the ballot box.   Register to vote today and let’s change the course of history, together. #NationalVoterRegistrationDay  https://t.co/eoxT07uII9
1308541590382682113 2020-09-22 16:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be very clear, @realDonaldTrump: Not a single one of the 200,000 Americans we've lost to this virus was a "nobody."  https://t.co/0Inut60nCP
1308500313909997568 2020-09-22 13:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The last four years come down to the next 42 days. This is our moment — and if you vote, we’ll win.  Head to  https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB and get registered today. #NationalVoterRegistrationDay  https://t.co/jsFBz2NkXN
1308488739509866496 2020-09-22 12:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump sees the world from Park Avenue.  I see the world from where I grew up: Scranton, Pennsylvania.
1308474645000138758 2020-09-22 11:34:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It didn’t have to be this bad.  https://t.co/R2WqNeauiu
1308451240838344706 2020-09-22 10:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 200,000 Americans have died from this virus.  It’s a staggering number that’s hard to wrap your head around. But behind every COVID-19 death is a family and community that will never again be the same.  There’s a devastating human toll to this pandemic — and we can’t forget that.
1308423054834401281 2020-09-22 08:09:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> While other nations worked around the clock to get this virus under control, our president was too busy tweeting and golfing.  Now, nearly 200,000 Americans have died.  It didn’t have to happen this way.  https://t.co/RqdLtARlRW
1308394869153361926 2020-09-22 06:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, we'll pass another grim milestone in this pandemic: 200,000 American lives lost.  Jill and I are keeping everyone who's hurting in our prayers. No words can numb your pain, but know the nation grieves with you.  Today is dark, but we will overcome this. Keep the faith.
1308205622039437312 2020-09-21 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump ran for office saying he would represent the forgotten men and women of this country — and as soon as he got in office, he forgot about us.
1308195555940749316 2020-09-21 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When the virus came, President Trump wasn’t thinking about you, he was thinking about his own reelection.  It’s how Trump looks at the world: It’s always about him, never about us.  You deserve a president who will put you first.
1308187250883284994 2020-09-21 16:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you for the warm welcome, Manitowoc! With the help of companies like Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry, we're going to revitalize American manufacturing and make sure the future is made here in America.  https://t.co/G2IPTLrhHZ
1308125298836172800 2020-09-21 12:25:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> In this moment, we're facing both a public health crisis and an economic crisis because Donald Trump failed to do his job. I'm in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, to discuss what I'll do to get our nation back on track. Tune in.  https://t.co/kMjzL2GAi7
1308050854352695296 2020-09-21 07:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If this reporting is true, this complaint is deeply concerning and needs to be independently investigated immediately. These women are entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. Practices like this would end in a Biden Administration.  https://t.co/Yrf3qW5f7E
1307831910089990144 2020-09-20 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be clear: LGBTQ+ rights are human rights — and “LGBT-free zones” have no place in the European Union or anywhere in the world.  https://t.co/zc8YvSq6iN
1307825366396891136 2020-09-20 16:34:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was proof that courage, conviction, and moral clarity can change not just the law — but also the world.  https://t.co/G50Y2KBtWL
1307806086662156288 2020-09-20 15:17:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> On the third anniversary of Hurricane Maria, it’s not enough to just remember the devastation wrought by the storm. We must act to ensure nothing like it ever happens again and to ensure Puerto Rico gets the full dignity and respect it deserves.  https://t.co/2zOkcVkYEz
1307806085680594944 2020-09-20 15:17:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> En el tercer aniversario del huracán María, no es suficiente recordar la devastación provocada por la tormenta. Debemos actuar para asegurarnos de que nada como esto vuelva a suceder y asegurar que Puerto Rico reciba la dignidad y el respeto que se merece.  https://t.co/x0Hvmq7Qnz
1307775538237333504 2020-09-20 13:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our frontline workers have sacrificed so much during this pandemic — the least President Trump could do is tell them the truth.  https://t.co/TuLCCfnRHx
1307751763114557440 2020-09-20 11:41:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tune in as I deliver remarks on the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the future of the Supreme Court.  https://t.co/i9CleOZIol

1307726217257259009 2020-09-20 10:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Honor and decency are on the ballot this November.  https://t.co/pWmWySJAs5
1307703815630540802 2020-09-20 08:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It was my honor to preside over Justice Ginsburg’s confirmation hearings, and to support her accession to the Supreme Court. Her opinions, and her dissents, will shape the basis of our law for generations to come — and we’ll be a more just and equal nation because of it.  https://t.co/SmZD2KyyyG
1307491919384260609 2020-09-19 18:29:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m Joe Biden and I approve this message.  https://t.co/TuRZXPE5xK
1307456938716749825 2020-09-19 16:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must win.
1307445614184198151 2020-09-19 15:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Supreme Court is on the ballot. And the outcome will impact everything from health care to civil rights — affecting generations to come.   Vote. Our future depends on it.  https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M
1307424474938122245 2020-09-19 14:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought for all of us. She was a giant of the Court and unflinching in her pursuit of equal justice under the law. Because of her life’s work, we are closer to that more perfect union we’ve always strived to be.  https://t.co/o30ZCuj10G
1307396540932280320 2020-09-19 12:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg inspired us all.  https://t.co/vQQiB1oQ2J
1307146895802785792 2020-09-18 19:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be clear: The voters should pick a President, and that President should select a successor to Justice Ginsburg.
1307145637595459587 2020-09-18 19:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ruth Bader Ginsburg stood for all of us. She was an American hero, a giant of legal doctrine, and a relentless voice in the pursuit of that highest American ideal: Equal Justice Under Law. May her memory be a blessing to all people who cherish our Constitution and its promise.
1307095809226235904 2020-09-18 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I wish our friends in the Jewish community a very healthy and happy New Year. As we mark this new beginning, let us commit to pursuing peace and justice in the year ahead. #RoshHashanah
1307093292937428992 2020-09-18 16:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Amy is right: our democracy depends on your vote. And you don't have to wait until November to cast your ballot.  If you're in Minnesota, head to  https://t.co/NGRGPSBJok and make your plan to vote today.
1307076903296274432 2020-09-18 14:59:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> Now, it's time to vote. Make your plan today. #NationalBlackVoterDay  https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M
1307076683044806657 2020-09-18 14:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let's be honest: my campaign wouldn't be here if it weren't for the support of Black Americans. And I know we don't have a chance to win without your support.  I'll do everything I can to earn your vote—and together, we'll build a nation that works for all. #NationalBlackVoterDay
1307067371903954946 2020-09-18 14:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Virginia — early voting is now open!

1307062087126982656 2020-09-18 14:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Frankie — I'm honored to have your support and couldn't agree more: We are at our best when we act as one America. Together, we're going to unite the country and restore the soul of the nation.  https://t.co/0VFApM5Oee
1307047965945524224 2020-09-18 13:04:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> A Biden-Harris administration will create millions of good-paying, union jobs and ensure the future is made in America — by all of America. I’m speaking live from Hermantown, MN on how we’ll get it done. Tune in.  https://t.co/ZFxVgWUt7n
1307025345082724352 2020-09-18 11:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I can't believe I have to say this, but if I'm elected president, I won't put a climate change denier — one who called the scientific community "a bunch of thugs" — in charge of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  https://t.co/FcRtv8ZcYS
1307002947285315586 2020-09-18 10:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When we needed Donald Trump to tell the truth about COVID-19, he lied to us.  When we needed him to take action to contain its spread, he spent his days golfing.  When we needed a president the most, he was nowhere to be found.  It's unforgivable.
1306975013355089922 2020-09-18 08:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump claimed he would be "the greatest jobs president God ever created."  But the fact is he's the worst jobs president in recorded history.  We can't afford another four years of his failed leadership.  https://t.co/uW10KJhMsV
1306778468034650112 2020-09-17 19:14:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, I just wrapped up my first CNN Town Hall of the general election. We’re in the home stretch of this campaign and your support matters more than ever.  Chip in to help us keep tonight’s momentum going:  https://t.co/J2E4dtxGEK
1306777461557022730 2020-09-17 19:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> What the hell makes you think I need an Ivy League degree to be president? #BidenTownHall  https://t.co/fzoMjYTlZ4
1306772679802920960 2020-09-17 18:51:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Unlike President Trump, I’ll be a president for all Americans — not just the ones who vote for me. #BidenTownHall  https://t.co/2lttWNRl5n
1306766136747470848 2020-09-17 18:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here's the deal: I've condemned every form of violence, no matter what the source is. President Trump has not. #BidenTownHall  https://t.co/kqoaJRLYMn
1306765130210795520 2020-09-17 18:21:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I will bring Americans together and finally deliver much needed policing reform. #BidenTownHall  https://t.co/7iwYuXOS2p
1306763872020422656 2020-09-17 18:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You lost your freedom because President Trump didn't act. #BidenTownHall  https://t.co/wOOeSSNmH6
1306759593607852032 2020-09-17 17:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m in this race to fight for the hardworking Americans who wake up every single day and make our country run. #BidenTownHall  https://t.co/vOiOl9UK5f
1306756070585573378 2020-09-17 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'll tell you what takes away your freedom: not being able to see your kid, go to the football game, or see your mom or dad in the hospital. That's what is costing us our freedom. #BidenTownHall  https://t.co/YM57H8lv2K
1306753050623836161 2020-09-17 17:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The choice in this election couldn’t be more clear.  We can choose four more years of Donald Trump’s dark and divisive politics.  Or we can choose a path of hope and light—and build a better future for all.  Chip in to help us win. #BidenTownHall  https://t.co/a1aSMb7x1G
1306750785879973888 2020-09-17 17:24:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This election is Scranton vs. Park Avenue.
1306749527366410240 2020-09-17 17:19:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump knew how deadly COVID-19 was and did nothing. It’s close to criminal. #BidenTownHall  https://t.co/OL3uIA1QSZ
1306742229352902656 2020-09-17 16:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m about to take the stage for tonight’s Town Hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Tune in to @CNN now to watch live.  https://t.co/zi0P1gcAiU
1306734679601668098 2020-09-17 16:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump wants to give his rich friends another tax cut, so they pay a lower tax rate than tens of millions of essential workers and middle class Americans.  We need a president who cares about more than the wealthy and well-connected.
1306721341832216576 2020-09-17 15:27:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m looking forward to being back in my home town of Scranton, Pennsylvania, for tonight’s CNN Town Hall. Tune in at 8 PM ET to watch.  https://t.co/yHez7c4gaq
1306695924308013056 2020-09-17 13:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No surprise, Donald Trump is lying about my tax plan. Here’s the truth about how I’ll make corporations pay their fair share while ensuring Americans making under $400,000 don’t pay a penny more.  https://t.co/0cpJjpCS33
1306669797623517184 2020-09-17 12:02:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ahead of #RoshHashanah, Jill and I want to wish everyone in the Jewish community a very happy, healthy, and sweet New Year. Tune in to our virtual event:  https://t.co/ECEfGRqX5n
1306661700054196227 2020-09-17 11:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The 100 richest Americans have made more than $300 billion during the COVID-19 crisis.   Now, in the middle of a pandemic and economic crisis, Donald Trump wants to give them a $29 billion tax break.   Let that sink in.
1306644082597531654 2020-09-17 10:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If you make under $400,000, you will not pay a penny more in taxes when I'm president.  The super-wealthy and big corporations will finally pay their fair share — and we'll invest that money in working families.  We're going to reward work — not wealth.
1306620175106465796 2020-09-17 08:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@realDonaldTrump, the job is to be president of all Americans. For the love of God start acting like it.
1306612373722030081 2020-09-17 08:14:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We've had to endure President Trump's incompetence and dishonesty when it comes to testing, wearing masks, and socially distancing.    We can't afford a repeat of those fiascos with a COVID-19 vaccine.  The stakes are too high.
1306594254765068288 2020-09-17 07:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Yesterday, I met with some of our nation's top experts to discuss how we distribute a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. If I win this election, I know that there won't be a minute to waste. I'll get to work on day one implementing an effective distribution plan.  https://t.co/GfgSnBwjTQ
1306403748898656257 2020-09-16 18:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump promised the opioid crisis would end "quickly" if he won, but the fact is drug overdose deaths are up nearly 10% across the country. It's heartbreaking.  As president, I promise I'll take action to end this epidemic.  https://t.co/tnVAqXbXpm
1306399974276526081 2020-09-16 18:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if more of America is ablaze?  https://t.co/DwCIoNkwk1
1306384874643894272 2020-09-16 17:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re going to get this virus under control and get your life back on track.
1306373549939195905 2020-09-16 16:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is Donald Trump’s America after one term. Why would we give him a second?  https://t.co/E2dwc6R30h
1306357192262590467 2020-09-16 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When I said I trust vaccines, and I trust the scientists, but I don't trust Donald Trump — this is what I meant:
1306334039557586944 2020-09-16 13:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t allow the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit.  Any trade deal between the U.S. and U.K. must be contingent upon respect for the Agreement and preventing the return of a hard border. Period.
1306319984721682432 2020-09-16 12:52:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> We all want a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible, but it needs to be based on science — not politics. Tune in as I discuss how we can develop and equitably distribute a safe and effective vaccine:  https://t.co/KPxTaqAiVd
1306279178304536576 2020-09-16 10:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’ve lost nearly 200,000 Americans to COVID-19.   It didn’t have to be this bad — but Donald Trump failed to do his job.
1306254264298213378 2020-09-16 08:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The fact of the matter is Donald Trump doesn't have a health care plan.  I do — and you can read it here:  https://t.co/gm6jgUrcaT  https://t.co/LbvDvFj4m8
1306245959421177856 2020-09-16 07:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Science will win.
1306236396378546179 2020-09-16 07:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump’s climate denial may not have directly caused the record fires we’re seeing on the West Coast. But if he gets four more years in the White House, they’ll only become more common, devastating, and deadly.  https://t.co/7rsG9VDZ4w
1306055202290544640 2020-09-15 19:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To be clear: I am not currently president. But if you chip in now, we can change that in November:  https://t.co/eFS4tDfHEx
1306053944066494465 2020-09-15 19:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hispanic Heritage Month is a reminder of the strength we draw as a nation from our immigrant roots. No matter where your family came from, we're here because we all share the same ideals. That's the story of America — and it is well worth celebrating.  https://t.co/rign44stJc
1306030539783110657 2020-09-15 17:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump not only suggested we sell or trade Puerto Rico — but he also left our fellow Americans without the resources they desperately needed after Hurricane Maria. It's unacceptable.  As president, I'll support the island's full recovery and invest in its people and future.
1306013661173932033 2020-09-15 16:34:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today marks the official start of Hispanic Heritage Month. Tune in as we kick off our celebration from Florida:  https://t.co/GMSo25KzM6
1305996062591574017 2020-09-15 15:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As we celebrate the Independence Day of Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, we must affirm the democratic aspirations and human rights of people across Latin America.  I'll always fight for democracy and for those who come to America seeking a better life.
1305983479830593536 2020-09-15 14:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing is a powerful reminder of our past and what remains at stake in this election. As we honor the memory of those four little girls, we must commit to defeating the poisonous ideology of white supremacy that lit the fuse 57 years ago.
1305974675370106881 2020-09-15 14:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe that every American deserves a fair shot to get ahead and a government that treats them equally. But that hasn't been the case for the people of Puerto Rico. Today, I'm releasing my new plan to change that:  https://t.co/qX7sQPPfmX
1305954790711734272 2020-09-15 12:41:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> For months, President Trump has failed to provide desperately needed fiscal relief to our state and local governments — and we’re seeing the consequences every day.  Our students and educators deserve better.  As president, I’ll make sure they always have the resources they need.
1305929147441532930 2020-09-15 10:59:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> The most sacred obligation of our government is to do right by those who defend our nation at war. I’m in Tampa, Florida, to hear from veterans and to discuss how I’ll honor that promise as president. Tune in:  https://t.co/SkJOytj8gm
1305912512265641984 2020-09-15 09:53:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Wheels up, folks.  https://t.co/zQDCWhpm1v
1305884830370988035 2020-09-15 08:03:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19, but he is responsible for his failed response and for lying to the American people.  https://t.co/cWuEoHiUxj
1305881558235189249 2020-09-15 07:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This morning, parents all across the West — already worried about their kids being indoors because of COVID-19 — are now also waking up worried about their kids being outside.  We need a president who takes climate change seriously.
1305680232469467137 2020-09-14 18:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The fact is, Iran is closer to a nuclear bomb today than it was when Donald Trump took office.  Every day he’s in charge of our national security is another day our enemies are emboldened and the American people are at risk.  https://t.co/hEMkpGARuo
1305666390670675969 2020-09-14 17:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, he thinks “hoax.”   I think “jobs.”  Good paying, union jobs that put Americans to work building a stronger, more climate-resilient nation.  https://t.co/AKl9jZKB0s
1305648774157565952 2020-09-14 16:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@realDonaldTrump, you know what’s actually threatening our suburbs?  Wildfires. Floods. Hurricanes.  We need to act on climate. Now.
1305608509229207552 2020-09-14 13:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Science knows.  https://t.co/Pwx8meY4zw
1305605992483258371 2020-09-14 13:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, it all comes down to this. We have just 50 days until the most important election of our lifetimes.  Make a plan to have your voice heard this November.  https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M
1305578058326343683 2020-09-14 11:44:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Amy Poehler and @MayaRudolph know a thing or two about @HillaryClinton and @KamalaHarris — and I can't wait to see what they have in store for tonight's grassroots fundraiser.

1305559162080747525 2020-09-14 10:28:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> Climate change is the existential challenge that will define our future as a country.

1305537793414889472 2020-09-14 09:04:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 50 days until Election Day. 50 days to do everything we can to make Donald Trump a one-term president.  Chip in to power our campaign through this final stretch:  https://t.co/6WkyWFXVpc
1305510362255564801 2020-09-14 07:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 50 days.
1305300227721703424 2020-09-13 17:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Weapons of war have no place in our communities.  We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
1305287645635829761 2020-09-13 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When President Trump talks about America leading the world, this is what he means.  https://t.co/z2KpYhojtB
1305275061671206914 2020-09-13 15:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know we can beat Donald Trump and build this nation back better — but we need your help to do it. That's why we're launching our new Grassroots Fundraising Team.  Sign up and help us win this November.  https://t.co/T5CN04xsXo
1305260921367990277 2020-09-13 14:43:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> I promise that as president, I’ll make reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act a top priority and continue working to end gender-based violence.  https://t.co/wmN7bSAUVg
1305260678991810562 2020-09-13 14:42:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> With each reauthorization, VAWA has become stronger.  The latest bill—passed by the House last year—would close loopholes allowing abusers to obtain guns and extend protections for Native women.  But Mitch McConnell refuses to bring it to the floor for a vote. It’s despicable.
1305260465585451008 2020-09-13 14:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 26 years ago today, the Violence Against Women Act became law. In the years since, it has saved countless lives and helped change the culture around sexual assault and domestic violence.  Writing and championing the law remains one of my proudest accomplishments.  https://t.co/9pV7X9fgKq
1305250902861918208 2020-09-13 14:04:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's hard to believe, but Monday marks 50 days until Election Day. To kick off the final stretch, @HillaryClinton and @KamalaHarris are hosting a grassroots fundraiser.  You won't want to miss this, folks. Chip in to reserve your spot:  https://t.co/WI4clZqxEA
1305229763464900608 2020-09-13 12:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 26 years ago today, the Senate passed 10-year bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines—it was an effort I was proud to champion.  These bans saved lives, and Congress should have never let them expire.  As president, I’ll take on the @NRA and we’ll ban them once again.
1305160054346141703 2020-09-13 08:03:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This cold-blooded shooting is unconscionable and the perpetrator must be brought to justice.  Violence of any kind is wrong; those who commit it should be caught and punished.  Jill and I are keeping the deputies and their loved ones in our hearts and praying for a full recovery.
1304935826682458112 2020-09-12 17:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In a Biden-Harris administration, “Buy American” will be more than a slogan.   We’re going to invest an additional $400 billion in purchasing American-made products and keep good-paying jobs here at home.  https://t.co/HrOOkXerMP
1304920726932041729 2020-09-12 16:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump and I have pretty different philosophies when it comes to giving our word.   Mine means something.   When I tell the American people I’m going to do something — I follow through.  https://t.co/FCHpIGHtf2
1304879958808985602 2020-09-12 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I promise you that if I’m elected president, I’ll never forget what the job is about. It’s about you — the American people.  https://t.co/ACGjYymWSg
1304866117354020864 2020-09-12 12:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Iran’s cruel execution of Navid Afkari is a travesty. No country should arrest, torture, or execute peaceful protestors or activists.   Iran must free its other political prisoners, including Nasrin Sotoudeh, and release unjustly detained Americans.
1304860328920981504 2020-09-12 12:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I’ll impose a tax penalty on companies that ship jobs overseas and sell products back to the U.S. — and I’ll create millions of good-paying jobs here at home.  We’re going to make sure the future is made in America — by all of America's workers.  https://t.co/8smOm5MGx1
1304847494518575108 2020-09-12 11:21:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The science is clear, and deadly signs like the fires out West are unmistakable — climate change poses an existential threat to our way of life.  We must act now to avoid a future defined by tragedies like the one American families are enduring today.  https://t.co/iGNTQVOy3t
1304796917763768320 2020-09-12 08:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> You deserve a President and Vice President who will spend every minute of every day working to make your life better.  I promise that’s exactly what @KamalaHarris and I will do.
1304563623998570496 2020-09-11 16:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Always remember.  https://t.co/BwaBSo8LFq
1304473050075860997 2020-09-11 10:33:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> And now, as then, we owe it to them to come together as a nation — so that Americans can once again do what we did so bravely nineteen years ago: turn from tragedy to purpose, rebuild our lives, and begin, in time, to heal.
1304473048771420165 2020-09-11 10:33:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> Now, as then, our heroes are ordinary people doing extraordinary things: nurses and doctors; delivery drivers and grocery clerks; public transit workers and educators; regular Americans thrust into courageous acts of sacrifice and service.
1304473047110475776 2020-09-11 10:33:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> This year, we mark the anniversary of 9/11 in the midst of another crisis that compels us to summon the best of the American people in the face of unconscionable, inconceivable loss — a crisis that has already taken nearly 200,000 Americans.
1304473044916875264 2020-09-11 10:33:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> Nineteen years ago, our nation was tested by an unspeakable act of cowardice and hate. Nearly 3,000 lives were cut short: a once-unthinkable toll which tore open the hearts of Americans in every corner of the country.  https://t.co/6rAF0dAd1Y
1304450463920779264 2020-09-11 09:03:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> As a nation, we must never forget those we lost on 9/11 and the incredible bravery of our first responders. Though the wounds of that day will never fully heal, the spirit of Americans recovered as it always does — unbowed by the efforts of those who strike against it.  https://t.co/Ogn7Sbvq1Q
1304219355404791808 2020-09-10 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump said he wanted to be a cheerleader for the country. We didn't need a cheerleader. We needed a president.
1304209289456672768 2020-09-10 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> More than 1,000 people died from COVID yesterday.  @realDonaldTrump watched eight hours of TV.  If I’m president, you might not always agree with me. But I promise you I will always show up and fight for you.  https://t.co/HvVJLS83TZ
1304171037240619008 2020-09-10 14:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is holding a rally in Michigan today—while also refusing to fully fund their National Guard.  These are frontline workers against COVID-19, responsible for testing and distributing food and medical supplies.  Michiganders need a pandemic response—not a pep rally.
1304158957687263235 2020-09-10 13:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Do your part. Wear a mask.  https://t.co/pdnEecS49Q
1304147637201854464 2020-09-10 13:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Make no mistake: Climate change is already here — and we’re witnessing its devastating effects every single day.   We have to get President Trump out of the White House and treat this crisis like the existential threat that it is.  https://t.co/NXzkpaRVsY
1304130016955990017 2020-09-10 11:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To everyone struggling right now, I want you to know that you are not alone. You’re seen, you’re heard, and you’re loved.   If you need help, please don’t hesitate to visit  https://t.co/tPKtlFFCIY.   Better days lie ahead, I promise. #WorldSuicidePreventionDay
1304114917352456192 2020-09-10 10:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The images coming out of California, Oregon, Washington, and other Western states are truly horrifying. If you’re in an impacted area, please heed the warnings from your local authorities and stay safe. Jill and I are keeping you all in our prayers.
1304096798060019713 2020-09-10 09:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> How many more people have to suffer because of President Trump's lies?  https://t.co/m2spzGCKgd
1304085725009248256 2020-09-10 08:54:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump said he didn't want to tell the truth and create a panic. So he did nothing and created a disaster.
1304051499358662656 2020-09-10 06:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I got to meet Lou Brock back in March. I joked that I had really just come to St. Louis to see him—and let me tell you, our meeting was a real highlight. Lou was a true legend and a man of integrity. Jill and I are keeping his loved ones in our prayers during this difficult time.  https://t.co/ZStoBAnk7V
1303867788759568384 2020-09-09 18:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump knew that COVID-19 was dangerous. He knew it was deadly. And he purposely downplayed it.  Now, nearly 200,000 Americans are dead.  It’s unconscionable.  https://t.co/SLqqhmWy8E
1303839351671980032 2020-09-09 16:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You deserve a president who tells you the truth.
1303826768525131776 2020-09-09 15:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If Donald Trump had acted just two weeks earlier, 54,000 lives could have been spared in March and April alone.   Instead, he downplayed the threat and refused to take action — costing lives and sending our economy into a tailspin.  It’s an unjustifiable dereliction of duty.
1303807139203493888 2020-09-09 14:27:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Roberto Clemente was an incredible baseball player. He was a barrier breaker and a humanitarian. As he rose to fame, he lifted the Black and Latino communities with him.  I may be a Phillies fan, but I’m always proud to honor the legacy of #21.  https://t.co/ZWSfIBUD0p
1303789774851907584 2020-09-09 13:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I promise you that if I’m elected, I’ll always tell you the truth.  I’ll listen to the experts and do everything I can to contain this virus.  And I’ll always put your health and safety first — no matter the political cost.
1303756807895220226 2020-09-09 11:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump knew.  He lied to us for months.  And while a deadly disease ripped through our nation, he failed to do his job — on purpose.  It was a life or death betrayal of the American people.
1303750335345733632 2020-09-09 10:41:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m in Warren, Michigan, to discuss how a Biden-Harris administration will ensure the future is made in America — by America’s workers. Tune in now:  https://t.co/OzJ3Vnc8kd
1303729880211759104 2020-09-09 09:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The right to vote is the most sacred American right there is — exercise it.   Make your voice heard this November.  https://t.co/Hy8C4n0lUk
1303699681420087296 2020-09-09 07:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Obama and I rescued the auto industry and helped Michigan's economy come roaring back.  Donald Trump squandered it — and hardworking Michiganders are paying the price every day.  https://t.co/kXjyPbsj8s
1303495445717512192 2020-09-08 17:48:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> Given his track record, no one can take Trump’s word alone on a COVID-19 vaccine. But with satisfactory answers to these questions, every American can have confidence in a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine.  https://t.co/074K1HD9wf
1303495444018929665 2020-09-08 17:48:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> 3: What is the plan to allocate and distribute vaccines to Americans cost-free, safely, equitably, and without politics?   President Trump should release a detailed distribution plan to ensure every American — not just the wealthy and well-connected — receives the vaccine.
1303495442924212224 2020-09-08 17:48:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> 2: Who will validate that the Administration’s decision to greenlight a COVID-19 vaccine is driven by science and not political motivation?   We must hear uncensored statements on efficacy and safety from @FDACBER, the @US_FDA vaccine advisory committee, and Dr. Fauci.
1303495441875640321 2020-09-08 17:48:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> 1: What criteria will be used to ensure a vaccine meets the scientific standard of safety and efficacy?  The FDA must clarify what criteria it will use, and President Trump must commit to respecting the independent judgment of the non-political professional staff at the FDA.
1303495440701313025 2020-09-08 17:48:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine could save countless lives. We need one as soon as possible.  But while I see a vaccine as a product of science, President Trump sees it as a political tool.  Politics should play no role in this. The Administration must answer the following:
1303487030052007936 2020-09-08 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is incapable of providing the leadership this moment requires.
1303460102649843717 2020-09-08 15:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every single American worker deserves the chance to join a union. As president, I’ll strengthen our labor unions and ensure workers can bargain for the pay, benefits, and workplace protections they deserve.  https://t.co/Yqd8D5SzbQ
1303435439978803202 2020-09-08 13:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I can tell you few people know me as well as @BarackObama and @KamalaHarris do.
1303423093176774657 2020-09-08 13:00:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> Just months ago, Donald Trump was planning to allow oil and gas drilling off the coast of Florida.   Now, with 56 days until the election, he conveniently says that he changed his mind. Unbelievable.   You don't have to guess where I stand: I oppose new offshore drilling.
1303413042470776832 2020-09-08 12:21:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On this feast day of Cuba’s patron saint la Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre, Jill and I pray that the love and compassion “Cachita” inspires will fill the hearts of Cubans and believers around the world.  https://t.co/Vn1FoFV4Uo
1303392660699451392 2020-09-08 11:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Unlike Donald Trump, I'll listen to the experts and heed their advice — especially when it comes to matters of health and safety.  You should expect nothing less from your president.  https://t.co/RwF1BQtJAh
1303370008832155648 2020-09-08 09:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This economy may be working great for Donald Trump and his wealthy friends — but it's not working for the rest of America.  It's time we change that.
1303334776959651840 2020-09-08 07:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> At our best, America has always been generous, kind, and optimistic. We treat each other with dignity, give hate no safe harbor, and leave no one behind.  I believe we can be that nation once again.
1303123383840890880 2020-09-07 17:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mr. President — If you’re so good at making deals, then why does your trade deal cost American workers so much pain while letting China off the hook for its biggest trade abuses?  https://t.co/mL8a67CTAw
1303098219337981954 2020-09-07 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I’ll make record investments in American industry and create millions of good-paying, union jobs.  We’re going to make sure the future is made in America — and built by union workers.  https://t.co/rt5RD9Fdi0
1303079343766331393 2020-09-07 14:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Wall Street didn't build this country — the middle class did. And unions built the middle class.  Donald Trump doesn't understand that. We need a president who does.
1303056694360944640 2020-09-07 12:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's not enough to just thank our essential workers — we need to pay them. As president, I’ll:  - Raise the minimum wage to $15 - End the tipped minimum wage - End the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities - Ensure everyone has strong benefits
1303036310177951747 2020-09-07 11:24:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> For years, President Trump and Republicans have waged a war on America's labor unions.   It will end on my watch.  I'll sign the PRO Act — making it easier for workers to organize and collectively bargain — and be the strongest labor president workers have ever had.
1303011396041486340 2020-09-07 09:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Together, we can build a future that reflects working people’s courage and ambition. One that not only offers good jobs — but the dignity, equity, shared prosperity, and common purpose due to every American.  https://t.co/FDLGMKCgWD
1303001581437165570 2020-09-07 09:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The 40-hour workweek Minimum wage Overtime pay Health care  Workplace safety protections  They’re all because of unions — and it’s time we recognize that.
1302969877154668544 2020-09-07 07:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, we honor the generations of union workers who fought for the rights, power, wages, and benefits that built and sustained the great American middle class. #LaborDay  https://t.co/gTqE9tYUKd
1302769803925487616 2020-09-06 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need to restore honor and decency to the White House.
1302763609194467328 2020-09-06 17:20:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> Time and again, the president has refused to provide Puerto Rico with much-needed resources. He’s repeatedly insulted Puerto Ricans and this latest action is another example of his disrespect for the island.   This ends when I’m elected president.
1302732055214653441 2020-09-06 15:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump promised to be "the greatest jobs president God ever created."  But in reality, he's on track to become the first president in modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when he entered.  American workers can't take four more years of his failed leadership.
1302705631938347009 2020-09-06 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We all want our schools to reopen — but we need to do it in a way that puts the health and safety of our students and educators first.  Here's how @KamalaHarris and I will reopen our schools safely and effectively:  https://t.co/yJswM3PliF
1302675432144351234 2020-09-06 11:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We know what President Trump thinks of our nation's veterans. Here is what they think of him.  https://t.co/QX910VyP0u
1302649007991214081 2020-09-06 09:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s time we reward work — not just wealth.
1302615789313417217 2020-09-06 07:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Be a patriot. Wear a mask.  https://t.co/LrXyfxphuD
1302396094886813698 2020-09-05 17:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> The economy wasn’t working for folks long before this virus hit. That’s why @KamalaHarris and I won’t just build back to the way things were — we’re going to build back better.  We’re going to make sure everyone has a fair shot to get ahead.  https://t.co/rt5RD9Fdi0
1302371428994412544 2020-09-05 15:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I will:  - Call for nationwide mask mandates - Implement widespread testing - Accelerate the development of treatments and vaccines  I’m ready to work on day one to contain the spread of this virus and get our country back on track.
1302343746756005891 2020-09-05 13:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Nicaraguan asylum seekers fleeing oppression deserve to have their cases heard. Instead, they’re being deported back into the tyrannical grip of Daniel Ortega without a chance to pursue their claims.  President Trump’s cruelty truly knows no bounds.
1302325123802824704 2020-09-05 12:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mr. President, enough with the weekend golf trips and erratic tweets. It's time for you to get to work and control the spread of this virus.
1302302977953271808 2020-09-05 10:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our nation’s veterans speak for themselves.  https://t.co/ai5Y1MzCaQ
1302033703539937285 2020-09-04 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day Donald Trump proves how morally unfit he is to lead our nation.  In 60 days, we have to vote him out.  https://t.co/EteeruIOm6
1301990711013838849 2020-09-04 14:09:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> Now is not the time for a victory lap, Mr. President. Just because your wealthy friends and donors are doing well doesn't mean everyone else is.  Get off the golf course. Call the leaders of Congress to the White House. And make a deal that delivers for working people.
1301990709910794243 2020-09-04 14:09:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> The fact is we're more than six months into this pandemic, and:  - 11.5 million Americans don't have their jobs back - Almost 30 million are on unemployment - We're down 720,000 manufacturing jobs - Nearly 1 in 6 small businesses have closed their doors
1301990708920844291 2020-09-04 14:09:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm grateful for everyone who found work in August and found that glimmer of hope — but there is real cause for concern in this morning's jobs report.  The pace of job gains in August was slower than in July. And significantly slower than May or June.
1301926526925983744 2020-09-04 09:54:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tune in as I discuss how our economic crisis has been worsened by President Trump's failure to get COVID-19 under control:  https://t.co/YeDBBOntHe
1301913914922299393 2020-09-04 09:04:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mr. President, if you don’t respect our troops, you can’t lead them.  https://t.co/hcX9hGgdm5
1301697991481458688 2020-09-03 18:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here’s my promise to you: If I have the honor of serving as the next commander in chief, I will ensure that our American heroes know that I will have their back and honor their sacrifice. Always.
1301686419421888512 2020-09-03 18:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> In 2016, President Trump promised to reduce the trade deficit and said: "You will see a drop like you've never seen before."  The reality? It's the highest it's been in 12 years.  American workers can't afford another four years of his failed leadership.
1301677355526770689 2020-09-03 17:24:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The President has a duty to set an example.  https://t.co/OwiCo345Ph
1301666282589347841 2020-09-03 16:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, today marks two months until Election Day. That means we have just two months to do everything we can to beat Donald Trump and restore the soul of this nation.  Chip in to help us win in November:  https://t.co/UjC7yoIpU4
1301657977821241344 2020-09-03 16:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is our moment to root out systemic racism and ensure justice finally rings out for all in America.  https://t.co/mXzAZ9VZfR
1301638096992206850 2020-09-03 14:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who will work to lower the temperature — not raise it. A president who will bring people together and find solutions to the challenges we face.  That's what I went to Kenosha to do today, and it's what I'll do every day in the White House.  https://t.co/dNenwVZjUg
1301594146390466562 2020-09-03 11:53:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s time we come together as a nation to heal and address the challenges we face. Tune in to our community conversation in Kenosha, Wisconsin:  https://t.co/5Vda70tPCu
1301560082933530625 2020-09-03 09:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Right now, classrooms should be humming with excitement for a new year and students’ hopes for their futures.  Instead, many are silent and empty because President Trump didn’t do his job.  America’s families are paying the price for his failures.
1301535924111761408 2020-09-03 08:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I've always believed we're at our best when we act as one America. It's time for us to come together, propel our nation across this turbulent threshold, and build a better future for all.
1301322769045557250 2020-09-02 17:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Time and time again, President Trump has refused to stand up to Putin. His silence on the poisoning of Mr. Navalny is just the latest example.  As president, I'll do what Trump won't: hold the Putin regime accountable for its crimes.  https://t.co/z11YyV6lq0
1301316478889680897 2020-09-02 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve released 21 years of my tax returns.   What are you hiding, @realDonaldTrump?
1301302636881342466 2020-09-02 16:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> They're rooting for chaos and violence because they think it helps them win a second term.  Now ask yourself, is that really who you think should be running the country?  https://t.co/rXf0O5u0WC
1301285020448034817 2020-09-02 15:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we give Donald Trump another four years in the White House, our planet may never recover.
1301267404253786114 2020-09-02 14:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re just over two months from Election Day. But in many states, you don’t have to wait until November to make your voice heard.  Head to  https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M and make a plan to vote early today.
1301237205617135617 2020-09-02 12:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos are the worst possible people to lead our nation’s schools through this pandemic.
1301219337865433097 2020-09-02 11:04:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We all want students back in the classroom, but President Trump hasn't done the work to make sure schools can reopen safely and effectively.  @KamalaHarris and I will be ready on day 1 with a roadmap for reopening.  https://t.co/yJswM3PliF
1301208423036407808 2020-09-02 10:20:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump has failed to address COVID-19 — and now our students and educators are paying the price. Tune in as I discuss my plan to safely and effectively reopen schools:  https://t.co/ntofl4zV7v
1301189337850277892 2020-09-02 09:04:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> This campaign is powered by grassroots supporters like you — and every dollar counts to close the fundraising gap with the Trump campaign. $5, $10, $15, whatever you can, chip in today:  https://t.co/pHQWesk2AR
1301186118621290498 2020-09-02 08:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Last month we raised $364.5 million — 95% of the donations from grassroots supporters like you and the majority online.  Working people are powering our campaign — and I’m grateful.  We’ve got a long way to go to close the fundraising gap and win — but we can do it. Together.
1301162966255980545 2020-09-02 07:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is determined to instill fear and divide us, but what he doesn't understand is that fear never builds the future — hope does.  https://t.co/3DFE6R6CWQ
1300939997059493888 2020-09-01 16:34:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> For far too long, discriminatory policies like redlining have kept Black Americans from having the same opportunities as white Americans.  That’s got to change:  https://t.co/ycM5gKCGyV  https://t.co/mmb0u5kqZq
1300919864295436288 2020-09-01 15:14:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If I’m elected president, I promise you that America will be better prepared to deal with any threats that come our way.  That starts with restoring the PREDICT program that President Trump ended.
1300891426876612608 2020-09-01 13:21:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Together, we’re going to build back better than before and set our nation on a new path.  https://t.co/OQHsy12ODf
1300868022740156417 2020-09-01 11:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@DrBiden and I send our best wishes to members of the Jain faith concluding the holy observance of Paryushan and Das Lakshan. May we all find peace and reconciliation in our lives. Michhami Dukkaddam and Kshamavani!
1300842856974819328 2020-09-01 10:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who will lower the temperature and bring the country together — not one who raises it and tears us further apart.  https://t.co/e6aFLx9iqU
1300811647200579589 2020-09-01 08:03:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our nation is at an inflection point. @KamalaHarris and I sat down to discuss what brought us to this moment — and how we move forward and build back better than before. Tune in to watch:  https://t.co/PlmeffTySN
1300804101677015042 2020-09-01 07:34:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Across the country, people rely on public transportation to get to work, see loved ones, and access essential services. But that's all under threat because Republicans refuse to do their jobs.  Congress must act now to save public transit.
1300609317872295936 2020-08-31 18:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today’s press conference made it clear: we are all less safe because Donald Trump has failed at his job.  We need a President who will stop violence — not incite it.  https://t.co/AhGNZCDQkr
1300606801356959744 2020-08-31 18:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Shri Pranab Mukherjee was a devout public servant who believed deeply in the importance of our two nations tackling global challenges together. Jill and I are saddened to hear of his passing — our prayers go out to his loved ones and the Indian people.  https://t.co/SJfaDEKjGi
1300604392148733952 2020-08-31 18:20:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> I urge President Trump to join me in saying that while peaceful protest is an important right — violence is wrong. Period.  If he can’t say that, then he is unfit to be President.  https://t.co/W4sjpF0Z3V
1300604391234379778 2020-08-31 18:20:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight, President Trump declined to rebuke violence.  He wouldn’t even repudiate one of his supporters who is charged with murder.  He is too weak, too scared of the hatred he has stirred to put an end to it.
1300599253207785472 2020-08-31 18:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Fear never builds the future — hope does.  https://t.co/V0jCGRBBG7
1300591702219132928 2020-08-31 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If Donald Trump wants to ask the question: Who will keep you safer as President?  Let’s answer it.  https://t.co/pDXCqzRbQe
1300583900503183360 2020-08-31 16:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump looks at this violence and sees a political lifeline.  He failed to protect America, so now he's trying to scare America.  https://t.co/BCoO4gS2zE
1300576603295158272 2020-08-31 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, we're just hours away from our first end-of-month fundraising deadline of the general election. We need your help to hit our goal and show Donald Trump we have what it takes to win in November.  If you're able, please chip in today:  https://t.co/8tOxeZGUM9
1300569556382085120 2020-08-31 16:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The truth is Donald Trump can't stop the violence, because for years he has fomented it.  https://t.co/nxqas2Uv5s
1300559741220016128 2020-08-31 15:23:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Anyone who met Amari will tell you that he was a charismatic young man—poised for greatness. He was ready and willing to take on the world. I can tell you that in 20 years, we all would have been saying, ‘Amari for President.’ #AmariForPresident  https://t.co/aa01lftpzt
1300500098233839616 2020-08-31 11:26:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> More cops have died from COVID this year than have been killed on patrol.  Nearly one in six small businesses in this country are closed.  Do you really feel safer under Trump?
1300496925129666561 2020-08-31 11:13:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mr. President, it’s high time you condemn violence of any form.
1300495317041729536 2020-08-31 11:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump keeps telling us if he was president, you'd feel safe.  Well, he is president — whether he knows it or not.
1300494058746458116 2020-08-31 11:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump and Pence are running on this: “You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.”  And what’s their proof?  The violence you’re seeing in Donald Trump’s America.
1300492800161583104 2020-08-31 10:57:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The simple truth is Donald Trump failed to protect America. So now, he’s trying to scare America.
1300491542000361473 2020-08-31 10:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I want a safe America — safe from COVID, safe from crime and looting, safe from racially motivated violence, safe from bad cops.   And let’s be crystal clear: Safe from four more years of Donald Trump.
1300490032042725377 2020-08-31 10:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump may believe mouthing the words law and order makes him strong, but his failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia in this country shows you how weak he is.
1300488129418129409 2020-08-31 10:38:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump can’t stop the violence we're seeing today – because for years he has fomented it.  Tune in as I discuss the need for justice and safety in America:  https://t.co/gSXuP0jc5D
1300471409735536642 2020-08-31 09:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Does anyone believe there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is reelected?
1300461343045083136 2020-08-31 08:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are facing so many crises under Donald Trump:   COVID. Economic devastation. Unwarranted police violence. Emboldened white nationalists. A reckoning on race. Declining faith in a bright American future.  The common thread? A president who makes things worse — not better.
1300448261321502720 2020-08-31 08:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re going to build back better and we will do it while creating a brighter future for you and your families. This week @KamalaHarris and I sit down to discuss how we are going to move forward—together.  Join us on Tuesday.  https://t.co/hebSifEEHL
1300403965201444866 2020-08-31 05:04:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There’s a lot happening, but I hope we don’t overlook the brave fire fighters &amp; emergency responders in the wake of Hurricane Laura.  When the storm hit, they stayed behind—even while their homes were being destroyed—to help their community recover.  True American heroes.
1300218744539619336 2020-08-30 16:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This video is doctored — and a flagrant attempt to spread misinformation at the expense of a man who uses assistive technology.   It should be removed. Now.
1300210188146946050 2020-08-30 16:14:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m thrilled to announce our grassroots fundraiser with our friends. I hope you’ll join @DrBiden, @JVN, @Karamo, @TanFrance, @Antoni, and @BobbyBerk this Tuesday.  Chip in to reserve your spot:  https://t.co/WV2DfZxixR  https://t.co/QmsevDhVSb
1300164708528533505 2020-08-30 13:13:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump has been president for almost four years.  The temperature in the country is higher, tensions run stronger, divisions run deeper.  And all of us are less safe because he can’t do the job of the American president.
1300164707081498630 2020-08-30 13:13:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must not become a country at war with ourselves.  A country that accepts the killing of fellow Americans who do not agree with you. A country that vows vengeance toward one another.  But that is the America that President Trump wants us to be, the America he believes we are.
1300164706007740416 2020-08-30 13:13:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> The deadly violence we saw overnight in Portland is unacceptable. Shooting in the streets of a great American city is unacceptable.  I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same.  https://t.co/JRuI7ya2Wv
1300100974711721984 2020-08-30 09:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> We run this campaign led by the values that guide my life - honesty, integrity, and compassion. @KamalaHarris and I are hard at work and want to let you into the conversation.  Join us this Tuesday.  https://t.co/zu0QDka23i
1300040570593783809 2020-08-30 05:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No lies, fear-mongering, or malarkey.  Just an honest conversation about the future of our nation.  Tune in this Tuesday.  https://t.co/yWc0ewazL4
1299851827442221057 2020-08-29 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe we're so much better than what we saw this week at the RNC.  This is our moment to choose love over hate, hope over fear, fact over fiction.  We'll overcome this era of American darkness, together.  https://t.co/QEMvt14wG8
1299846890725560323 2020-08-29 16:10:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> I don’t know a single person who believes any part of this pandemic has been a “good thing".  Secretary DeVos and President Trump refuse to take this virus seriously—our children are paying the price.   https://t.co/VYxH7JyWtM
1299791428621463552 2020-08-29 12:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe there's not a single thing the American people can't accomplish if we do it together. We're going to overcome these crises and emerge stronger than before.
1299761231620902913 2020-08-29 10:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, we’re just a few days away from our biggest end-of-month deadline yet and we need your help to hit our goal. Every donation — big or small — makes a big difference.  Please chip in today:  https://t.co/fobkAUPc7P
1299738581435445250 2020-08-29 09:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The only thing this president has done alone is fail America.  https://t.co/Jx2FDe3bTe
1299723485611130887 2020-08-29 08:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have a president more interested in beating people at golf than beating COVID-19.
1299693287184367616 2020-08-29 06:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> I promise you this: A Biden-Harris Administration will always listen to scientists.  https://t.co/zLuL3DYSI4
1299542508586885122 2020-08-28 20:00:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> The true power of @ChadwickBoseman was bigger than anything we saw on screen. From the Black Panther to Jackie Robinson, he inspired generations and showed them they can be anything they want — even super heroes. Jill and I are praying for his loved ones at this difficult time.
1299497492120326144 2020-08-28 17:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America was built on a simple idea: All men — and women — are created equal.   It’s time we ensured all people are treated equally as well.
1299481889003024384 2020-08-28 16:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The President incites violence, inspires white-supremacist shooters, and his failed COVID response is costing thousands of lives per day. When you look at the world right now, ask yourself: Do you feel safe in Trump’s America?  https://t.co/Ztp6TdSwKk
1299467041498263554 2020-08-28 15:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America is at an inflection point.  The calls for racial justice that sparked the March on Washington 57 years ago are ringing out again today.  As we honor the legacy of that day — let's meet this moment with the urgency and action that our heroes marched for half a century ago.  https://t.co/Bs0SccjnxN
1299451941987078146 2020-08-28 14:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump put our nation on the sidelines. Let’s get back in the game.  https://t.co/e8VsW5IsNi
1299445398935797760 2020-08-28 13:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know from personal experience how important access to quality, affordable health care is for a family. I know the peace of mind it brings.  It's why as president, I promise I'll protect your children's health care as if they were my own.  https://t.co/kqiKt8ISXj
1299435332358807554 2020-08-28 12:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As we mark the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech, we must continue the hard work of perfecting our union. It's up to all of us to carry on the march toward equality, liberty, and justice for all.
1299428285948899329 2020-08-28 12:27:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I am grateful for your friendship and leadership, @AbeShinzo. I’m sad to see you step down, but I know the strong alliance between our countries and peoples will continue for generations to come. Wishing you good health in the years ahead, my friend.  https://t.co/M0cMT5y9Dd
1299409914964533248 2020-08-28 11:14:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mr. President, Americans are canceling weddings and holding funerals without family. They're sacrificing so more Americans don't have to die.  But instead of leading by example, you hosted a super spreader event on the South Lawn.  When will you take the presidency seriously?
1299400100331040769 2020-08-28 10:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can't let George Floyd and Jacob Blake become just another pair of hashtags.  This is a moment of action.  It's long past time we reform policing, reverse systemic racism, and make our communities safer.
1299324602863292416 2020-08-28 05:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Times of crisis often bring out our best as Americans — and we're seeing that right now in the aftermath of Hurricane Laura. Thank you to all of our emergency responders who are working around the clock to help people get back on their feet.
1299189210641907713 2020-08-27 20:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight is yet another reminder of what's at stake in this election.   Who we are, what we stand for, and who we want to be — it's all on the ballot this November.  We have to beat Donald Trump. Chip in to help us do it:  https://t.co/dWIpEPQcqQ
1299186945558482945 2020-08-27 20:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s time we bring integrity back to the White House.  https://t.co/KDPLITstKA
1299184932384768001 2020-08-27 20:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Remember: every example of violence Donald Trump decries has happened on his watch. Under his leadership. During his presidency.
1299180253580066816 2020-08-27 20:01:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> Leadership requires foresight.
1299179647570120704 2020-08-27 19:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> From the moment COVID-19 emerged, President Trump downplayed the threat it posed, refused to listen to the experts, and failed to take action to contain its spread.  Now, we’re paying the price.
1299177885933039617 2020-08-27 19:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump promised to be the greatest jobs president God ever created.  Instead, tens of millions of Americans are out of work and we're facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. #PromisesBroken  https://t.co/JzjZu7KKRr
1299176879295873025 2020-08-27 19:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump didn't build a wall around America, the world built a wall around us.  https://t.co/lLY8S92cSb
1299174614434607104 2020-08-27 19:39:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is right, this is the most important election in the history of our country.  Chip in to help us get him out of the White House:  https://t.co/1Ve0clLACI
1299172852760014848 2020-08-27 19:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump calls himself a wartime president. But now, instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he’s waved the white flag.  He abandoned the American people when we needed him most.
1299170839410216961 2020-08-27 19:24:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When President Trump took office, he inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden administration. And just like everything else he’s inherited in his life, he squandered it.  https://t.co/tTBD8lRC1c
1299168574515286016 2020-08-27 19:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump has failed our nation.  https://t.co/w792IB79kK
1299166561299701763 2020-08-27 19:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> - 180,000 lives lost - Nearly 6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 - Over 25 million Americans out of work - Countless small businesses on the brink of closing  That's Donald Trump's America. We're living it every day. We can't take four more years.
1299164296329523200 2020-08-27 18:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When Donald Trump says tonight you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America, look around and ask yourself: How safe do you feel in Donald Trump’s America?
1299145925273612288 2020-08-27 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This news is deeply disturbing — as an alum of @UDelaware and as an American. We need a full and swift investigation into what happened Tuesday night.   With anti-Semitism on the rise across the country, we all have a moral obligation to speak out and give hate no safe harbor.
1299141898901299201 2020-08-27 17:29:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump doesn’t want a second term. He wants a do-over.  As he takes the stage tonight, remember: he alone is responsible for the chaos in our country.  Together, we can stop it.  https://t.co/iKcrLuEC9N
1299136865560268800 2020-08-27 17:09:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump and Republicans must have forgotten about the 180,000 American lives lost due to COVID-19.  I promise you that, as president, I never will.
1299129064234446850 2020-08-27 16:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I couldn't be more ready for @KamalaHarris to be the next Vice President.  Chip in to help us make history:  https://t.co/UzTdwLgkeM
1299107421818957824 2020-08-27 15:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Immigrants are not your political props, Mr. President.
1299086282308505601 2020-08-27 13:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Last night, Vice President Mike Pence stood before America and with a straight face said, “You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.”  His proof?  The violence you’re seeing in Donald Trump’s America.  https://t.co/4xx9Mj4bfZ
1299059992490721280 2020-08-27 12:03:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tune in as @KamalaHarris discusses President Trump’s failure to lead on COVID-19 and what a Biden-Harris administration will do differently:  https://t.co/XzT7AUrG3q
1299053063685038080 2020-08-27 11:36:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> They got it wrong the first time. They will get it wrong again.  https://t.co/X9SzwXUEgu
1299020599650648065 2020-08-27 09:27:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The cruelty of this president truly knows no bounds. We can’t let him gut Social Security and eliminate funding for disability benefits.
1299003235261444096 2020-08-27 08:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To lead America, you have to understand America.  I know how hard it is for folks who are sick, struggling, and wondering how they'll get through the day.  You deserve a president who will fight for you and lead our nation out of these crises. I'll get started on day one.  https://t.co/evrWlwqhh1
1298997698587176961 2020-08-27 07:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I are praying for the safety of those in the path of Hurricane Laura. If you are in an impacted area, please heed the advice of local officials.
1298823802747596801 2020-08-26 20:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The contrast tonight couldn't be clearer:  We can choose four more years of fear, division, and hate.  Or we can choose a different path — one of hope, unity, and light.  Let's overcome this era of darkness, together:  https://t.co/agUqzkqkXT
1298816001497108480 2020-08-26 19:54:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 180,000 people have died from this COVID crisis. And the heartbreaking truth is that it didn't have to happen this way.
1298813233214582784 2020-08-26 19:43:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This moment demands moral leadership. And these players answered by standing up, speaking out, and using their platform for good.  Now is not the time for silence.
1298784795875397632 2020-08-26 17:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 100 years ago today, the 19th Amendment was certified, giving some women the right to vote.  But we still have further to go.  We must carry forward the banner of equality and create that more perfect union we've always strived to be. #WomensEqualityDay  https://t.co/v46l5SyLJe
1298754093599485952 2020-08-26 15:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As we celebrate #WomensEqualityDay and the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, we have got to renew our efforts to protect the sacred right to vote.  Every eligible American should be able to make their voice heard at the ballot box. Period.
1298740252262072321 2020-08-26 14:53:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Amari was 16, not old enough to vote, but that didn't stop him from helping change the course of history. He brought his infectious passion and light to our campaign every day — and made us all better in the process. Jill and I are keeping his loved ones in our prayers.
1298697722304888833 2020-08-26 12:04:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Once again, a Black man — Jacob Blake — was shot by the police. In front of his children. It makes me sick.  Is this the country we want to be?  Needless violence won’t heal us. We need to end the violence — and peacefully come together to demand justice.  https://t.co/WdNqrxA3PK

1298655192234237953 2020-08-26 09:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know how to lead this nation through a crisis because I've done it before. I won't waste any time getting this virus under control and building our country back better.  https://t.co/HgBdR6VxUO
1298627006133874699 2020-08-26 07:23:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump can try and shift blame all he wants, but the fact is Maine's hardworking lobstermen and women are hurting under his watch.  They deserve better. And as President, I will work to protect the livelihood and safety of the fishing community.
1298613668784087041 2020-08-26 06:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I promise you that as president, I will protect America. I will protect you and your family. I will defend our nation from threats seen and unseen.  It's the least of what we should expect from an American president.
1298444302117298178 2020-08-25 19:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe the American people are ready for something better. This is our moment to prove hope is more powerful than fear, love is more powerful than hate, and light is more powerful than darkness.  Join us:  https://t.co/ml7NJ94Nks
1298416871369256961 2020-08-25 17:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When they say “the best is yet to come,” that’s a threat.  https://t.co/SoKKF9KQYO

1298343890760732673 2020-08-25 12:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 70 days.   https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M  https://t.co/ikyF4Nu9dC
1298330301048016898 2020-08-25 11:44:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Two years ago, we lost a genuine American hero, and to me, a true friend. John McCain never stopped pushing me and our nation to be better. I miss him dearly.  https://t.co/0xzoqjDFlP

1298069196228759562 2020-08-24 18:26:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> The only person responsible for our failed COVID response is Donald Trump.
1298054987394629633 2020-08-24 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Together, united in our love for America and each other, we’ll overcome this season of darkness and restore the soul of our nation.  https://t.co/9dPuQVa3CQ
1298045927148539904 2020-08-24 16:54:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This moment is bigger than any one political party. We've got to come together as Americans to save our democracy and restore the soul of our nation. Thank you, Senator @JeffFlake.
1297936455986290693 2020-08-24 09:39:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Yesterday, Jacob Blake was shot seven times in the back by police. His kids watched from the car. Today, we woke to grieve yet again.  We need a full and transparent investigation.  https://t.co/9X7l25nq8d
1297694360545484801 2020-08-23 17:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Obama and I established a White House office to prepare our nation for future pandemics. Donald Trump eliminated it — and we've been paying the price every single day.
1297667433239470081 2020-08-23 15:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, the first step I will take will be to get control of the virus that's ruined so many lives.   Because I understand something this president doesn't.    We will never get our economy back on track until we deal with this virus.
1297633459343708164 2020-08-23 13:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@DrBiden and I are keeping everyone in the path of storms Laura and Marco in our prayers. Please take steps to prepare, heed the warnings of local authorities, and stay safe.
1297617101666971648 2020-08-23 12:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America is at an inflection point.   We can choose the path of becoming angrier, less hopeful, and more divided.  Or we can choose a different path, and together, take this chance to heal, to be reborn, to unite. A path of hope and light.
1297595030002180099 2020-08-23 11:02:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> 31 years after they joined hands to demand freedom from Soviet oppression, citizens of the Baltic states formed a human chain in solidarity with Belarusians fighting to throw off the chains of dictatorship.  We stand with the people of Belarus as we stood with the Baltic nations.
1297570544867475458 2020-08-23 09:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I give you my word: If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us, not the worst. I will be an ally of the light, not of the darkness.
1297546385760419841 2020-08-23 07:49:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In times as challenging as these, I believe there is only one way forward: As a united America.  https://t.co/ZRssx1GB2o

1296969081745154049 2020-08-21 17:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I have always believed you can define America in one word: Possibilities.    In America, everyone should be given the opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them.
1296960021947916290 2020-08-21 16:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Together, we can and will rebuild our economy. And when we do, we'll not only build it back — we'll build it back better.  https://t.co/ieky2t09KE

Well, you summoned yours last night and showed the whole world that your stutter doesn't define you. I couldn't be prouder.

1296828908210286592 2020-08-21 08:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump continues to cozy up to Russia while Putin persecutes civil society and journalists.   Now, opposition leader Alexei Navalny is in a coma after being poisoned. It's unacceptable.   Unlike Trump, I'll defend our democratic values and stand up to autocrats like Putin.
1296662561740353536 2020-08-20 21:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You placed your faith in our campaign and I can’t thank you enough. I’m grateful for your support and honored to be the Democratic nominee.  With 75 days left, we’ve got to get to work. Chip in to help us win:  https://t.co/Kkref2smgA

1296552589106937856 2020-08-20 14:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The story of this campaign has had its ups and downs, but through its course we’ve brought our party and nation together. Now, it’s time for the final chapter.  Let’s do this.  https://t.co/FDEszl2lpD
1296538746171449344 2020-08-20 13:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> From my days as a public defender to my time as Vice President — I’ve dedicated my entire life to serving this country, and I’m not done yet.  https://t.co/1Ojc7u7dS0
1296527421391298560 2020-08-20 12:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight, I'll officially accept the nomination to be President of the United States of America. Before my speech, join us for a Grassroots Fest featuring James Taylor and Doug Emhoff.  Chip in now to reserve your spot:  https://t.co/Vxch9xBxz7  https://t.co/xG4JRePFDE
1296511566888579072 2020-08-20 11:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When I first launched my campaign, I said we're in a battle for the soul of this nation.   As I accept the nomination tonight, it's clear what's at stake in the next 75 days.   We can and will win. Join us in the fight:  https://t.co/vegxIzIAkN
1296482122832777221 2020-08-20 09:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19 — but he does bear full responsibility for the failed national response.   We've got to hold him accountable this November.
1296441102770286592 2020-08-20 06:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Last night we made history when we nominated @KamalaHarris to be the next Vice President.   Watch the highlights from night three of the #DemConvention:  https://t.co/YMLN65lVRV
1296429516307431424 2020-08-20 05:50:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@BarackObama led our nation back from the brink of economic collapse. He rallied the world to take on the scourge of terror and the threat of climate change. When he tells you that our democracy is on the line this fall: listen. Vote.   https://t.co/MtT1Nu2GVs
1296288346545717249 2020-08-19 20:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe there’s not a single thing we can’t do if we do it together. Chip in to help us build the movement that will beat Donald Trump and put me and @KamalaHarris in the White House.  https://t.co/3nXDORqfjB
1296286109652193280 2020-08-19 20:21:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Kamala Harris will be an incredible Vice President.  Now let’s get to work. We don’t have a minute to waste.
1296276722892124160 2020-08-19 19:43:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> “Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t.”
1296273498164404224 2020-08-19 19:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hillary: tonight, I’m reminded of one of your favorite sayings — rooted in the faith we both share: “Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can.”  Thanks for always living by that, and reminding us to do the same.
1296271988126814208 2020-08-19 19:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I authored the Violence Against Women Act, and as president I’ll expand our efforts to end gender-based violence. Thank you, @Mariska, @RuthMGlenn, and Carly Dryden for your courage and advocacy. Together, we’ll get this done. #DemConvention  https://t.co/2bjnlz4s1w
1296258902120517633 2020-08-19 18:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ll just say what @billieeilish said: vote like your life depends on it. #DemConvention  https://t.co/5ewebNvQGg
1296257643653165056 2020-08-19 18:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When I hear the words “climate change,” I hear another word: “jobs.” We can solve our climate crisis and our economic crisis at the same time. #DemConvention  https://t.co/PZQvGM2uTR
1296255630483894272 2020-08-19 18:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m doing this for Gabby. I’m doing this for so many families who have lost a loved one to gun violence. We’re going to be on the right side of history. #DemConvention  https://t.co/DhTCg1jmbr
1296255127158841345 2020-08-19 18:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I made a promise to families hurt by gun violence to never, ever give up on the fight. Tonight, I make the same promise to you. #DemConvention  https://t.co/9dWV7M5vXz
1296251855782031361 2020-08-19 18:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You heard @KamalaHarris: Your voice is your vote. So get prepared for the election and make a plan for how you’ll cast your ballot. #DemConvention  https://t.co/Hy8C4n0lUk
1296249856801902594 2020-08-19 17:57:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t go back to the way things were before these crises, because things weren’t working for far too many Americans.  Tonight, we’ll discuss our plans to build back better and set this nation on a new path.  https://t.co/N35wrjKcPj
1296246966381432833 2020-08-19 17:45:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> When Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, the President threw paper towels and abandoned the victims.  Turns out he even wanted to sell the island. He turned his back on Puerto Ricans, but I promise you this: I never will.
1296236756317200384 2020-08-19 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s make history tonight, @KamalaHarris.
1296224173161816064 2020-08-19 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The truth is, there's not a lot of people whose opinion I valued more than Beau's. When I was deciding who to pick as my running mate, I thought a lot about his friendship with @KamalaHarris and the respect he had for her.  I know he'd be proud of my choice.  https://t.co/Lv9E0KgwZG
1296195232858542083 2020-08-19 14:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> They say choosing your running mate is the most important decision you make when you’re running for president. Well, I’m confident I made the right choice.  Tonight, @KamalaHarris speaks directly to America. Tune in at 9 PM ET:  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50  https://t.co/0kFuobs91Z
1296176609788076034 2020-08-19 13:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You are the rock of our family, Jilly. I am and have always been in awe of you.  https://t.co/JjoUGatdWn
1296158742115827712 2020-08-19 11:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When it comes down to it, Kamala and Doug share the same basic values set that Jill and I do — and it all starts with family. It’s at the very core of who we are. And it’s why I’m confident they’re the best possible partners for the road ahead.  https://t.co/VXkmeyOybY
1296134834545283072 2020-08-19 10:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have the power to write the future we want for this country — and it starts at the ballot box this November.  Register to vote today and let’s get to work:  https://t.co/Hy8C4n0lUk  https://t.co/os2A8lhMIT
1296107655723921415 2020-08-19 08:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The brave citizens of Belarus are showing their voices will not be silenced by terror or torture. The U.S. should support Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya's call for fair elections. Russia must be told not to interfere—this is not about geopolitics but the right to choose one's leaders.
1296083244694216704 2020-08-19 06:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I might be a little biased, but I think @DrBiden gave the best speech in convention history last night.  Check it out along with other highlights from night two of the #DemConvention:  https://t.co/ZbwPoFYiMw
1295925706468274183 2020-08-18 20:29:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight made one thing clear: We need to restore real leadership to the White House — and we need to do it now. Chip in to help us make it happen.  https://t.co/4o4OT4ugJn
1295922106589487106 2020-08-18 20:14:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> ❤️  https://t.co/wNLkBpx69P
1295921176519364610 2020-08-18 20:11:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill loves fiercely, cares deeply, and nothing stops her when she sets her mind to making something right. For all of you across the country, just think of your favorite educator who gave you the confidence to believe in yourself. That’s the kind of First Lady Jill will be.
1295916143471808513 2020-08-18 19:51:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> John McCain was a good man, and a good friend. He made this country better. I miss him dearly. #DemConvention  https://t.co/TZ4cRY5fz4
1295912117065797633 2020-08-18 19:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you, @AdyBarkan for your courage and for all that you do to ensure a more just, more equal America. #DemConvention  https://t.co/JDqhwK719L
1295909097112395776 2020-08-18 19:23:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It is the honor of my life to accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States of America. #DemConvention
1295900540694433792 2020-08-18 18:49:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jacquelyn: Your nomination means the world to me. Thank you — and I hope you know: we love you back. #DemConvention  https://t.co/BDS1HQAxhM
1295898527566970880 2020-08-18 18:41:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@SallyQYates is right: This president has done nothing but use his position to benefit himself rather than our country #DemConvention  https://t.co/xgTEA2MYWs
1295896514150137857 2020-08-18 18:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I remember helping President Carter with his campaign back when I was a first-term Senator. I'm deeply honored to have his support today.  Thank you, Mr. President. #DemConvention  https://t.co/P7deAwTbzo
1295895507563245568 2020-08-18 18:29:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> These young leaders represent not just the next generation, but the diversity of our great nation. #DemConvention  https://t.co/bKpUrUbC0K
1295892991018639363 2020-08-18 18:19:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America is an idea stronger than any army and bigger than any ocean. It’s more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It offers hope. #DemConvention  https://t.co/93R8wxNzUk
1295887792078065665 2020-08-18 17:58:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> Last night, folks from across the country came together to show how much stronger we are when we stand united.  Looking forward to tonight where we'll talk about why leadership matters, and hear from my favorite #DemConvention speaker, @DrBiden.  https://t.co/7nunEqhK9C
1295864301845123073 2020-08-18 16:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are, what we stand for, and who we want to be — it's all at stake. We've got to beat Donald Trump.  Register to vote today to help us do it:  https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M
1295828315056623616 2020-08-18 14:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Be a patriot. Protect your fellow citizens. Wear a mask.
1295786288826601472 2020-08-18 11:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our nation was founded on a simple idea: All men—and women—are created equal.  We’ve never fully lived up to it, but we won’t stop trying.  As we mark the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, let’s make sure we don’t wait another 100 years to fulfill that founding promise.
1295759864648609795 2020-08-18 09:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump still doesn’t have a plan to get this virus under control. His failure to lead is costing American lives.   Here’s what I’ll do as president:  https://t.co/etpUGBkONZ  https://t.co/aK3GjwG4vw
1295720649055440896 2020-08-18 06:54:10 -0800 <JoeBiden> A good step forward. Yet President Trump continues to do everything he can to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.  I will defend the rights of all Americans to have access to quality, affordable health care, free from discrimination.   https://t.co/zOR0dXH1rt
1295574335047045120 2020-08-17 21:12:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight we saw that Americans are ready to come together, and that we the people can overcome these crises and emerge stronger than ever.   Chip in to help us beat Donald Trump and set our nation on a new path. #DemConvention    https://t.co/mSBDdj70eu
1295557782092025856 2020-08-17 20:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> "If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it."  #DemConvention  https://t.co/TDonFz6iHx
1295556022786875392 2020-08-17 20:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> "Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head...it is what it is."  #DemConvention  https://t.co/OArXv15lVV
1295554762302033921 2020-08-17 19:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> "A president's words have the power to move markets. They can start wars or broker peace. They can summon our better angels or awaken our worst instincts. You simply cannot fake your way through this job."  #DemConvention  https://t.co/ZH1EDg28Al
1295549729275707392 2020-08-17 19:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The leaders who ran in the 2020 primary with me represent the best of America. They made me a better candidate, and they make us a better nation.   I am proud to have their support. Together, we will defeat Donald Trump. #DemConvention  https://t.co/BOztd8iR0b
1295548722613493760 2020-08-17 19:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> “Out of many, Americans are one.” — @AmyKlobuchar #DemConvention  https://t.co/88d1V3kPmk
1295547715825344513 2020-08-17 19:27:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Governor @GretchenWhitmer — thank you for your support and for meeting the COVID-19 crisis with the urgency it demands. The people of Michigan are lucky to have you leading the way. #DemConvention  https://t.co/ef2d4DldRV
1295546205762727938 2020-08-17 19:21:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> "I believe that Americans have more in common than what divides us."   I couldn't agree more. What we need to do in both Alabama and Washington is to bring folks together. @DougJones knows that in his core. #DemConvention  https://t.co/EIoZDW8ucw
1295542102181523456 2020-08-17 19:04:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we want to build back better and deliver real change for the American people, then we've got to flip the U.S. Senate. And the path to doing so runs right through Maine. Thank you, @SaraGideon for being with us tonight. #DemConvention  https://t.co/1eyIpC81vC
1295539804030021637 2020-08-17 18:55:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> No family should go through the pain that Kristin and her family have gone through. #DemConvention  https://t.co/LgyabNxxFy

1295538656111820800 2020-08-17 18:51:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> George Floyd had a giving spirit. I see that in his family, I see that in his daughter.   George Floyd should be alive today. #DemConvention  https://t.co/hGqZysA5Ng
1295536656846594049 2020-08-17 18:43:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you, Congressman Clyburn.  https://t.co/8E3h8sjabu
1295536160224288771 2020-08-17 18:41:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> These last few months have been a wake-up call for our nation.

1295442776172240896 2020-08-17 12:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Secretary Esper and President Trump, it's a president's job to protect the health and safety of our troops and their families. Gutting the military health care system — no less during a global pandemic — is unacceptable.  https://t.co/lXpcSdm8au
1295412576126304257 2020-08-17 10:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There are only 78 days until Election Day — and @KamalaHarris and I need your help to make Donald Trump a one-term president.  Sign up today and let’s get to work:  https://t.co/lyhRyWPhvS

1295359475453440000 2020-08-17 06:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The hard truth is that our economy wasn't working for folks long before this crisis. It's why we can't just go back to the way things were — we have to build back better.   We've got to create an economy that works for everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected.
1295152109143433216 2020-08-16 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As Attorney General of the largest state in the country, @KamalaHarris took on the big banks over mortgage fraud, and Big Oil when they wanted to pollute without consequences.  She's the kind of fighter I need alongside me in the White House.
1295133234637025284 2020-08-16 16:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here’s my promise to you: If I’m elected president, I will always choose to unite rather than divide.   I’ll take responsibility instead of blaming others.   I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you.
1295114360268849152 2020-08-16 14:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump and Congress need to act now to deliver the relief the American people need.  https://t.co/YhlPXPspcS

1295012690755112967 2020-08-16 08:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need nationwide mask mandates.

I know the tremendous pain of losing a loved one — and I know how important family is in moments like these. I hope you know that our prayers are with you all.
1294787205030846465 2020-08-15 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can meet the challenge of COVID-19 and turn the corner on this pandemic. We just need a president and vice president ready and willing to lead.  https://t.co/HqfHD0qB4y

1294738131271348225 2020-08-15 13:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> William Perry Pendley has no business working at @blmnational and I'm happy to see his nomination to lead it withdrawn. In a Biden Administration, folks who spend their careers selling off public lands won't get anywhere near being tapped to protect them.  https://t.co/a0GsuoCVpn
1294715482298372098 2020-08-15 12:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This was a big week for our campaign: @KamalaHarris joined me on the ticket and we had our best fundraising week yet. Together, we are building the coalition that will beat Donald Trump.  Chip in if you’re able to keep the momentum going:  https://t.co/MIxfjbChaW
1294681508859576321 2020-08-15 10:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know a thing or two about being Vice President — and I know @KamalaHarris is the best partner I could have for the fight ahead.
1294658859190059009 2020-08-15 08:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Come January, there won’t be any time to waste repairing the damage of the last four years and beginning the work of building back better.  @KamalaHarris and I are ready to get to work on day one.  https://t.co/xEkEVwTHs6
1294636713051131909 2020-08-15 07:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump has had a lot of failures in his career, but he knows how to do one thing well: inherit something great and squander it. And never take any responsibility.  https://t.co/mDTSFogeUW

1294400909640900608 2020-08-14 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know just how important Social Security is for countless Americans. That's why as president, I'll protect and strengthen it — not defund it.
1294382034899677184 2020-08-14 14:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This afternoon, @KamalaHarris and I filled out our paperwork to get on the ballot in November.  Now, we're counting on you to do your part to make sure you're set to vote.  Get registered today:  https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M  https://t.co/JzAonY8TCg
1294374485093543936 2020-08-14 13:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The fate of Social Security is on the ballot in November. As President, I will never, ever defund Social Security. I’ll strengthen it.  Anything less is a failure of a president’s most important duty: to care for the American people.  https://t.co/1GaFbdd6u7
1294350074399449089 2020-08-14 12:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> People are losing their homes. Millions have already lost their paychecks. Our country is in crisis.  The virus isn’t taking a break — Republicans shouldn’t either. The House did their job. President Trump, bring the Senate back and pass a relief bill. Now.
1294336737012068355 2020-08-14 11:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> What kind of president tries to defund Social Security during an economic crisis?  https://t.co/FO47IjABTF
1294323650254868481 2020-08-14 10:23:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Voting by mail is safe and secure. And don't take my word for it: Take it from the President, who just requested his mail-in ballot for the Florida primary on Tuesday.
1294297729678495744 2020-08-14 08:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today marks 85 years since the Social Security Act was signed into law, providing protection for the most vulnerable. Now we’re living in a moment where we must strengthen our commitment to Social Security — not defund it.
1294280868605956098 2020-08-14 07:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The choice we make this November will decide the future of America.  I have no doubt @KamalaHarris is the right partner to join me to lead our nation through this moment.  https://t.co/YdJFksiCrI

They grew close while fighting to take on the big banks — and he had enormous respect for her and her work.  There is no one’s opinion I valued more than Beau’s, and I’m proud to have Kamala standing with me on this campaign.

1293735273201770496 2020-08-12 19:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When I called @KamalaHarris yesterday to ask her to be my running mate, I wanted to make sure Jill and Doug got to say hello.   You’re honorary Bidens now!  https://t.co/IILUjB6WfY
1293690095762104320 2020-08-12 16:25:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> Heather Heyer was a brave young woman who saw what was happening in her hometown of Charlottesville and decided to fight against it.   Let us honor her memory by continuing to stand against hate.
1293690094554099713 2020-08-12 16:25:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> Three years ago today, white supremacists descended on Charlottesville with torches in hand and hate in their hearts. Our president said they were "very fine people."   It was clear then, and it's clear now: We are in a battle for the soul of our nation, and we must win.
1293666570523168769 2020-08-12 14:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let's get to work, @KamalaHarris.  https://t.co/EjtUpgaieI
1293659775796776961 2020-08-12 14:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> One of the reasons I chose @KamalaHarris is because we both believe you can define America in one simple word — possibilities.
1293658014197710850 2020-08-12 14:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If you’re worried about whether you’ll have a job, worried about the poisons in the air you breathe and water you drink, worried about your civil rights or even your basic dignity being under attack—@KamalaHarris has had your back. Now, we have to have hers.
1293657007522811912 2020-08-12 14:14:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Working families need someone on their side...because they certainly don’t have anyone on their side with this president.   That’s going to change in the Biden-Harris administration.
1293654742820777984 2020-08-12 14:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This morning, little girls woke up across this nation — especially Black and Brown girls who so often may feel overlooked and undervalued in our society — potentially seeing themselves in a new way: As the stuff of Presidents and Vice Presidents.
1293653486454833156 2020-08-12 14:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’ve all watched @KamalaHarris in the Senate go toe-to-toe with Trump officials trying to hide the truth, asking the tough questions that need to be asked — and not stopping until she gets an answer. She’s ready to do this job.
1293651338157412352 2020-08-12 13:51:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> This afternoon, @KamalaHarris and I will be speaking together for the first time since yesterday’s big announcement. Tune in:  https://t.co/xoRbSqGta8
1293593087172730880 2020-08-12 10:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Whether it's taking on the big banks or pushing for marriage equality—Kamala never shies away from fighting tooth and nail for what's right. It's why I chose her to be my running mate.  She'll wake up every day thinking about how to make life better for the people of our country.
1293569178838929416 2020-08-12 08:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, @KamalaHarris grew up believing in the promise of America because she saw it firsthand.  Together, Kamala and I are going to fight every single day in the White House to make sure that promise is fulfilled for all Americans.
1293554330851827712 2020-08-12 07:26:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If @KamalaHarris and I are elected, we’re going to inherit multiple crises, a nation divided, and a world in disarray. We won’t have a minute to waste.   That's exactly why I picked her: She's ready to lead on day one.

That’s exactly what this moment calls for: action. And we hope you’ll take action with us:  https://t.co/K3mVwfTxXJ  https://t.co/MZLAx9IN6C
1293517596323655680 2020-08-12 05:00:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> Right now, America faces:    - The worst pandemic in 100 years - The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression - The most powerful calls for racial justice in a generation   I need someone alongside me who's smart, tough, and ready to lead. @KamalaHarris is that person.
1293382196925837312 2020-08-11 20:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thanks to supporters like you, we are on track to have our biggest fundraising day ever. Together, we can win this.  Join us.  https://t.co/B7uyMcat6n
1293340421444124672 2020-08-11 17:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s go win this, @KamalaHarris.  https://t.co/O2EYo6rYyk
1293280412144267264 2020-08-11 13:17:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> Back when Kamala was Attorney General, she worked closely with Beau. I watched as they took on the big banks, lifted up working people, and protected women and kids from abuse. I was proud then, and I'm proud now to have her as my partner in this campaign.
1293280411150217219 2020-08-11 13:17:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> I have the great honor to announce that I’ve picked @KamalaHarris — a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country’s finest public servants — as my running mate.
1293215600680951810 2020-08-11 09:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Don't forget that in the middle of this pandemic, the Trump Administration is in court trying to eliminate Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's heartless.  I'll protect and build on the ACA to ensure everyone gets the care they need.  https://t.co/IwFG48ED9h
1293175334037262336 2020-08-11 06:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I promise you if I'm elected, I won't waste any time getting this virus under control.  I'll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on. I'll bring together top experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.  We'll get it done, together.
1293012127708516353 2020-08-10 19:31:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is the latest dire consequence of Donald Trump looking the other way on Beijing's repression in Hong Kong. Instead of standing for freedom and democracy, he consistently stands with Xi Jinping.  I'll put American values back at the center of our foreign policy.
1292984073317646338 2020-08-10 17:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Social Security is the bedrock of American retirement — giving countless Americans peace of mind and the ability to retire with dignity. I've been fighting to protect and expand the program throughout my career — and I'll continue that fight as president.
1292951358027362304 2020-08-10 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, we need to listen to our frontline heroes. Wear a mask. It’s not just about you. It’s about keeping your family, neighbors, and fellow citizens safe.  https://t.co/pbI6UVhqvh
1292928711243771911 2020-08-10 14:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Bristol Bay is no place for a mine — our administration decided that in 2014. We're only discussing it today because Donald Trump's EPA reversed course hours after a closed-door meeting with the mining company's CEO.  https://t.co/RG38v0dRDk
1292924430272921606 2020-08-10 13:43:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump said that if he’s re-elected, he’ll defund Social Security.  We can't let that happen.
1292888443261919232 2020-08-10 11:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump keeps attacking the U.S. Postal Service, and now hundreds of thousands of veterans aren't getting their life-saving medications on time. It's despicable.  I promise you that as president, I will never put politics over the care of our nation's veterans.
1292870827168342017 2020-08-10 10:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump’s surrender to the pandemic has led to a resurgence of the virus and more economic pain and anxiety for millions of Americans.   After six months of a nation in crisis, he still has no plan to get us through. But I do:  https://t.co/SOVOPL7uPy
1292841887401992193 2020-08-10 08:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To the millions of Americans struggling to get by right now — those who can't find a job or pay the bills: I want you to know that I see you, and I won't forget you — and I'm going to fight every day in the White House to build an economy that works for you.
1292573870281629697 2020-08-09 14:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every single eligible American should have the opportunity to vote-by-mail this November. If it's good enough for Donald Trump — then it's good enough for you and me.
1292539896465416192 2020-08-09 12:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t let Donald Trump destroy the U.S. Postal Service.
1292505925685633025 2020-08-09 10:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's been six years since Michael Brown's life was taken in Ferguson — reigniting a movement. We must continue the work of tackling systemic racism and reforming policing.
1292475731172261894 2020-08-09 08:00:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our planet can’t take four more years of Donald Trump. We have to get him out of the White House so we can start treating the climate crisis like the urgent threat it is.
1292445526005252096 2020-08-09 06:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Giving the Trump administration another four years in office would have catastrophic implications for future generations. His victory would threaten the future of our democracy, and we must vote him out this November.  https://t.co/iIFPTIB1Er
1292264334287044609 2020-08-08 18:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> The United States just passed 5 million reported infections of COVID-19. It’s a number that boggles the mind and breaks the heart. Each time the number goes up, it represents a life altered, a family stricken with anxiety, a community on edge. It shouldn’t have gotten this bad.
1292256781826052097 2020-08-08 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, Donald Trump stated that if re-elected, he'll undermine the entire financial footing of Social Security.  Our seniors and millions of Americans with disabilities are under enough stress without their hard-earned Social Security benefits in doubt.  https://t.co/glUDQlcbEO
1292249233316130816 2020-08-08 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump has refused to take serious action to combat the COVID-19 crisis. And as a result, he got what he’s always wanted — the U.S. isolated from the rest of the world.  https://t.co/owvNL4ul74
1292226583101497344 2020-08-08 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s an important choice, and I want you to be one of the first to know who I’ve picked as my running mate – text FIRST to 30330 to get notified when I’ve made my decision.
1292207707894685696 2020-08-08 14:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Between the coronavirus and the economic crisis, this is a tough time for our country, I know. But I firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. Together, we will climb out of these crises and emerge stronger than before.
1292173738910216192 2020-08-08 12:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> The fact is, Donald Trump left our nation unprepared and unprotected for the worst public health crisis of our lifetime — and we're paying the price every single day.  https://t.co/sZJCdivRo3
1292139760195178498 2020-08-08 09:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our nation is desperate for leadership — leadership that can unite us and steer us through these crises. But at the most critical moment of his presidency, Donald Trump has nothing to offer.
1292113338357489666 2020-08-08 08:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I'll promise you this: when I'm President we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better.
1292083142308687872 2020-08-08 06:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> John Lewis will be remembered as a moral giant who dedicated his life to creating a more just, equal, and moral America.  Donald Trump will not.  https://t.co/vfZFeCUX3S
1291899426408079364 2020-08-07 17:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I can’t believe I have to say this, but we can’t let Donald Trump open up the Grand Canyon for uranium mining.
1291869982196809728 2020-08-07 15:53:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe every American deserves a fair shot at success — not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd. That’s why as president, I’ll reverse Donald Trump’s giant tax giveaways to the super-wealthy and big corporations, and build an economy that works for everyone.
1291837770080583688 2020-08-07 13:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It didn't have to be this bad.  https://t.co/xwdxgizLLH
1291816882434121728 2020-08-07 12:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here’s the truth—Donald Trump turned his back on the middle class long before COVID-19. He cut taxes for the super-wealthy, drove U.S. manufacturing into a recession, and stacked the deck against hardworking Americans.  It's time we pick a different path.  https://t.co/rt5RD9WOGA
1291784921841688578 2020-08-07 10:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Make no mistake: This economic crisis is due to President Trump’s failure to get this virus under control.  https://t.co/CBbk6SV39Q
1291762273023737858 2020-08-07 08:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> While I am grateful for the people who got their jobs back, my heart goes out to the more than 16 million Americans still out of work. The truth is it didn't have to be this bad, but Donald Trump failed to act. He's the one person who should lose his job.  https://t.co/eIHGRjwJd3
1291690890566737920 2020-08-07 04:01:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> The truth is that President Trump could have acted months ago to curb this pandemic—it's obvious he still hasn’t learned his lesson. He continues to ignore the warnings of health experts and we're all paying the price.  https://t.co/JOgA5Gpop4
1291690889874743296 2020-08-07 04:01:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here’s how COVID-19 affected Arizonans under the Trump—Ducey model:  - An infection rate—still—of nearly 20% - The fifth-highest number of current hospitalizations in the country - More than 4,000 deaths from COVID-19 - More than 183,000 cases - Lengthy delays in test results
1291690889174228992 2020-08-07 04:01:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> Gov. Ducey is rushing reopening without adequate testing and contact tracing.  He’s withholding support for increased testing and making local leaders plead for it.  He’s refusing to implement a mask mandate and turning his back on older Americans and those at greater risk.
1291690888477970432 2020-08-07 04:01:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump called Arizona “a model for applying a science-based approach to the decreasing cases and hospitalizations without implementing a punishing lockdown.” He said Governor Ducey’s approach should be used by other states—but here’s what’s really happening in Arizona:
1291540508796428290 2020-08-06 18:03:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> My commitment to you is this: I will always listen, I will never stop fighting for the African American community and I will never stop fighting for a more equitable future.
1291540508091854849 2020-08-06 18:03:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> Throughout my career I've witnessed the diversity of thought, background, and sentiment within the African American community. It's this diversity that makes our workplaces, communities, and country a better place.
1291540507416559617 2020-08-06 18:03:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> Earlier today, I made some comments about diversity in the African American and Latino communities that I want to clarify. In no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith—not by identity, not on issues, not at all.
1291528230395162629 2020-08-06 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe that the right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. To protect it, we’ve got to:  - Pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act - Enact automatic and same-day voter registration - Stand up to Republican voter suppression efforts
1291513130745561088 2020-08-06 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> John Lewis left us with marching orders. It’s up to all of us to carry them out:  https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M  https://t.co/MTc6WHNnSR
1291495515180285952 2020-08-06 15:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every moment with your loved ones is precious. I know that in my core because I’ve learned it through loss. It's why as president, I'm going to do everything I can to get this virus under control and get our lives back to normal as soon as we can.  https://t.co/qCsvryHMai
1291470348928475136 2020-08-06 13:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be clear: Voting is a right — not a privilege. Anyone who tells you otherwise can’t be trusted to hold the highest office in this land.
1291445184635387904 2020-08-06 11:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The fight for civil rights is what drove me to get involved in politics in the first place. It's why I fought for and helped secure a 25-year extension of the Voting Rights Act. And it's why as president, I'll immediately sign the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act into law.  https://t.co/fHqUvYahRR
1291419262788263938 2020-08-06 10:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 55 years ago today, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law — bringing us one step closer to that more perfect union. As we mark its anniversary, we’ve got to continue our fight to restore the VRA and protect the sacred right to vote.
1291409699393482753 2020-08-06 09:24:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The scenes of death and destruction from Hiroshima and Nagasaki still horrify us 75 years later. They reach through history to remind us of the hideous damage nuclear weapons can inflict—and our collective responsibility to ensure they're never again used.  https://t.co/357jRzBPeL
1291369685821186048 2020-08-06 06:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If I'm elected president, our students and educators will have all the tools and resources they need to succeed and get through COVID-19.  https://t.co/ul9vTTcT40
1291172134341840896 2020-08-05 17:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump promised to bring back jobs, but his policies crushed the manufacturing sector—and that was true even before COVID-19.  I’ll revitalize American manufacturing and innovation and create millions of good-paying jobs so we can build back better.  https://t.co/HrOOkWWQof
1291158292786544643 2020-08-05 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Growing up in Scranton, I learned the importance of hard work, treating others with dignity and respect, and leaving no one behind. Those values have guided my entire life — and they're the values I'll bring back to the White House.  https://t.co/aelfrxaISg
1291146968136323073 2020-08-05 16:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, a lot of you have been asking when I’m announcing my running mate, and I promise I’ll let you know soon. But here’s what I can tell you right now: I’m going to tell my supporters first — so text FIRST to 30330 to be the first to know.
1291139418732937217 2020-08-05 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I don’t buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past. As president, I'll make bold investments in American manufacturing, industry, and innovation to make sure the future is made in America — by all of America.  https://t.co/LkIi8g6M5i
1291111736167211008 2020-08-05 13:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There's been a lot of talk about my vetting process lately. Here’s an inside look:  https://t.co/tFRKJOE3hi
1291090345103679494 2020-08-05 12:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Weapons of war have no place in our communities. When I was a senator, I took on the @NRA and secured a 10-year ban on assault weapons — and as president, I’ll ban these weapons again.  https://t.co/ggqSaj40EJ
1291075245751832576 2020-08-05 11:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Eight years ago, a white supremacist targeted a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, WI — ultimately taking seven lives in an unspeakable act of terror. To truly honor those we lost, it's up to all of us to stand up to bigotry in our lives, give hate no safe harbor, and reduce gun violence.
1291042027212140546 2020-08-05 09:03:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I truly believe that we can revitalize American manufacturing and create a better economy at the same time. I want to build an economy that brings everyone along — one that works for the middle class, not just the wealthy and well-connected.  https://t.co/3fYbFfsvDb
1290998489975885826 2020-08-05 06:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The truth of the matter is, Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he inherited in his life, he squandered it.  https://t.co/EPxDx4ecoU
1290812262744305665 2020-08-04 17:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> From day one, Donald Trump downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, ignored scientists, and refused to take action.   Now, nearly 5 million cases and more than 150,000 deaths later, it's crystal clear we're paying the price for his failed leadership.
1290792130345082880 2020-08-04 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On day one, I’ll send a bill to Congress creating a clear roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and the 11 million undocumented people already strengthening our nation. It’s long overdue.  https://t.co/ajO7uUb9po
1290779547072253955 2020-08-04 15:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our hearts and prayers are with the people of Lebanon, and the victims of the horrific explosion in Beirut. I urge both the Trump Administration and international community to immediately mobilize assistance to the thousands injured in the blast.
1290757401243602944 2020-08-04 14:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thousands of Americans are dying every week. The President's response?  "It is what it is."  https://t.co/GT59hr14kb
1290749599775260672 2020-08-04 13:41:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ll get to work on day one enacting the changes needed to help the Latino community thrive.  Read my full plan here:  https://t.co/SaL4WaFkEA  https://t.co/vhwTRcwHlO
1290721665836388352 2020-08-04 11:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Happy birthday to my brother and friend, @BarackObama! Serving alongside you for eight years was the greatest honor of my life — and I'm grateful to have you by my side for these next 91 days.  https://t.co/qLl42Im40C
1290713612630228992 2020-08-04 11:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t just build back to the way things were before these crises. We have to build a more inclusive, equitable future for all.  Here’s how we’ll do it:  https://t.co/SaL4WanJN2  https://t.co/IeMtNqBynx
1290675360682500096 2020-08-04 08:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Latino community is bearing disproportionate harm from this pandemic. But even before, many Latino families were already struggling. We've got to do better. That's why today, I'm releasing my new agenda for the Latino community:  https://t.co/xgGUoleGQO
1290670187482624006 2020-08-04 08:25:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I’ll take on the powerful gun lobby to pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and close loopholes to keep guns out of dangerous hands. We can and will end our gun violence epidemic.
1290670186794815491 2020-08-04 08:25:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> One year ago, just hours after the massacre in El Paso, nine precious lives were cut short in Dayton. In the wake of the tragedies, Donald Trump promised the most modest of gun safety policies, then caved to the @NRA and failed to deliver.
1290610936022171655 2020-08-04 04:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On July 1st, Donald Trump predicted the coronavirus was going to "just disappear."  He was wrong — and more than 25,000 Americans died due to the virus last month.  Mr. President, step up and do your job before even more American families feel the pain of losing a loved one.
1290462206094708739 2020-08-03 18:39:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs. Period.  We’re going to make sure the future is made in America — by all of America:  https://t.co/uTI6GyuTpX
1290452895385583616 2020-08-03 18:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Not a joke, folks.  Get yours today:  https://t.co/RqCQJE8Kho  https://t.co/A1CNMOu2ct
1290433517000613890 2020-08-03 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every American should be able to safely make their voice heard this November. We need to:  - Expand vote-by-mail and early voting - Implement online voter registration - Make it safe and easy to vote in-person
1290424205633368066 2020-08-03 16:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I mourn the loss of the nine service members who perished in a training accident off the coast of California. These brave young men made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their fellow Americans. Our deepest condolences go out to their families.
1290402059905376259 2020-08-03 14:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> John Hume committed his life to the principles of nonviolence, and through his faith, statesmanship, and perseverance, he helped bring Northern Ireland through the Troubles to a better tomorrow. Jill and I send our condolences to the entire Hume family.  https://t.co/5QmRsj2fSb
1290383185432305666 2020-08-03 13:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the days that followed the El Paso shooting, I said Americans have to come together, stand against hate, and leave nobody behind.  That charge feels more important than ever. This is our fight — and together, we will win.  https://t.co/eX2xD0jhjX
1290350721515139072 2020-08-03 11:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's hard to believe this has to be said, but if I'm elected president, I’ll spend my Monday mornings working with our nation’s top experts to control this virus — not insulting them on Twitter.
1290337132339486722 2020-08-03 10:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is a moment to summon the purpose we felt one year ago after El Paso. A moment to recommit to the battle for the soul of this nation. A battle against white supremacy, hatred, and gun violence.  It won't be easy — but it's a battle we must win.
1290311966247006209 2020-08-03 08:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> One year ago, a white supremacist armed with a semi-automatic rifle targeted the people of El Paso. He thought his hatred of Latinos and immigrants would prove more powerful than the culture and vibrancy of the community.  He was wrong.  https://t.co/d7ISze6dK7
1290071129172791296 2020-08-02 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, there's simply too much at stake this November for anyone to sit on the sidelines. Register to vote today — and then reach out to five friends and get them registered as well.  https://t.co/8XWNjhwJzL
1290031870596403200 2020-08-02 14:09:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Welcome home, Bob and Doug! The first American splashdown in 45 years was executed with precision, and is truly a victory for American innovation and persistence. Congratulations to everyone involved on a successful conclusion to this historic mission.  https://t.co/kYBNCHL75O
1290030423951646720 2020-08-02 14:03:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> Join us as we host a roundtable with Congresswoman Veronica Escobar to commemorate the anniversary of the El Paso Massacre:  https://t.co/LPA5wDYvNF
1289999407979454465 2020-08-02 12:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s not enough to just go back to the way things were before these crises — we need to build back better than ever. We have to create a new American economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead.
1289964174575976449 2020-08-02 09:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Now more than ever, we need a president who believes in science.
1289932717417734144 2020-08-02 07:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This pandemic has put a bright light on the disparities that have plagued our nation for too long. We’ve got to make sure these communities get the help they need now — and root out the systemic racism that created these inequalities in the first place.  https://t.co/KZZx2T9ojT
1289712264468193280 2020-08-01 16:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Enhanced unemployment benefits expired for millions overnight.  We don’t have an effective nationwide testing program or a plan to control the virus.  Our health care workers still don’t have enough PPE.  Enough with the weekend golf trips, Mr. President. Do your job.
1289681058871545856 2020-08-01 14:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Rent is due today.  Donald Trump abdicated his responsibility to lead us out of this COVID-19 crisis—and we now face a potential housing crisis because of it.  Mr. President: Act now to make sure Americans don't have to choose between a roof over their heads or food on the table.  https://t.co/b0Uoy5qoFr
1289663442874281985 2020-08-01 13:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You have enough on your plate — you shouldn't also have to worry about the president making things even tougher for you.  https://t.co/HjwhG8kQMT
1289626952530354177 2020-08-01 11:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we give Donald Trump four more years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of this nation.  We can’t let that happen.
1289585429176446976 2020-08-01 08:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To the millions of people who get up every single day and make this country run: I see you, and I promise I will never stop fighting for you. You are the backbone of America.  https://t.co/009KRZx9Bq
1289541388686643202 2020-08-01 05:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ordinary people doing extraordinary things. That's the story of America — and it's being written every day by folks like Dr. @Craig_A_Spencer, who fought the Ebola outbreak and now COVID-19. @BarackObama and I called to thank him for his service and discuss the moment we're in.  https://t.co/wO14pwaaxa
1289349876590039040 2020-07-31 16:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, we’re just a few hours away from our critical end-of-month fundraising deadline. We need everyone to step up so we can hit our goal and make sure we can go toe-to-toe with President Trump.  If you're able, please chip in today:  https://t.co/XAsy8zaW2v
1289320181269921793 2020-07-31 15:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I are keeping everyone in the path of Hurricane Isaias in our prayers. We must ensure that our fellow Americans, in Puerto Rico and across the East Coast, get the support they need. Please heed the warnings from authorities, take steps to prepare, and stay safe.
1289301306645995521 2020-07-31 13:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Together, we're going to make sure the future is made in America — by all of America.  https://t.co/HX4zat4BVK
1289276644469874689 2020-07-31 12:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Grassroots donations are the backbone of our campaign — and we want to thank you for all your help. So tonight, Senator @ewarren and I are hosting an event that you won’t want to miss.  Chip in to reserve your spot:  https://t.co/KUyaCEAUi8  https://t.co/TiQzQ8tba7
1289245690539933696 2020-07-31 10:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re facing some of the biggest challenges in our history — and it’s abundantly clear Donald Trump just isn’t up for the job.  We need real leadership — and we need it now.
1289195358518738950 2020-07-31 06:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s been over six months since the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States, and President Trump still doesn't have an effective plan to contain its spread. It's an unjustifiable failure of leadership that costs lives every day.
1289030018983776256 2020-07-30 19:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@DrBiden and I wish all our Muslim friends and neighbors a blessed #EidAlAdha. May your sacrifices on this day be accepted and strengthen you during these challenging times. Eid Mubarak!
1289001833185316865 2020-07-30 17:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Human trafficking is an unconscionable attack on the dignity of the most vulnerable among us. Action can’t wait — on this World Day Against Trafficking in Persons, we’ve got to join together and commit to ending trafficking. #EndHumanTrafficking  https://t.co/5UJHwaMRQI
1288980193831337984 2020-07-30 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You won't have to worry about my tweets when I'm president.
1288967733695205376 2020-07-30 15:40:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Bill Barr is the Attorney General of the United States — not the president's private attorney.  https://t.co/XVfyErCZu9
1288950495307071491 2020-07-30 14:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 55 years ago today, Medicare and Medicaid were signed into law. And ever since, they've extended lives, enhanced liberty, and put the pursuit of happiness within reach for millions.  I'll protect and expand these programs for generations to come.  https://t.co/haLz46TAOD
1288942945555476480 2020-07-30 14:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Throughout his life, John Lewis taught us that while the journey toward equality is not easy, we must be unafraid and never cower and never, ever give up.  It's up to all of us to carry on his mission.  https://t.co/VUJdegsBuw
1288926084306624518 2020-07-30 12:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s time Senate Republicans back their effusive praise of John Lewis with action. Pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act.
1288890852304023552 2020-07-30 10:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Even after his passing, John Lewis reminds us that the most powerful symbol of what it means to be an American is what we do with the time we have to make real the promise of our nation.  May his words guide us as we march on toward November.  https://t.co/wmxgIqDDAi
1288875249493315584 2020-07-30 09:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The last three months were the worst period for economic growth our nation has experienced in the 70 years since we started measuring it — a drop of nearly 33 percent.  Let's be clear: This is no act of God, it's a failure of presidential leadership.  https://t.co/pPZXkHtJcR
1288806550572687365 2020-07-30 05:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm the proud husband of a teacher. I've seen firsthand how difficult the job can be in normal times — let alone in the middle of a pandemic. So when I heard Beth's story, I knew @BarackObama and I had to give her a call.  https://t.co/xBdeItoMW6
1288629127507898370 2020-07-29 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump's instinct to constantly add fuel to the fire is the last thing our country needs right now.  We need leadership that will calm the waters and lower the temperature.  https://t.co/tNUQUYDO8P
1288603961948340225 2020-07-29 15:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who will bring us together instead of tearing us apart and who will enforce the law faithfully rather than put his own political interests first.
1288573762812559362 2020-07-29 13:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, I'm excited to share that Senator @ewarren and I are hosting a grassroots fundraiser this Friday — and you're invited. We're going to chat about what's at stake this November and even answer a few of your questions.  Chip in any amount to join us:  https://t.co/Ak0FXcwfoV  https://t.co/j6OGUieI46
1288564199723921408 2020-07-29 12:57:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump has shown that he can’t beat the pandemic or turn the economy around. And he is unsurprisingly stoking the flames of division for political gain.  He is the worst possible person to lead our nation through this moment.  https://t.co/CfJzEwU6Cm
1288546080507002892 2020-07-29 11:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My heart goes out to Jessica and the countless others across the nation who have lost a loved one due to COVID-19. Behind every number we see in the news is a family and community that will never again be whole — and we can't forget that.  https://t.co/S2NrhkXrHI
1288539285818413057 2020-07-29 11:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congratulations to California Child Care Providers United on a successful election. As president, I'll make it easier for child care workers to unionize — and I’ll provide resources so they earn higher wages while also making care more affordable. #ChildCareIsEssential
1288508836232347648 2020-07-29 09:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need an effective, coordinated nationwide testing and tracing program. We need more PPE for health care workers. We need a comprehensive plan to get this virus under control.  We need this president to do his job.
1288467563006046208 2020-07-29 06:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I have no illusions about how tough the road ahead is. But I’m optimistic for one reason above all others: I know the history and the heart of this country.  There is nothing we're unable to achieve when we do it together.
1288276806131302400 2020-07-28 17:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Listen to the scientists: Wear a mask.  https://t.co/9CFioW4wvS
1288264223475335170 2020-07-28 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump voted by mail. You should be able to as well.
1288246606983122944 2020-07-28 15:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Small business ownership is one of our country's cornerstones for wealth building and job creation. But Black and Brown entrepreneurs face far too many barriers to ownership, growth, and success.  I've got a plan to change that:  https://t.co/27Y38un2tM  https://t.co/MF7OpMS7bA
1288230249340309508 2020-07-28 14:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America has never lived up to our founding promise — and we can’t rest until we finally do. My new plan will advance racial equity across the American economy and bring us closer to reaching our highest ideals:  https://t.co/27Y38u5rCe  https://t.co/pQGZ78PXwC
1288200050443771907 2020-07-28 12:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My housing plan will give a $15,000 tax credit to first-time home-buyers, expand affordable housing, and reverse President Trump’s efforts to gut fair housing enforcement.  We're going to remove the barriers to homeownership that hold back too many Americans of color.
1288199043735142401 2020-07-28 12:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To support more Black and Brown small businesses, my administration will launch a new Small Business Opportunity Initiative. We're going to make sure that those with the best ideas are not denied the venture capital or financing they need because of their race or zip code.
1288197282064510976 2020-07-28 12:39:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In good times, communities of color still lag. In bad times, they get hit first and the hardest. And in recovery, they take the longest to bounce back.  We have to break the cycle, and I’ve got a plan to do it:  https://t.co/27Y38un2tM
1288196778836205568 2020-07-28 12:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This election is not just about voting against Donald Trump. It’s about rising to this moment of crisis, understanding people’s struggle, and building a future worthy of their courage and ambition to overcome.
1288196275695792129 2020-07-28 12:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A change of “tone” over a few days does not change the facts of the last four years.  Donald Trump fails the basic threshold test of being president: the duty to care about the entire country, not just his re-election prospects.
1288195017522270208 2020-07-28 12:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Senate and this President should pass the bill to restore the Voting Rights Act — renamed yesterday in memory of John Lewis.  If they don’t, it will be one of the first things I do as president.
1288192572112793600 2020-07-28 12:20:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm in Wilmington, Delaware, to unveil the fourth plank of my Build Back Better plan. Tune in as I discuss what my administration will do to advance racial equity in our economy:  https://t.co/NTZviQqUX5
1288176142797611008 2020-07-28 11:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In this moment, we have the chance to build an economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead. One more vibrant and more powerful because everyone is in on the deal.  Here's how we'll do it:  https://t.co/27Y38un2tM  https://t.co/d0kM3yyglS
1288150977116286977 2020-07-28 09:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can't build this nation back better without tackling the systemic racism and disparities that have plagued our country for far too long. That's why today, I'm releasing my new plan to advance racial economic equity across the American economy.  https://t.co/MQW8ItM0J8
1288120526683029512 2020-07-28 07:34:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our students and educators deserve better than four more years of Betsy DeVos. It’s time for a Secretary of Education who is actually a public school educator.  https://t.co/rUVThAQ24K
1287915678540808192 2020-07-27 18:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> John — march on, dear friend. May God bless you. And may you continue to inspire righteous good trouble down from the Heavens.  https://t.co/lqg9SGxYNE
1287908127476551680 2020-07-27 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight, Jill and I are thinking about the 150,000 families left emptier by this virus.  To anyone who’s struggling, sick, or wondering how they’ll get through the day: know that I will not abandon you.   We’ll fight through this crisis together, and emerge stronger than ever.
1287901583758352385 2020-07-27 17:04:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Arianna’s a supporter of our campaign who’s been organizing food drives for her community during the COVID crisis. My team told me about her work, so @BarackObama and I decided to surprise her with a call.  https://t.co/GnwvU6HMld
1287867861436776449 2020-07-27 14:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The development of a new vaccine requires a dedication to science, coordination, transparency, truth, and fairness to all — and we have a President who stands for none of these things.  https://t.co/38t303Fknw
1287863331626389508 2020-07-27 14:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> These policies aren’t just the right thing to do — they’re also the smart thing to do for the future of our country.  https://t.co/zoXsJ2PbXG
1287827595963375620 2020-07-27 12:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Women-owned small businesses like Marsh + Mane are the backbone of communities across the nation. We have got to do more to invest in and support them.  Here's what I'll do as president:  https://t.co/EUs7NyzOEe  https://t.co/bhRSHXQVGs
1287788085888065540 2020-07-27 09:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The hard truth is women — and particularly women of color — have never had a fair shot to get ahead in this country. That's why today, I'm releasing my plan to make sure women can fully participate in our economy and country.  https://t.co/vUWUanQAR0
1287764429703188482 2020-07-27 07:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The hard truth is this pandemic didn’t have to be this bad. Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, breaks down what a Biden administration would have done differently and what we would do now to get this virus under control:  https://t.co/cw8mBOfujj
1287528122804514817 2020-07-26 16:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In 100 days, we’re going to make Donald Trump a one-term president.  https://t.co/vTrPRrHhwm
1287484334178525192 2020-07-26 13:26:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Women have decided the course of history with grit, clarity, and courage. This election is no different.  We have just 100 days to get out the vote, unite the country, and vote Donald Trump out of the White House.  Join us, and let's get to work:  https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW  https://t.co/9CnwM9wEDM
1287474016152948736 2020-07-26 12:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thirty years on, we still have work to do to realize the full aspiration of the Americans with Disabilities Act. We need to ensure that every American has the chance to live independently and free from discriminatory systems and practices. #ADA30  https://t.co/BIMyE5Hy3h
1287443817214488578 2020-07-26 10:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, we have just 100 days until Election Day. Now, more than ever, we have to do everything we can to make Donald Trump a one-term president.  Register to vote:  https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M  Donate:  https://t.co/Iimssjnz4A  Volunteer:  https://t.co/GCxsKwFY4h  Let’s get to work.  https://t.co/aa1BsTsdu9
1287409844593418240 2020-07-26 08:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In 100 days, we have the chance to set our nation on a new path. One where we finally live up to our highest ideals and everyone has a fair shot at success.  Join us:  https://t.co/gnaFCAUzju  https://t.co/fkmLEpLvJR
1287372098361409537 2020-07-26 06:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> 100 days.
1287187125759352833 2020-07-25 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As Hurricane Hanna makes landfall, Jill and I are sending our prayers to the people of South Texas. We must ensure that affected residents get the support they need — and get it quickly. If you are in an impacted region, please heed the advice of local officials and seek shelter.
1287168252108574721 2020-07-25 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know firsthand how hard it can be to take care of an aging family member. It's why as president, I'll ease the financial burden on families and expand access to dignified care for older Americans.  https://t.co/Z8FOorRgLe
1287130506295836672 2020-07-25 14:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> No one should have to work more than one job to make ends meet. We have to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and build an inclusive middle class that brings everyone along.
1287100304429735936 2020-07-25 12:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There is no quit in America — and you deserve a president who won’t quit on you.
1287070108465139713 2020-07-25 10:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump ordered his administration to slow down coronavirus testing, he tried to block CDC funding, and he has ignored the experts from day one. His actions defy both logic and humanity.   What kind of president actively undercuts efforts that will save lives?
1287032859597864960 2020-07-25 07:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every American family deserves access to affordable, high-quality child care.  Here's how I'll make that happen:  https://t.co/Z8FOorRgLe  https://t.co/4woudaAGqo
1286817188288970758 2020-07-24 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know times are tough, but I want you to know you're not alone. We're all in this fight together. And together, we'll emerge stronger than before.
1286788247511736320 2020-07-24 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The President has a duty to care for us all. To see people where they are and to understand what they’re going through.  I’ve been a single parent. Even though I had a lot more support than a lot of folks going through tough times, I know how hard it is.  https://t.co/7JlGjvUcqd
1286763081905971201 2020-07-24 13:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is the United States of America. We don’t settle — we aspire.  Let’s get to work.
1286730367664349198 2020-07-24 11:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The hard truth is that we can't just build back to the way things were before these crises — we have to build back better.  President @BarackObama and I discussed how we can do that, and much more:  https://t.co/DBqIS5IoN3
1286704193756114945 2020-07-24 09:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our nation is at a crossroads. We can choose four more years of Donald Trump’s divisive politics and failed leadership — or we can forge a new path forward.  https://t.co/CHbtVP8IaV
1286670471623254018 2020-07-24 07:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Home care workers and child care workers — who are more often women, women of color, and immigrants — have been underpaid, unseen, and undervalued for far too long.  That will change with my administration:  https://t.co/RbUFxJ3CYS
1286458575150370817 2020-07-23 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump’s own staff admits that he fails the most important test of being the American President: the duty to care — for you, for all of us.  https://t.co/mJf0xhEYZ5
1286439700958453763 2020-07-23 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who listens to someone other than himself.
1286423343135182848 2020-07-23 15:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This was preventable.
1286415793245347845 2020-07-23 14:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Out of every trial and tribulation, we've always emerged stronger as a nation — and we will again. If we come together, there is not a single thing we cannot accomplish.  https://t.co/khTCfexgbX
1286391885993373696 2020-07-23 13:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hey @Phillies, here’s to hoping we both win big this fall. Stay safe. #OpeningDay  https://t.co/nGtdDVsrXv
1286370998216986624 2020-07-23 11:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> COVID-19 infections are going up.  The number of deaths is going up.   This morning it was announced that, once again, the number of unemployment claims is going up.   Donald Trump is moving us backwards. The American people are paying the price.
1286348097291816960 2020-07-23 10:11:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Care jobs are ready to be filled right now, allowing millions of people — primarily women — to get back to work immediately.  It's the right thing to do for our families and our essential workers — and it's the smart thing to do for our economy.  https://t.co/l598dnBp0O
1286300138239979527 2020-07-23 07:00:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, I sat down with my friend President @BarackObama to discuss the significant moment we're in, who we are as a nation, and how we can build back better.   Watch our full conversation:  https://t.co/n2P71Le1oH
1286254983961165826 2020-07-23 04:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day I hear from folks who tell me how important health care is to their families — well, it's deeply personal for President @BarackObama and me, too. I'll fight to protect and build on Obamacare and make sure everyone gets the care they need.  Watch our conversation:  https://t.co/ZyrBmLrjCJ
1286089896310931457 2020-07-22 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be clear: If vote-by-mail is good enough for Donald Trump and his administration, then it's good enough for all of us.  https://t.co/0qQW9ff0eG
1286072279764537349 2020-07-22 15:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know everything feels different right now. There’s just that feeling where you don’t know if everything will be okay. But I promise you that it can be and it will be.  https://t.co/rax3jyH8hq
1286048372198014976 2020-07-22 14:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, the House passed the #NoBanAct because no one should be discriminated against or singled out based on the faith they practice. I will end President Trump's Muslim Ban on day one and sign this bill into law.
1286042584083607552 2020-07-22 13:57:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My plan to create a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce will put 3 million Americans to work — and free up millions more people to join the paid labor force.  It's a fresh, bold approach that will help us recover faster and stronger.  https://t.co/nxpwi93TEp
1286027988065124352 2020-07-22 12:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The goal of the Census is clear: count every person. But Donald Trump continues to use this vital process to sow division and scare immigrant communities.  We won't let him deny communities the funding and representation they deserve. Because in America, everyone counts.
1286003073786281985 2020-07-22 11:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The words of a president matter. And from the moment President Trump came down that escalator, he has used his to degrade people and sow division. It's not who we are.  Watch my full conversation with President @BarackObama tomorrow at 10 AM ET.  https://t.co/hFRbz1kfcc
1285957020466720768 2020-07-22 08:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, we're facing a serious threat — and we have to meet it together as one country. It's up to all of us to do everything we can to keep our fellow Americans safe and healthy.  https://t.co/97Td2QvmAG
1285899895422046209 2020-07-22 04:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 44 + 46 7.23.20  https://t.co/ZCQ2SazieH
1285776581554614272 2020-07-21 20:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 10 years ago the Obama-Biden Administration signed Wall Street reform to prevent the abuse that led to the Great Recession. Donald Trump and the Republicans have tried to tear it down ever since. As president, I'll protect it so we can rebuild an economy that works for everyone.
1285729269646274561 2020-07-21 17:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> For your family, for your neighbors, for your country — wear a mask.
1285700580669820930 2020-07-21 15:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Happy Birthday, Congressman Clyburn! Your powerful voice of moral clarity never fails to steer us toward a better future — and reminds us all of why we're in public service in the first place. I’m grateful for your leadership and honored to call you a friend.  https://t.co/Rtv34FpQAI
1285675414732431360 2020-07-21 13:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me say what President Trump won't: Russian interference in our elections is a violation of our sovereignty. And if I’m president, I’ll respond accordingly.  https://t.co/ZvkU7bbJ3r
1285640937725542400 2020-07-21 11:21:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Home health workers do God’s work, but aren’t paid much. They have few benefits, and 40% are still on SNAP or Medicaid. It's unacceptable.  I'll give caregivers and early childhood educators a much-needed raise.
1285640182700453888 2020-07-21 11:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need to make high-quality child care affordable and accessible. As president, I'll give every 3- and 4-year-old access to free, high-quality preschool. And low- to middle-income families won’t spend more than 7% of their income on quality care for children under age 5.
1285639176017215488 2020-07-21 11:14:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are trapped in a caregiving crisis, within an economic crisis, within a public health crisis. You’re doing everything you can, but this president is not.  If I’m your president, here’s what I would do:  https://t.co/RbUFxJldQq
1285638169443041280 2020-07-21 11:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump simply doesn’t understand: We can’t deal with our economic crisis without solving the public health crisis.   And for all his bluster about his expertise on the economy, he is unable to explain how he will actually help the working families hit the hardest.
1285636224032505856 2020-07-21 11:02:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to mobilize a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation. Today, I'm delivering remarks about how we're going to get it done. Tune in:  https://t.co/KyRgLogUaw
1285615520461422593 2020-07-21 09:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, I’m releasing my plan to mobilize a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce.  It will ease the financial burden of care for families, create good-paying jobs with good benefits, and treat workers with the dignity they deserve.   https://t.co/Z8FOorzFmE  https://t.co/hcyLR8CIbq
1285382736341942274 2020-07-20 18:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In honor of John Lewis, C.T. Vivian, and all the essential workers who have selflessly risked their lives, the Senate should pass a bill that ensures working people get real relief — extended unemployment insurance, rental support, and guaranteed sick leave. #StrikeForBlackLives
1285368895155474432 2020-07-20 17:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, it may be hard to believe, but we have just over 100 days until Election Day. I know we can beat Donald Trump and build this nation back better than before — but we need your help to do it.  If you're able, please chip in today:  https://t.co/3vHMq4Pxjc
1285350020942901255 2020-07-20 16:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Small manufacturers like McGregor Industries demonstrate the resilience, creativity, and staying-power of America’s industrial base.  Together we're going to make sure the future is made in America — by all of America.  https://t.co/LKqAzOgnw0
1285332404647784449 2020-07-20 14:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, I am putting the Kremlin and other foreign governments on notice: If elected president, I will direct my administration to impose substantial and lasting costs on those who interfere with American elections.  https://t.co/s9rEY92TQK
1285321080039669763 2020-07-20 14:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're paying the price for this president's incompetence every single day.
1285292642859773952 2020-07-20 12:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump asked to see the COVID death chart. @RealDonaldTrump, here you go.  https://t.co/45tYD2NXti
1285277040153776128 2020-07-20 11:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day it becomes clearer: We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are. What we believe. Who we want to be. It’s all at stake.  We have to vote Donald Trump out this November.
1285227969930072066 2020-07-20 08:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Imagine the future we can create with Donald Trump out of the White House. A future where we:  - Tackle the climate crisis - Build a new American economy - End our gun violence epidemic - Ensure our government works for all, not just the wealthy few
1285005248768217089 2020-07-19 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In this moment of crisis, we have the chance to build a new American economy. One where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead.  Together, we'll get it done.
1284978824749309952 2020-07-19 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day is National Ice Cream Day in my book.  https://t.co/R6WR0LNspS
1284933527088365569 2020-07-19 12:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mr. President, your ignorance isn’t a virtue or a sign of your strength — it’s undercutting our response to this unprecedented crisis at every turn and it’s costing Americans their jobs and their lives.  https://t.co/PXSNiGNa6w
1284912638577655808 2020-07-19 11:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The hard truth is that it didn’t have to be this bad, but Donald Trump ignored the experts and refused to take action. He has failed our nation.  https://t.co/WAhigUtsxz
1284883446251294722 2020-07-19 09:11:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose hope over fear.
1284862558910865408 2020-07-19 07:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Banning the Confederate flag from military installations was long overdue.   Banning the LGBTQ Pride flag — the very symbol of diversity and inclusion — is undeniably wrong. The Pentagon should ensure it is authorized, or as President, I will.    https://t.co/rvA4F2YcPS
1284502687430479874 2020-07-18 07:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know of no man with more courage than John Lewis. He was a giant walking among us. When I saw him, I couldn’t help but think one thing: “I haven’t done enough.” May his life and legacy inspire every one of us to strive for justice, equality and what is right.  https://t.co/jtoCnmjexz
1284492110503317504 2020-07-18 07:15:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> My full statement:  https://t.co/TVZsGzalO4
1284492109496619009 2020-07-18 07:15:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are made in the image of God, and then there is John Lewis. He was truly one-of-a-kind, a moral compass who always knew where to point us and which direction to march. To John’s family, friends, staff, and constituents, Jill and I send you our love and prayers.
1284276699337646080 2020-07-17 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As President, I will see to it that America once again stands for human rights. That doesn't mean rights only for some, but rights for all — each and every American, and every person, everywhere. No exceptions.  https://t.co/fxULEFsp3O
1284259082254217216 2020-07-17 15:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, we lost a giant of the civil rights movement and a relentless champion in the struggle for justice. Reverend C.T. Vivian never stopped pushing our nation closer to our highest ideals — and we are better because of it. Jill and I are keeping his loved ones in our prayers.
1284243982747414529 2020-07-17 14:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Eleven. That's how many times we've broken the single-day record for new COVID-19 cases in the last month.  This virus isn't going to "just disappear" like President Trump wants. It's surging — and we need real leadership from this White House to slow its spread.
1284211267108868097 2020-07-17 12:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve released 21 years of my tax returns — why hasn’t Donald Trump?  We deserve to know what this president is hiding.
1284190127896629248 2020-07-17 11:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Everyone wants our schools to reopen. The question is how to make it safe and how to make it stick. Forcing educators and students back into classrooms in areas where infection rates are going up or remaining too high is just plain dangerous.  https://t.co/8OeTj2eWdt
1284174776861372417 2020-07-17 10:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to make the places we live, work, and learn healthier and more energy-efficient. That's why my administration will upgrade 4 million buildings and weatherize 2 million homes across the country — creating over one million jobs in the process.  https://t.co/JpXThuFg2d
1284142816197836807 2020-07-17 08:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No matter who you supported in 2016, I want you to know that you have a home in our campaign. You’re not just wanted — you’re needed.  Together, we're going to beat Donald Trump and build this nation back better than it was before.  https://t.co/z7Vk9mRrgI
1283934443057577984 2020-07-16 18:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have the power to write the future we want for our country. Don't let anyone tell you differently.
1283918085288652800 2020-07-16 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Obama and I left a playbook for President Trump on how to fight pandemics. He flat-out ignored it. And we're all paying the price every day.
1283906760865005569 2020-07-16 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> From day one, Donald Trump has been focused on the stock market and delivering for his wealthy friends and big corporations.  As president, I will be laser-focused on working families and small businesses.  https://t.co/3gFMqw4nk6
1283871025197748224 2020-07-16 14:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let's call this what it is: A modern-day poll tax. It's unconscionable.  We need to restore voting rights for individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies — and ensure everyone can make their voice heard at the ballot box.
1283856429129125894 2020-07-16 13:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are months into this crisis, and our health care workers are still being forced to reuse masks. It’s unacceptable.  Mr. President, fix the PPE shortages before you tee off for yet another round of golf.
1283817925368053760 2020-07-16 10:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through a public health crisis.  https://t.co/6s6KCGU9KV
1283795779338084352 2020-07-16 09:09:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I don’t have Bitcoin, and I’ll never ask you to send me any.  But if you want to chip in to help make Donald Trump a one-term President, you can do that here:  https://t.co/8XtBjuU5fX
1283506626348167178 2020-07-15 14:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Meeting the threat of climate change presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to jolt new life into our economy. We're going to create millions of high-quality, union jobs by building a modern infrastructure and a clean energy future.  https://t.co/zzLLfkPcot
1283492028177940485 2020-07-15 13:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There is no time to waste when it comes to addressing the existential threat of climate change. If I have the honor of being elected president, we'll get to work delivering results on day one.  https://t.co/YLuhSkl7ux
1283473908591714311 2020-07-15 11:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump needs to do everything in his power to surge nationwide testing — including developing and evaluating more accurate, affordable, accessible, faster tests so we can reopen safely.  Infection rates are rising at an alarming pace. Mr. President, act now.
1283446227074310144 2020-07-15 10:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mr. President, “Open everything now,” isn’t a strategy for success. It’s barely a slogan.   It’s long past time for you to step up and do your job.
1283412252612194304 2020-07-15 07:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This pandemic has gotten bad enough that even Donald Trump finally decided to wear a mask in public.  I’m glad he made that shift — but it’s not enough.  We need real presidential leadership. Right now.  https://t.co/Gy4U1RrlYT
1283199601001009159 2020-07-14 17:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're facing an economic crisis and a climate crisis.    As president, I'll create millions of jobs building resilient roads and bridges, manufacturing electric vehicles, and weatherizing homes and buildings.   Learn more:  https://t.co/VS3yoJmSzQ  https://t.co/IZIfHPTCjU
1283186263302918144 2020-07-14 16:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When I hear the words climate change, I hear the word "jobs." Good paying, union jobs that will solve our jobs crisis while addressing our climate crisis.  https://t.co/7NRGNXsMI6
1283168143867707392 2020-07-14 15:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Climate change is the challenge that's going to define our American future. And if I have the honor of being elected President, we won't tinker around the edges, we’ll seize this opportunity and meet this moment in history.
1283106488328900615 2020-07-14 11:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, all he can muster is one word: “hoax.”   When I think about climate change, I think of a word as well: “jobs.”   Good-paying, union jobs that put Americans to work.  https://t.co/AKl9jZKB0s
1283105229156696064 2020-07-14 11:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every few weeks when he needs a distraction from the latest charge of corruption in his staff — or the conviction of high ranking members of his administration — Donald Trump announces it’s “Infrastructure Week.”  He's never delivered. I know how to get it done.
1283099425275961344 2020-07-14 11:01:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t just build things back to the way they were — we’ve got to build America back better. Tune in as I deliver remarks on how we're going to invest in infrastructure and clean energy and create millions of jobs in the process:  https://t.co/c3kocZapIH
1283034009895751680 2020-07-14 06:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I want every single American to know: If you're sick, struggling, or worried about how you're going to get through the day, I will not abandon you.  We're all in this together. And together, we'll emerge stronger than before.  https://t.co/NUg03vokKp
1282846021169508352 2020-07-13 18:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We shouldn't have to beg this president to listen to the experts.
1282813568535203840 2020-07-13 16:06:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> The hard truth is it didn't have to be this bad. But Donald Trump has squandered every chance he's had to contain the spread of this virus.
1282773040187805700 2020-07-13 13:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America can’t sit on the sidelines in the race for the future. My administration will invest $300 billion in research and development over four years to secure our global leadership and create millions of good-paying jobs.  https://t.co/xx2oLJ8VEt
1282755424177893376 2020-07-13 12:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> "We're leading the world."  https://t.co/QQzaQeKAUj
1282713901671604224 2020-07-13 09:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump needs to spend less time playing golf and more time listening to experts like Dr. Fauci.
1282683703190188032 2020-07-13 07:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In January, I sounded the alarm regarding COVID-19.   Over five months later, President Trump still hasn't taken the action needed to respond to the virus. It's unacceptable.  This president has failed the American people every step of the way.  https://t.co/PH4vF5KLuI
1282484891603447808 2020-07-12 18:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The stakes couldn't be higher this November. Time and time again, Donald Trump has failed the people of Puerto Rico.  As President, I'll spur economic development on the island and expand access to health care.
1282468533838860288 2020-07-12 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Together, we're going to build a new American economy:  https://t.co/RvfzbDN7dP  https://t.co/5TePAe7tbY
1282446656303243264 2020-07-12 15:48:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, I'll actually listen to the experts and heed their advice. Not silence them.
1282419453939113989 2020-07-12 13:59:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mohamed Amashah is finally home after 486 days in Egyptian prison for holding a protest sign. Arresting, torturing, and exiling activists like Sarah Hegazy and Mohamed Soltan or threatening their families is unacceptable. No more blank checks for Trump’s "favorite dictator."
1282409432677257216 2020-07-12 13:20:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ignore the polls.  We’ve got work to do:  https://t.co/GCxsKwFY4h
1282385989852295168 2020-07-12 11:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Health care is personal to me. And as president, I'll do everything I can to make sure every American has access to the care they need.  https://t.co/Rmwsmx54KW
1282366864052518912 2020-07-12 10:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who will always choose to unite rather than divide, because there’s nothing we can’t accomplish when we do it together.
1282326347201863680 2020-07-12 07:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To all the nurses on the frontlines of this fight, thank you. You are American heroes.  https://t.co/fgTDhXU72C
1282109920712642561 2020-07-11 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this moment.  We need real leadership, right now. Lives are at stake.
1282079721875021826 2020-07-11 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Back in January, when President Trump signed his hollow "phase one" trade deal with Beijing, I made clear that no one should be fooled by Trump's empty promises to deliver a meaningful “phase two" deal.  Good to see that he's finally admitting I was right.  https://t.co/Us8t3Z0KfA
1282053668280434689 2020-07-11 13:46:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history. Every day that he remains in office, he further threatens the future of our democracy.  We have to vote him out this November.
1282043734742507520 2020-07-11 13:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I have no illusion about how tough the road ahead is. But I’m optimistic for one reason above all others: I know the history and the heart of this country.  Given a chance, ordinary Americans can do extraordinary things.  https://t.co/448jA7xlY3
1282004979457433601 2020-07-11 10:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This was almost two months ago.   Since then? Tens of thousands more lives lost. A million and a half new cases.  The President? Still golfing.  https://t.co/rHvIX80tLA
1281996678980005889 2020-07-11 10:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> The United States has over 3 million cases of COVID-19, and over 130,000 people have died — yet Donald Trump continues to say it will just "fade away." It’s unbelievable.  We're paying the price for this president's incompetence every single day.
1281961442460291074 2020-07-11 07:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I see a different America than President Trump. One that, despite all our flaws and shortcomings and failings, is still after more than two centuries dedicated to equality, liberty, human dignity, and justice.  I know we can reach our highest ideals — together.
1281779986693787653 2020-07-10 19:38:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> Still true.
1281726645376819202 2020-07-10 16:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Determination. Resilience. Grit. The strength to get up no matter how many times you’ve been knocked down. Respect for hard work, and for the people who do it.   Those are the values I learned growing up in Scranton — and they're the values I’ll take to the Oval Office.
1281693174696759298 2020-07-10 13:54:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is what “America First” looks like under President Trump:  https://t.co/jSmJOeG13G
1281667505790967808 2020-07-10 12:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Through every trial and tribulation, we've always emerged stronger — and we will again.
1281635545408393217 2020-07-10 10:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s use this opportunity to make bold investments in American industry and innovation so the future is made in America — and in all of America.   https://t.co/uTI6Gydi1n  https://t.co/8F8Uj2a3BI
1281602829443112966 2020-07-10 07:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here's my promise to you: If I have the honor of being elected president, I will take care of your family like I would my own.  https://t.co/vYmVUdMLO7
1281384390019489792 2020-07-09 17:27:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The American people deserve to know what Donald Trump is hiding in his tax returns.
1281368032405671936 2020-07-09 16:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can't just build back to the way things were before these crises — we have to build back better.
1281349912848809984 2020-07-09 15:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is our moment to imagine and build a new American economy — one where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead.  https://t.co/BPUISe4Fd6
1281331038476619776 2020-07-09 13:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I do not buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past.   American manufacturing was the Arsenal of Democracy in World War II, and must be part of the engine of American prosperity now.
1281326005609615360 2020-07-09 13:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can't just focus on the jobs of today — we have to also focus on the jobs and industries of tomorrow. I'll make a historic $300 billion investment in research and development that will spur innovation and help create 3 million jobs across the nation.  https://t.co/o29BPuYSlb
1281324747461197825 2020-07-09 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> American workers can out-compete anyone, but they need a government that fights for them. I'll revitalize American manufacturing — especially smaller manufacturers and those owned by women and people of color — and ensure the future is made here in America.  https://t.co/lJQBsnRN75
1281323488846860288 2020-07-09 13:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy American products &amp; support American jobs.  But under Trump, the rate of federal contractors offshoring jobs more than doubled. It's unacceptable.  I'll invest $400 billion in American-made products &amp; keep jobs here at home.  https://t.co/iNpPuMzFqC
1281302797535727617 2020-07-09 12:02:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, to discuss my plan to create jobs, raise wages, and help America build back better. Tune in to watch:  https://t.co/fSHMWax1u6
1281253024808271878 2020-07-09 08:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're in the middle of an economic crisis. But it's not enough to just turn things around — we have to build back better. We have to revitalize American manufacturing and make sure the future is made in America — by all of America.  Here's how we'll do it:  https://t.co/lPgZPDPC98  https://t.co/ZjJ3pKiLrK
1281245474909913088 2020-07-09 08:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The future must be made in America — by all of America. Here's how we'll do it:  https://t.co/lPgZPE7d0G  https://t.co/KERhYFcXAY
1281232505362952193 2020-07-09 07:23:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> As I was saying.
1281021498933690368 2020-07-08 17:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Four years of Betsy DeVos is more than enough. We need a Secretary of Education who is actually a public school educator.
1281005917224435722 2020-07-08 16:23:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> I commend the Task Forces for their service and for helping build a bold, transformative platform for our party and for our country. And I am deeply grateful to @BernieSanders for working with us to unite our party and deliver real, lasting change for generations to come.
1280998849730039810 2020-07-08 15:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Increased testing isn’t the reason for the surge in coronavirus cases — Donald Trump's failed leadership is.  https://t.co/j7vKxnlaj4
1280974438993997829 2020-07-08 14:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump launched his 2016 campaign by calling Mexicans rapists.  He's spread racism against our Latino community ever since.  We need to work in partnership with Mexico.  We need to restore dignity and humanity to our immigration system.  That's what I'll do as President.
1280950782909538304 2020-07-08 12:44:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be clear: No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a pandemic because they can’t pay rent.  https://t.co/0NJ9ao7HON
1280923603744296962 2020-07-08 10:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When there were 15 cases, the President said it wouldn't spread any farther.   We just hit our 3 millionth case.  We're paying for his failure.  https://t.co/gYwTWZyYOs
1280887625147191296 2020-07-08 08:33:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@AdyBarkan — The courage you show every day is an inspiration to so many, and I'm grateful to have you by my side in this fight. We may not agree on everything, but this we do: Health care is a right — not a privilege. And we're going to make that a reality, together.
1280667921916854273 2020-07-07 18:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is a national disgrace. We have to ensure these communities get the care they need immediately — and then tackle racial disparities in health care and our economy head-on.
1280651561518002177 2020-07-07 16:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The most sacred obligation of our government is to keep our troops safe when we send them into battle — and to care for them when they come home. We need a president who will honor that obligation.  https://t.co/UMrDVwHaD3
1280620310539231237 2020-07-07 14:50:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> Across the world, people come to this country with unrelenting optimism and determination toward the future. They study here, innovate here, they make America who we are. Donald Trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does.
1280603719831359489 2020-07-07 13:44:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> Americans are safer when America is engaged in strengthening global health. On my first day as President, I will rejoin the @WHO and restore our leadership on the world stage.
1280584871841165312 2020-07-07 12:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We've seen what happens when the federal government fails to secure sufficient supplies of critical products like PPE — and we can't let it happen again. So today, I'm releasing my plan to rebuild U.S. supply chains:  https://t.co/5RXYqQcqmn
1280573547644141569 2020-07-07 11:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump needs to do his job.
1280552659565469697 2020-07-07 10:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Character belongs in the White House.  https://t.co/Bz1syMprhJ
1280525229106708483 2020-07-07 08:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To beat COVID-19, we need a coordinated national response from the federal government — but Donald Trump refuses to do his job. I've laid out exactly what I would do, and I encourage this president to adopt the plan in its entirety:  https://t.co/SOVOPL7uPy
1280305532843298816 2020-07-06 18:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There’s enormous opportunity once we defeat Donald Trump. We are going to build our health care system, our economy, and our country back better than they've ever been before.
1280279610505084928 2020-07-06 16:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The nation is crying out for leadership — leadership that can unite us and bring us together. But this president has nothing to offer.  https://t.co/rzV0GdOqHN
1280235066975797251 2020-07-06 13:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> With COVID-19 surging across the nation, Donald Trump should be doing everything in his power to increase access to testing. Instead, he's doing the opposite. It's despicable.
1280193543357648896 2020-07-06 10:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It didn't have to be this bad. But Donald Trump failed to do his job — and we're all paying the price.  https://t.co/OXONhAWNqy
1280158562891599873 2020-07-06 08:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump.  https://t.co/12yF31aLSz
1279928045093228545 2020-07-05 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're going to beat Donald Trump. And when we do, we won't just rebuild this nation — we'll transform it.
1279897844837683203 2020-07-05 15:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There are so many unsung heroes in our communities, especially in times of crisis. We owe Alassane and countless others a debt of gratitude — and I'll fight for them every day in the White House.  https://t.co/tUwZYpeoNW
1279885489554755594 2020-07-05 14:10:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> On this Venezuelan Independence Day, my thoughts are with Venezuelans who continue to work tirelessly for the cause of democracy. It’s time for free and fair elections so that the Venezuelan people can turn the page on the corrupt and repressive Maduro regime.
1279867648218664960 2020-07-05 13:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> COVID-19 is surging across the nation, and this president is doubling down on his efforts to rip health insurance and protections away from millions. It's heartless and cruel and must be stopped.
1279837447732396033 2020-07-05 11:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump wants to declare this health crisis over and unemployment solved so that he can get back to his campaign rallies. But he’s wrong — on both fronts.  We need a president who will actually do the work needed to get us through these crises.
1279807751426674688 2020-07-05 09:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The hard truth is that it didn’t have to be this bad, but Donald Trump ignored the warnings and refused to take action. He failed our nation.  https://t.co/AcY62E8L2L
1279789631853101058 2020-07-05 07:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve carried the middle class values that my parents instilled in me my entire life — and they’re the values I’ll bring to the White House.  https://t.co/WPIzFPD9Mv
1279565656120229889 2020-07-04 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Make no mistake, our best days still lie ahead. If we come together as one America, there’s not a single thing we cannot do.
1279535459924946947 2020-07-04 15:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The health care workers on the frontlines of this fight are some of the greatest heroes our nation has ever seen.  https://t.co/Ry6TvJcbuU
1279505259854008320 2020-07-04 13:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America was founded on the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all — and it's long past time we lived up to it.
1279475061796167681 2020-07-04 11:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> American history isn’t a fairytale. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push-and-pull for more than 240 years. But it’s a battle we can and will win — together.
1279444860957626370 2020-07-04 09:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This Fourth of July, one of the most patriotic things you can do is wear a mask.
1279414665542381568 2020-07-04 07:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our nation was founded on a simple idea: We're all created equal. We've never lived up to it — but we've never stopped trying. This Independence Day, let's not just celebrate those words, let's commit to finally fulfill them. Happy #FourthOfJuly!  https://t.co/1WrATlx8Xl
1279196860847095809 2020-07-03 16:34:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> “If you put the wrong person in office, you'll see things that you would not have believed are possible."  https://t.co/8gDSbOJbeS
1279191943747194881 2020-07-03 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It didn't have to be this bad. But month after month, as other leaders in other countries took the necessary steps to get the virus under control, Donald Trump failed us.  Here's what I'll do as president:  https://t.co/xsCrfzWnxC
1279154194709016576 2020-07-03 13:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s abundantly clear that this virus isn’t going to just “fade away,” Mr. President. It’s time for you to step up, take action, and lead.
1279131545521885184 2020-07-03 12:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose science over fiction.
1279113929717768193 2020-07-03 11:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump styled himself as a wartime president. But now it seems this president has surrendered. He has waved the white flag and left the field of battle when we need him most. It's unacceptable.  We need real leadership. Right now.  https://t.co/2T3WbFLYV3
1279071147875860481 2020-07-03 08:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are five months into this crisis, and our health care workers still don't have the masks and protective equipment they need. It's a national disgrace.  Mr. President, use your authority and fix the shortage of PPE before you tee off for yet another round of golf.
1278855980902572034 2020-07-02 18:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump has called himself a "cheerleader" for the nation. But we don't need a cheerleader — we need a President. One who will:  - Lead by example - Take responsibility - Tell the unvarnished truth - Listen to the experts and follow the science
1278833330729783297 2020-07-02 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Wear a mask.  https://t.co/HBDMNA4ary
1278809602763751424 2020-07-02 14:55:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be clear: There’s no victory to be celebrated when we’re still down nearly 15 million jobs and the pandemic is getting worse, not better.
1278776708351451136 2020-07-02 12:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is a job Donald Trump is entirely unfit for.  https://t.co/7vipLgLCiU
1278747263439794178 2020-07-02 10:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> “Mr. President, it's too much.”  https://t.co/WEebjiPKgj
1278733658019500032 2020-07-02 09:53:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is a shameful move. Now is the time for employers to have empathy for families juggling work and caregiving.  It's long past time for President Trump to show some leadership so we can get this virus under control.
1278717525497274368 2020-07-02 08:49:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tune in as I address the nation on the economic crisis and the latest jobs report:  https://t.co/SKrDmWptL4
1278498625069502465 2020-07-01 18:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mr. President, this pandemic isn't about you. It's about the health and well-being of the American people.  https://t.co/uxRijdtTmj
1278482267396993024 2020-07-01 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 125 days.  https://t.co/8XWNjhwJzL
1278467168250839040 2020-07-01 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ll read my daily briefings.
1278455843965612037 2020-07-01 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Small businesses are the backbone of communities across our nation, and we need to do so much more to help them. Donald Trump may have forgotten about them — but I never will.  https://t.co/RDYKzt1Qc1
1278438227163009025 2020-07-01 14:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If the reports are true, Donald Trump either read his briefings about the Russian bounties and did nothing — or he didn't read them at all. Either way, it's an unjustifiable dereliction of duty.  The American people deserve answers.  https://t.co/LuDqIUrjhP
1278415577875394562 2020-07-01 12:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On day one, I’ll get right to work tackling COVID-19. I'll bring together our nation's top experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.  We are all in this together — and we've got to fight this together.  https://t.co/7An2MOGiiF
1278371537654079488 2020-07-01 09:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a clear message from the very top of our federal government that everyone needs to wear a mask in public. Period.  It’s not just about you — it’s about your family, your neighbors, your colleagues. It’s about keeping other people safe.
1278333789060513792 2020-07-01 07:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is my promise to you: When I am President, I will take care of your health care coverage and your family the same way I would my own.  https://t.co/Ahq3vZHT5l
1278127429173870592 2020-06-30 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As #ImmigrantHeritageMonth comes to a close, I want to make one thing clear: Immigrants have always made our nation stronger — our diversity is, and has always been, our greatest strength.  Donald Trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does.
1278119879443460101 2020-06-30 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, we’re just a few hours away from our end-of-quarter deadline, and we need your help to hit our goal. Every donation — big or small — goes a long way to helping us catch up to Donald Trump.  If you can, please chip in today:  https://t.co/18tN9TNYtX
1278112329658281985 2020-06-30 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On the final day of #PrideMonth, here’s my promise to you: If I have the honor of being elected, I will be the most pro-equality president in our nation’s history. LGBTQ+ rights are human rights — and we can't rest until everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law.
1278094713543888897 2020-06-30 15:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re facing a serious threat — and we need to meet it together as one country. But this President gives us no direction and actively pits us against one another.  We can't continue on like this.  https://t.co/LA8OJ86Nnk
1278069548076331008 2020-06-30 13:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If I’m elected, I’ll immediately reach out to Dr. Fauci and ask him to continue his incredible service to our country.   I’ll have the nation’s top medical experts and scientists ready to advise our response on day one — and I'll actually listen to them.
1278046898536898560 2020-06-30 12:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mr. President, the American people didn’t make enormous sacrifices over the past four months so you could waste your time with late night rants and tweets.  Step up. Take responsibility. Do your job.
1278012801143865344 2020-06-30 10:09:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tune in as I deliver remarks on how President Trump failed to protect the American people, save our economy, and control the virus:  https://t.co/pqbJECpUHQ
1277985745609908225 2020-06-30 08:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I want every single American to know: if you’re sick, if you’re struggling, if you’re worried about how you’re going to get through the day — I will not abandon you. I will not leave you to face these challenges alone.  We are going to get through this — together.
1277761266757431299 2020-06-29 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As simple as it sounds, we need a president who listens. So much of this could have been prevented if Donald Trump listened to someone other than himself.
1277743650412408839 2020-06-29 16:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, tomorrow night marks our first end-of-quarter deadline of the general election. We need your help to hit our goal so we can catch up to Donald Trump's hefty cash-on-hand advantage.   I know times are tough, but if you're able, please chip in today:  https://t.co/mv8ZZdhwAI
1277715968614035457 2020-06-29 14:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The President spent his weekend golfing.  https://t.co/zQepsL9lUp
1277703163429208068 2020-06-29 13:39:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here’s my promise to you: I’ll appoint a director who will actually go after financial predators and protect consumers.
1277695835413925888 2020-06-29 13:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today's decision reaffirmed that states can't put in place laws that unduly burden a woman's right to make her own health care decisions—but the fight isn't over. As President, I'll codify Roe v. Wade and protect a woman’s constitutional right to choose.   https://t.co/qFrH8hFst8
1277658086556209155 2020-06-29 10:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's time we remember who we are as Americans: we treat each other with dignity and respect, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor.  We are everything that Donald Trump is not.
1277637790965129216 2020-06-29 09:19:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> William Perry Pendley spent his career fighting to sell off public lands — and to allow drilling, mining, and logging on them with hardly any oversight.   Now the President has nominated him to oversee them at @BLMNational. Consider me opposed.
1277398878526963712 2020-06-28 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> White supremacy should be rooted out and relegated to the pages of history — not promoted by the President of the United States.
1277388390518964225 2020-06-28 16:48:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> The arc of the moral universe bent a little bit more today.
1277368680276344832 2020-06-28 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Obamacare was and is a big deal. We can't let Donald Trump tear it down — we have to protect and build on it.  https://t.co/P9QZvidZmD
1277346032427425799 2020-06-28 14:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 51 years ago today, a movement was born on Christopher Street. As we remember the anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising and the brave individuals who changed our world forever, let's recommit to finishing the job and finally achieving full LGBTQ+ equality. #Pride  https://t.co/PzbGOMy0zx
1277318851160506369 2020-06-28 12:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump's entire presidency has been a gift to Putin, but this is beyond the pale. It’s a betrayal of the most sacred duty we bear as a nation, to protect and equip our troops when we send them into harm’s way.  https://t.co/r6DCWowxc4
1277295195348807680 2020-06-28 10:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today the President shared a video of people shouting “white power” and said they were “great.” Just like he did after Charlottesville.   We’re in a battle for the soul of the nation — and the President has picked a side. But make no mistake: it’s a battle we will win.
1277024411091075072 2020-06-27 16:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Children should be released from ICE detention with their parents immediately. This is pretty simple, and I can't believe I have to say it: Families belong together.  https://t.co/11F5X71AO1
1277001258558042113 2020-06-27 15:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Now, let's push our progress further.   https://t.co/gm6jgUrcaT  https://t.co/06VQXBIkTu
1276971562843795457 2020-06-27 13:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he proves just how unfit he is to lead our nation.
1276930290858905605 2020-06-27 10:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Wear a mask.  https://t.co/lejMbH1jjC
1276896820547985409 2020-06-27 08:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If Donald Trump prevails in the U.S. Supreme Court, insurers could strip away your health insurance coverage or jack up premiums — simply because you experience long-term effects after battling the coronavirus.  We can't let that happen.  https://t.co/cpgHP1FQuS
1276683990594879493 2020-06-26 18:09:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> Equal representation and participation matter. #DCStatehood
1276666804782407680 2020-06-26 17:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know these times are dark, but I firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. If we come together as one America, there's nothing that we can't accomplish.
1276645916988993537 2020-06-26 15:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the few. We have to ensure every single American has access to the care they need and deserve.  Here’s what I would do as president:  https://t.co/gm6jgUrcaT  https://t.co/4zuTzH6zt9
1276609021026459650 2020-06-26 13:11:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congratulations, Alexis. We need you in this fight. Proud to stand with you and Planned Parenthood Action Fund.
1276589797398765574 2020-06-26 11:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Progress is possible.  https://t.co/wvw97zNd9j
1276569916427120640 2020-06-26 10:36:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is acting like a child who just can’t believe this pandemic has happened to him.  https://t.co/06xilwAmlV
1276539465830449154 2020-06-26 08:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Last week, President Trump claimed the virus would "fade away."  Now, we're facing a record-high number of new cases, and it's surging across the country.  Trump refuses to listen to the experts and take action — and we're all paying the price.
1276331847987990529 2020-06-25 18:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In this moment, we have an enormous opportunity to root out systemic racism and close the racial wealth and income gaps. We can do it, together.  https://t.co/l6AmXzfDDB
1276296615377145856 2020-06-25 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through a global pandemic.
1276285377595281408 2020-06-25 15:45:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> DC should be a state. Pass it on.
1276271018143879168 2020-06-25 14:48:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> The American people have sacrificed so much to fight this virus — we've lost lives, businesses, paychecks. And now, we're losing the progress we've made because this president refuses to do his job.  Donald Trump has failed our nation every step of the way.
1276252130731610112 2020-06-25 13:33:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> While President Trump continues his victory lap, over 20 million Americans remain out of work. He may have forgotten about you, but I never will — and I'll fight for you every single day in the White House.
1276225221486243840 2020-06-25 11:46:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> While the Trump Administration continues their efforts to rip health care away from millions, I'm speaking about how we can make quality, affordable health care available to every American.  Tune in:  https://t.co/CJ8KWt4Z2M
1276218601528229888 2020-06-25 11:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Health care workers are selflessly risking their lives every day on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 — and hundreds have paid the ultimate price.  They are American heroes — and we cannot forget the sacrifices they made to care for us all.  https://t.co/JBlSo0mYdb
1276197965451780096 2020-06-25 09:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Democracy is under threat globally. Restoring the soul of America means fixing democracy at home, and confronting — not cozying up to — dictators around the world. When I'm president, America will defend democracy at home and abroad.  https://t.co/3L6gqvXgI7
1276172044925722625 2020-06-25 08:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the few.
1275941587596595200 2020-06-24 16:59:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> This virus is not just going to disappear because you want it to, Mr. President.  Listen to the experts. Take clear, concrete action. Do your job.
1275919129292095488 2020-06-24 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight, @DrBiden and I will be hosting "A Community of Pride" to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the world's first Pride march. Join us, @theebillyporter, @jvn, @catcora, and @K_JeanPierre at 7:30 PM ET:  https://t.co/cFrDy8CbhY  https://t.co/J3uKJ3Q6EF
1275903127808618504 2020-06-24 14:26:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> I am proud to have the @NRDC_AF, under the exceptional leadership of my friend Gina McCarthy, by my side. Together, we'll lead the world in a clean energy revolution that will help us reduce our carbon emissions and create good-paying union jobs.
1275876391389728768 2020-06-24 12:40:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ignore the polls.   Register to vote:  https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M
1275842575803527169 2020-06-24 10:25:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> Brian — the courage and strength you've shown in the face of daunting odds is an inspiration to us all. I'm confident that with folks like you leading the way and with the power of our best minds, we'll find treatments and cures and beat this thing once and for all.
1275812425120444416 2020-06-24 08:26:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Workers called back on the job deserve access to regular, reliable COVID-19 testing.
1275609235171180545 2020-06-23 18:58:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> Instead of passing police reform or helping hardworking Americans get through this crisis, Republicans are jamming through another one of Trump’s unqualified nominees. It's wrong.  Cory Wilson lacks judicial temperament and experience—and has no place on a Federal Court.
1275597508903747584 2020-06-23 18:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who will expand access to quality, affordable health care — not rip it away.
1275575614607691776 2020-06-23 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To everyone who is scared, hurting, and wondering what's going to happen next: I want you to know I see you. I hear you. And I'll fight for you every single day in the White House.  https://t.co/UDQiuTX69L
1275558250109272064 2020-06-23 15:36:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our planet cannot take four more years of Donald Trump.  https://t.co/0Wrl9URSxF
1275522767094517760 2020-06-23 13:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The American people are tough, resilient, and always full of hope. There’s not a single thing we can't do if we do it together.
1275496343872712705 2020-06-23 11:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's clear Donald Trump will stop at nothing to tear down Obamacare and rip health care away from millions. We cannot let him get away with it. We have to build on the ACA with a new public option to ensure everyone receives the care they deserve.  https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C
1275467864544366596 2020-06-23 09:36:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's pretty simple: If we want to save people's jobs and save people's lives, we need more testing — and we need it faster. The President is intentionally slowing it down.
1275430918946263041 2020-06-23 07:10:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is yet another attempt to distract from this Administration's failure to lead an effective response to COVID-19. Immigrants help grow our economy and create jobs. The President can't scapegoat his way out of this crisis.
1275233359615180800 2020-06-22 18:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's worth repeating that this weekend, President Trump admitted he directed his administration to slow down coronavirus testing in the middle of a global pandemic.  He continues to prove just how unfit he is to lead our nation.
1275218260116549633 2020-06-22 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To Ashley, and all the health care workers on the front lines of this fight, thank you. You are American heroes.  https://t.co/B6UCR5xmhc
1275203915403927555 2020-06-22 16:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tomorrow, President @BarackObama and I are hosting a virtual grassroots fundraiser. We’ll be answering some of your questions and taking a few trips down memory lane. You won’t want to miss it.   Time is running out to reserve your spot. RSVP today:  https://t.co/spYqBqnX0U
1275164153817321473 2020-06-22 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The strength of the LGBTQ+ community has always been rooted in the ability to find hope in spite of setbacks. If we stand together #UnitedByPride, we'll get through this — and emerge stronger.  https://t.co/nXPtQqQB98
1275151570410393612 2020-06-22 12:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No one should have to choose between their paycheck and their health. That's why my plan for a safe and effective reopening ensures everyone has access to testing and paid leave for all those who get sick from COVID-19.  Read more here:  https://t.co/v6hImc0J3q
1275109292014620672 2020-06-22 09:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if we give him eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.  We can't stand by and let that happen.
1275057198687596545 2020-06-22 06:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> From my days as a public defender to my time as Vice President — I've spent my career fighting against injustice. And I'm not finished yet.  https://t.co/vJ7jDk9OCH
1274910217508196352 2020-06-21 20:40:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump talks tough on Venezuela, but admires thugs and dictators like Nicolas Maduro.   As President, I will stand with the Venezuelan people and for democracy.
1274899809791508480 2020-06-21 19:59:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump opposed sanctioning China’s government over its atrocious human rights violations to protect his hollow trade deal and serve his own personal interests.  Where Trump has been weak, I will be strong, clear, and consistent in standing up for America's values and its people.
1274850243671097347 2020-06-21 16:42:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> My dad instilled a lot in me, but perhaps most important is the belief that there’s no higher calling than to be a good parent. Happy Father’s Day to all the dads working to help raise their children — and all our children — to be honorable, generous, and kind.  https://t.co/Lsm7AkABTn
1274821636466892806 2020-06-21 14:48:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> I can't believe I have to say this, but we should be speeding up testing — not slowing it down.  https://t.co/zuZh7DiQ9X
1274785156050464768 2020-06-21 12:24:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we’ve made some of our greatest progress. If we stand together, as one America, we'll rise stronger than before.  https://t.co/buzkmkM1Gf
1274535081470824451 2020-06-20 19:50:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> Speed up the testing.
1274503550358478850 2020-06-20 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I've found that the way to overcome enormous tragedy in your life is to turn that grief and pain into purpose. Christian Cooper and I discussed how we can take our collective pain in this moment and turn it into a catalyst for change:  https://t.co/uPtszYLXxN
1274486151714353152 2020-06-20 16:35:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> This nation has always strived to serve as a beacon of hope, but Trump has made it clear that he does not believe our country should be a place of refuge.   As president, I'll recommit to building a more inclusive and welcoming America. #WorldRefugeeDay    https://t.co/akD4aANCia
1274467563745865729 2020-06-20 15:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks credit me for speaking out on marriage equality in 2012 — but I'm not the one who took a real risk. Countless others did the hard work and paid a price just for being themselves. Christian Cooper and I discussed the trailblazers who came before us and the work that remains:  https://t.co/bEPmsRgZDo
1274452967211569155 2020-06-20 14:24:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he’s willing to put people at risk and violate CDC guidelines — as long as they sign a waiver promising not to hold his campaign liable.  Unbelievable.
1274425788117417986 2020-06-20 12:36:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Tulsa Race Massacre is one of the worst incidents of racial violence in our history — and it has been erased from our national consciousness for far too long.  It’s time we reckon with what happened in 1921.  https://t.co/wYX3Adq3vN
1274392820938309634 2020-06-20 10:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Christian Cooper’s encounter in Central Park was another wake-up call for our nation and a reminder of the work that remains to root out hate and intolerance. I'm grateful for Christian's support and know with folks like him leading the way, we'll get the job done.  https://t.co/XWhcTjbo0t
1274362370375274496 2020-06-20 08:24:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're months into this pandemic and still don't have proper testing, PPE, or clear nationwide guidance. Instead, Donald Trump:  - Pushes dangerous, disproven drugs - Stands in the way of the CDC - Refuses to wear a mask  He is failing even the most basic test of leadership.
1274137388227465216 2020-06-19 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know it can be hard to keep faith that we will ever achieve that more perfect union we strive to be. But ours is a union worth fighting for — and we are all called to the cause.  None of us can turn away. None of us can stay silent.
1274115997029421056 2020-06-19 16:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump’s failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies on Twitter has cost us lives — and is putting hope for an economic recovery at risk.
1274081268142137350 2020-06-19 13:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important — who we want to be. It’s all at stake.  That's the case we're making in our first TV ad of the general election:  https://t.co/gGeSmBIIxA
1274033704587767814 2020-06-19 10:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> #Juneteenth reminds us of how vulnerable our nation is to being poisoned by systems and acts of inhumanity—but it's also a reminder of our ability to change. Together, we can lay the roots of real and lasting justice, and become the extraordinary nation that was promised to all.
1273816170081193984 2020-06-18 20:13:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> Amy — from the moment you announced you were running for president in a snowstorm, it wasn't hard to see you had the grit and determination to do anything you set your mind to. You know how to get things done. With your help, we’re going to beat Donald Trump.
1273786324512763904 2020-06-18 18:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To all the Dreamers who make our country better and stronger every single day: Thank you. This country needs you. #HomeIsHere  https://t.co/VZPVqY1cgq
1273778774849404928 2020-06-18 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The decisions of the last few days should remind us all of the immense power of the Supreme Court — and the generational impact its justices can have.  We have the power to shape the Court's future this November — and we can’t forget that.
1273767450543304705 2020-06-18 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm ready on day one. After more than three years in office, why isn't Donald Trump ready?  https://t.co/ksgxTsG7QK
1273753609302351872 2020-06-18 16:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Dreamers are Americans. Period.
1273740271214227456 2020-06-18 15:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Just like Donald Trump couldn’t wish COVID-19 away in March, and just like he couldn’t tweet it away in April — he can’t ignore it away in June.  https://t.co/nOBnrL4rWi
1273722153301655554 2020-06-18 14:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here’s my promise to you: On day one, I’ll send a bill to Congress that creates a clear roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and 11 million undocumented people who are already strengthening our nation. It’s long overdue.
1273701510380126212 2020-06-18 12:37:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> It didn’t have to be this bad. But we have a president who is more interested in taking a victory lap than he is in doing the work needed to solve this crisis.  We need a president who will put the American people first — and actually do the work.
1273678505901948928 2020-06-18 11:06:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thanks, Barack. You're right — and we won't stop until every Dreamer feels safe in this country.
1273670561864929280 2020-06-18 10:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he has inherited in his life, he has squandered it.  https://t.co/kxBBzhxvxc
1273646151024214016 2020-06-18 08:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Supreme Court’s ruling today is a victory made possible by the courage and resilience of hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients who bravely stood up and refused to be ignored. And as President, I will get to work immediately to make it permanent.  https://t.co/xKkCp4P9Ff
1273431486339796994 2020-06-17 18:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump wants to style himself a wartime president against an invisible enemy — but he has surrendered the fight.  Instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he has waved the white flag and retreated.
1273416386841214976 2020-06-17 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Vice President Pence claimed success because COVID-19 deaths are “down to” fewer than 750 a day.  That's more than 20,000 a month — and they're self-congratulating? Unbelievable.  It may be good enough for President Trump, but it will never be acceptable if I am President.  https://t.co/9h08nxjC6k
1273410413569495040 2020-06-17 17:21:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m proud to stand with folks across the country participating in today’s #WorkersFirst Caravan. Senate Republicans need to pass the #HeroesAct now and take action to root out systemic racism.
1273398770944770048 2020-06-17 16:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If John Bolton's accounts are true, it’s not only morally repugnant, it’s a violation of Donald Trump’s sacred duty to the American people to protect America’s interests and defend our values.
1273361303973900289 2020-06-17 14:06:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and failed to take the action necessary to contain it — and now in many states, COVID cases are on the rise again.  This president has failed to lead our nation.
1273333339710160896 2020-06-17 12:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Five years ago, nine good souls were ripped from this world — killed by hate and white supremacy. Today, we honor the memory of the Emanuel Nine and the unspeakable grace of those they left behind.  https://t.co/zpVG2ak8aK
1273321785027518464 2020-06-17 11:29:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm in Darby, Pennsylvania, to discuss how we can make sure the country's reopening is safe, effective, and gets Americans back to work. Tune in:  https://t.co/VaCPc32w9A
1273269670796288002 2020-06-17 08:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The truth of our nation is that too often the color of your skin alone can endanger your life and, for far too long, systemic racism has oppressed communities of color in the United States.  It has to change.
1273050224144023552 2020-06-16 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who chooses unity over division.
1273034393175625730 2020-06-16 16:27:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Donald Trump is running the most corrupt administration in modern American history.
1273014488858583040 2020-06-16 15:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have the power to write the future we want for this country. One where health care is a right, we lead the world in the fight against climate change, we end our gun violence epidemic, and our government works for all — not just the powerful.  Let’s do it together.
1272989827282001921 2020-06-16 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t forget that in the middle of a global pandemic, the Trump Administration is trying to gut Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's morally reprehensible.
1272940249648377856 2020-06-16 10:13:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Systemic racism pervades every part of our society, including law enforcement — and we have to do the hard work to root it out. In January, I sat down with Jake, a field organizer on our campaign, to listen to what he had to say and discuss how we can move forward:  https://t.co/mVkxpWxbod
1272911057330167813 2020-06-16 08:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This virus won’t just go away because you want it to, Mr. President. It’s time for you to step up and do your job.
1272715518743584768 2020-06-15 19:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Los Dreamers son estadounidenses. Trump les quitó la protección que lograron con tanto esfuerzo. Esto es inaceptable. El primer día de mi presidencia enviaré un proyecto de ley al Congreso que protegerá a los beneficiarios de DACA de la deportación.  https://t.co/mGmTA03HEq
1272699161016582145 2020-06-15 18:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> LGBTQ+ rights are human rights. Period.
1272690604464431104 2020-06-15 17:41:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, I’ve got some big news: Next week, I’m getting together with my friend and former boss, President @BarackObama, for a virtual grassroots fundraiser. We would love to see you there.   Chip in now to get your ticket:  https://t.co/UD3RHHKIw1
1272687836349837313 2020-06-15 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Dreamers are Americans. But Trump's ripped away the hard-won protections of DACA recipients, throwing their lives into upheaval. It’s unacceptable, and on day one of my presidency I will protect them from deportation and send a bill to Congress.  https://t.co/YlvFuCaTrZ
1272663928728743937 2020-06-15 15:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn’t, and it won’t. American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.   It's up to all of us to do the hard work to ensure the American ideal finally wins out.  https://t.co/iUyi82zXN7
1272631315775586306 2020-06-15 13:45:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm grateful for @PPact's support and proud to stand with them in this fight. As president, I’m going to do everything in my power to expand access to quality, affordable health care — including reproductive health care.
1272619889501454337 2020-06-15 13:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19, but he does bear full responsibility for his slow, uncoordinated, bungled response.  https://t.co/IUdWpqZncn
1272579623285448706 2020-06-15 10:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Race-neutral policies are not a sufficient response to race-based disparities. We need to tackle systemic racism head-on and ensure everyone has a fair shot at the American dream.  Here’s what I would do as president:  https://t.co/Ni1rAm8DNZ
1272557729257672704 2020-06-15 08:53:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today's decision is another step in our march toward equality for all. The Supreme Court has confirmed the simple but profoundly American idea that every human being should be treated with respect. But we're not done.  https://t.co/Bz4SMA9tgb
1272318150525280257 2020-06-14 17:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> After reports of wealthy Trump donors getting millions in relief meant for small businesses, the administration is now refusing to disclose where the PPP money went. It's unacceptable.  The American people deserve answers.  https://t.co/F2n3PA7RZU
1272295752941748224 2020-06-14 15:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In every corner of the country, people are raising their voices and demanding justice. It gives me so much hope.  Together, we’re going to transform this nation and ensure justice finally rings out for all.
1272268573646315525 2020-06-14 13:44:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who heals — not one who fans the flames of hate.   We need a president who unites — not one who sows further discord for political gain.   We need a president who leads the way with a steady hand — not one who incites violence with his erratic tweets.
1272223527035265025 2020-06-14 10:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re facing some of the greatest challenges in our nation’s history — and it’s clear Donald Trump isn’t up for the job.  We need real leadership, right now.
1272182010816143360 2020-06-14 08:00:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to ensure every worker called back on the job has access to regular, reliable COVID-19 testing and effective personal protective equipment.  https://t.co/lDPQP3jZkw
1271960543927037953 2020-06-13 17:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who will fight to further LGBTQ+ equality — not roll back the hard-won progress we've already made.
1271925314340388876 2020-06-13 15:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need real policing reform — and we need it now.  https://t.co/HkBvD8QsmL
1271895113149681670 2020-06-13 13:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our nation is at an inflection point. We can't go back to the way things were before — we have to take a bold step forward and usher in a new era of equality and opportunity.  We can do it, together.
1271876239255633920 2020-06-13 11:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here's my promise to you: I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our nation — not use them for political gain.  We shouldn’t accept anything less from an American president.  https://t.co/I0r60NW4SU
1271851324393451521 2020-06-13 10:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a national ban on chokeholds. Now.
1271814582265188352 2020-06-13 07:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. That is truer today than ever. If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will fundamentally alter the character of this nation.   We can’t let that happen.
1271611242285686784 2020-06-12 18:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In light of Donald Trump's inhumane reversal of protections for transgender people, I want to share a conversation I had a few weeks ago. Adi deserves to be treated with the same respect and dignity as anyone else. Period.  https://t.co/nr1u0vOvog
1271604689809833991 2020-06-12 17:45:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> On the fourth anniversary of Pulse. In the middle of Pride month. During a global pandemic.  Donald Trump's cruelty truly knows no bounds. We have to defeat him this November.
1271572403563507712 2020-06-12 15:37:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> Two years after Trump's Singapore meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, the U.S. and our allies are less safe and Kim's arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles keeps growing. Photo-ops and love letters are no substitute for deterrence and principled diplomacy.
1271559904105385984 2020-06-12 14:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Medgar Evers once said, "freedom has never been free." On this day in 1963, he paid the ultimate price in pursuit of freedom for his brothers and sisters. He was gunned down fighting to end racial injustice. We must honor him by carrying forward that cause in our own lives today.
1271537758075367424 2020-06-12 13:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Four years ago today, 49 lives were cut short in an act of unspeakable terrorism at Pulse nightclub. As we remember those we lost — including so many in the LGBTQ+ and Hispanic communities — we have to double down on our efforts to #HonorThemWithAction.  https://t.co/TKaZ4M7IFF
1271494978213040128 2020-06-12 10:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need real policing reform, and we need it now. Congress should immediately:  - Outlaw chokeholds - Improve oversight and accountability - Create a model use of force standard - Stop the transfer of weapons of war to local police forces
1271464778238537729 2020-06-12 08:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump forgot about COVID-19, but COVID-19 didn’t forget about us.   The President couldn’t wish away the virus in April, he couldn’t tweet it away in May, and he can’t ignore it away in June.
1271436340127608836 2020-06-12 06:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our country is crying out for leadership that Donald Trump can’t deliver.  https://t.co/QHvUdgg6Io
1271250364570861569 2020-06-11 18:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who chooses hope over fear.
1271231993607598084 2020-06-11 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can't let history repeat itself — Facebook needs to act now to stop the spread of disinformation and protect our elections. Watch my deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield break down what's happening and how you can help us fix it:  https://t.co/WYMMAWkuLZ  https://t.co/OGG2wwtW2P
1271216894025052160 2020-06-11 16:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> COVID-19 can affect anyone, anywhere — but it doesn't impact every community equally. Watch as Dr. Ebony Jade Hilton explains how it’s impacting communities of color:  https://t.co/3uuXEsfyv4
1271207815428874241 2020-06-11 15:28:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> While the president was spiking the football and taking a victory lap, another 1.5 million Americans filed new unemployment claims last week.   He is completely oblivious to what's really happening in this country — and hardworking Americans are paying the price.
1271165807427551232 2020-06-11 12:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to ensure our economic reopening is safe and strong — and builds the foundation for an economy that works for everyone. Today, I'm releasing my plan to make that happen:  https://t.co/v6hImc0J3q
1271134703383310337 2020-06-11 10:38:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to make sure our economic reopening is safe, effective, and gets Americans back to work. Tune in for a roundtable discussion on how we can make that happen:  https://t.co/7WIbtob6WE
1271121663476682753 2020-06-11 09:46:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to make sure our economic reopening is safe, effective, and gets Americans back to work. Tune in for a roundtable discussion on how we can make that happen:  https://t.co/lWNMjkTf06
1271114212333453312 2020-06-11 09:16:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> With less than 150 days until Election Day, the stakes couldn't be higher. We've got to fix Facebook to protect our democracy and ensure fair elections.   If you agree, sign the open letter today to demand Facebook take action. #MoveFastFixIt  https://t.co/6Hmta4UxS9
1271114211410706432 2020-06-11 09:16:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> So far, Facebook has failed to enact any real reforms to stop the spread of disinformation on its platform. Time is running out.   Today, we're releasing an open letter demanding the company change its policies:  https://t.co/S1WIQTsfEL
1271114210613899264 2020-06-11 09:16:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, we saw in 2016 what can happen when social media platforms are left unchecked and allow disinformation to run rampant. It puts the very integrity of our elections at risk.   We simply cannot let it happen again in 2020.
1271072191929561088 2020-06-11 06:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's in our darkest moments that we've produced some of our greatest progress — and we have that opportunity once again. Let's make this a moment of action to address systemic racism and propel our nation into an era of true equality and opportunity.
1270887221760049157 2020-06-10 18:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There is systemic racism not just in our law enforcement but also in housing, education, and everything we do — and we have to do the hard work to end it.  https://t.co/w9H77Jbuqa
1270872122475175938 2020-06-10 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to make this an era of action — starting with real police reform. No more excuses. No more delays.   Add your name to demand Congress ban chokeholds — and pass real police reform — right now:  https://t.co/Sa6sPy2BtS
1270860797938466818 2020-06-10 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This pandemic isn't just going to go away because you want it to, Mr. President. Step up and do your job before your negligence costs even more lives than it already has.  https://t.co/L6QfV31eFQ
1270834373626146817 2020-06-10 14:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ignore the polls. We can't take anything for granted this November — the stakes are simply too high.   Register to vote:  https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M   Donate:  https://t.co/BpHN3x7cbq   Volunteer:  https://t.co/pTOKTUQT4t   Let's get to work.
1270799392782512129 2020-06-10 12:26:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Nothing about the fights we're facing will be easy. Racism has been a fixture in our society for hundreds of years.    But I’m ready to get to work on day one. We can’t accept anything less from an American president.
1270758120910962694 2020-06-10 09:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump’s hate-filled, conspiracy-laden rhetoric is inflaming the racial divides in our country—but just fixing the way the president talks won’t cut it. We need to root out systemic racism and ensure Black Americans have a real shot to get ahead.  https://t.co/FhgRNPjKR8
1270727922022637574 2020-06-10 07:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America was founded on the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all. We’ve never fully lived up to that promise — and we can’t rest until we finally do.
1270533056584126464 2020-06-09 18:47:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> From ballot shortages and issues with machines to hours-long lines — what happened today in Georgia should enrage us all. We need to act now to prevent it from happening again in November. Our democracy depends on it.
1270509734206947328 2020-06-09 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Because of Donald Trump's negligence and incompetence:   - More than 110,000 people have died - We have nearly 2 million cases of COVID-19 - Over 20 million Americans are out of work   And yet he’s patting himself on the back. Unbelievable.
1270498411238748161 2020-06-09 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Small businesses like Rafael's are the backbone of communities all across this nation. We have to do so much more to help them through this crisis.  https://t.co/msi1oZ6P24
1270471985538240514 2020-06-09 14:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be clear: We can't leave this moment and once again turn away and do nothing.   We need justice. We need action. We need reform.
1270427945375580160 2020-06-09 11:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Grief is a heavy burden to bear — and it's even harder with the eyes of the world watching. I know. But that burden is now a purpose — to change the world for the better in the name of George Floyd.  That's the message I shared with his loved ones during today's service:  https://t.co/2LKJzwBUSO
1270409071250812930 2020-06-09 10:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My Dad used to say there's no greater sin than the abuse of power.  Whether it's an officer bloodying a peaceful protester or a President defending him with a conspiracy theory he saw on TV.  I'm a Catholic – just like Martin. Our faith says that we can't accept either.
1270378266684252160 2020-06-09 08:32:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> 13 million people who had jobs when you took office are unemployed today.
1270331308514799618 2020-06-09 05:26:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Together, let’s make this an era of action.  https://t.co/JHt3sELUCV
1270163704248537090 2020-06-08 18:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This moment is a wake-up call for all of us. It's long past time we deal with systemic racism, growing economic inequality, and the denial of the promise of this nation to so many.  https://t.co/IV4EVWAfRO
1270156154430271490 2020-06-08 17:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump inherited the longest economic expansion in history from the Obama-Biden Administration, but like everything else he’s inherited, he has squandered it.  https://t.co/395A6eJAzm
1270147346404216832 2020-06-08 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To everyone speaking out and peacefully demanding justice across the nation: I see you, I hear you, and I stand with you.  https://t.co/gsqiDcEZUo
1270131491935223809 2020-06-08 16:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> At every turn, President Trump ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and misled the American people — and we’re all paying the price every single day.  https://t.co/klaYVm3gpY
1270095756486033408 2020-06-08 13:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We've made incredible progress on LGBTQ+ equality, but we still have further to go. We can't rest until everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law—regardless of who they are or whom they love.  Join #OutForBiden and let's get to work:  https://t.co/UMiuglr9XX  https://t.co/hHNVoCU2q5
1270049200374288386 2020-06-08 10:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're facing some of the greatest challenges in our history, and Donald Trump is patting himself on the back. He just has no idea what’s really going on in this country.   It's time for him to step out of his bunker and look around at the consequences of his words and actions.
1270002894562119680 2020-06-08 07:41:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending. But we have the power to write the future we want for this nation.  Don't let anyone tell you differently.
1269788733613760512 2020-06-07 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this moment.
1269766084057391106 2020-06-07 16:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our nation is at an inflection point. We can choose four more years of Donald Trump's poisonous rhetoric and divisive politics — or we can take the next great step forward.  https://t.co/AbLAYAUsZx
1269743435734384641 2020-06-07 14:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> These disparities have plagued our nation for far too long. It’s time we rebuild our country upon more just and equal foundations — and finally close race-based wealth and income gaps.  https://t.co/KforFaypAP
1269715752547807233 2020-06-07 12:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need to build an economy that rewards work — not just wealth.  https://t.co/NANxlpk538
1269688626344058881 2020-06-07 10:52:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> This isn’t about politics. This is about the future of our country. Grateful for your support, Secretary Powell.
1269650321522831360 2020-06-07 08:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The words of a president matter. And time and time again, Donald Trump has callously used his to incite violence, stoke the flames of hatred and division, and drive us further apart.   We cannot give him another four years in the White House.
1269426345391644673 2020-06-06 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need to stand up as a nation — with the Black community and with all minority communities — and come together as one America. Because the pain is too immense for one community to bear alone.   It is the duty of every American to grapple with it — and grapple with it now.
1269411246228586505 2020-06-06 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I promised George Floyd's family that he wouldn’t just become another hashtag — and I intend to keep that promise.   We need justice. And we need real police reform to ensure this never occurs again.
1269393629983969280 2020-06-06 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To all those families who are scared, and hurting, and wondering what’s going to happen next: I want you to know I see you. I won’t ever forget you. And I won’t be satisfied until this economy starts working for all of you.  https://t.co/YxQ2OaeSyQ
1269365948315652096 2020-06-06 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, we honor those who answered duty’s call on June 6, 1944, on the beachheads of Normandy. We must be a living memorial to their bravery and sacrifice—and recognize always that our strength is rooted in our fervid and unfailing defense of democratic rights and freedoms. #DDay
1269354622881128451 2020-06-06 12:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, the pain is so raw it can be hard to keep faith that justice is at hand or that we will ever achieve the more perfect union we all want. But ours is a union worth fighting for, and we are all called to the cause.   No one can stay silent.  https://t.co/nZjQdJGKbD
1269335748542558208 2020-06-06 11:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're just 150 days out from Election Day, and the stakes have never been higher. We have to defeat Donald Trump, and once we do, we won’t just rebuild this country — we'll transform it. Together.   Help us make it happen:  https://t.co/AflPBScS1L
1269300516565086213 2020-06-06 09:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump was warned, but he failed to act. Now more than 20 million Americans are out of a job and paying the price. It didn’t have to be this bad.  https://t.co/Hut7pquZUU
1269279125463797762 2020-06-06 07:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 150 days.
1269107491708850176 2020-06-05 20:22:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, tonight we secured the 1,991 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination. I'm going to spend every day fighting to earn your vote so that, together, we can win the battle for the soul of this nation.  https://t.co/sl3wFGabpg
1269098989821059072 2020-06-05 19:49:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight, I’m thinking of Breonna Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer. Today should have been her daughter's birthday. I've talked a lot about turning pain into purpose. But for Breonna and Tamika, it’s on us to find purpose. Our country needs to act — now.  https://t.co/Ql2SyMew76
1269045083254345728 2020-06-05 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump still doesn’t get it. He’s out there spiking the football — completely oblivious to the tens of millions of people who are facing the greatest struggle of their lives.  https://t.co/ZNbTRsdVdS
1269024950477746179 2020-06-05 14:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This #GunViolenceAwarenessDay, I am reflecting on the life of Hadiya Pendleton, whose murder inspired the #WearOrange movement.  The hard truth is that Black Americans are ten times more likely to die by gun homicide. It has to stop.
1269018659843985408 2020-06-05 14:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When it comes to this economic crisis, Donald Trump either doesn’t know what’s going on, or he just doesn’t care.  https://t.co/db8axnf704
1269001043251208192 2020-06-05 13:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is dangerously unfit to lead our nation through this moment. But don't just take my word for it:  https://t.co/eD9z51pXDQ
1268986698542845957 2020-06-05 12:23:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s be clear about something: The depth of this job crisis is not attributable to an act of God — but to the failure of a President.
1268973258537402371 2020-06-05 11:29:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> George Floyd’s last words, “I can’t breathe,” have echoed across our nation and around the world.  For the President to try to put any other words in his mouth is frankly despicable.
1268950854784053248 2020-06-05 10:00:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tune in as I speak about the latest jobs report and the state of the economy:  https://t.co/pfELb1jmqa
1268941941158432769 2020-06-05 09:25:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> Those who have worked the closest with Donald Trump know how unfit he is to serve as President.
1268923532467040258 2020-06-05 08:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It is long past time we made the promise of this nation real for all of our people.
1268710378025803776 2020-06-04 18:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us.   We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us.   We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us.
1268695278611095557 2020-06-04 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t take four more years of this.
1268683953776537600 2020-06-04 16:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To everyone struggling with mental health—you're not alone. There is no shame in seeking help, and there shouldn't be any barriers in your way to getting that help.   Together, we can achieve mental health parity, expand access to care, and wipe out the stigma.  https://t.co/QXplsIwYTL
1268663821998206978 2020-06-04 15:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, I’ll do my job and take responsibility. I won’t blame others. And I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you.
1268634880830627841 2020-06-04 13:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are at our best when we open our hearts, not when we clench our fists.
1268609373460402176 2020-06-04 11:23:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jim Mattis and I haven’t always agreed on everything, but you'd be hard pressed to find a more powerful indictment of Trump's actions and character than the one he's written.  "We do not need to militarize our response to protests. We need to unite around a common purpose."
1268582032331935744 2020-06-04 09:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn’t, and it won’t. American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.  It's up to all of us to create the America we know we can be.  https://t.co/LNI2e3d3lz
1268554349866860544 2020-06-04 07:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> More than 42 million Americans have now filed for unemployment in the last three months, and Black and Latino communities are being hit hardest.  https://t.co/qXnKEf1JMF
1268349248170536962 2020-06-03 18:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There’s no time to waste — we need to get to work immediately on real police reform. Congressman @Hakeem_Jeffries has a bill to outlaw chokeholds. Congress should put it on President Trump’s desk in the next few days. Period.  https://t.co/w8XkHwFcBt
1268335406963019776 2020-06-03 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The nation is crying out for leadership — but this president has nothing to offer.
1268325843949907968 2020-06-03 16:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump has turned our country into a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him.  I ask every American to look at where we are now, and think anew: Is this who we are? Is this who we want to be?  https://t.co/taSpWIFT1b
1268291366758445057 2020-06-03 14:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who listens.  https://t.co/aBdClOSDYw
1268264439565807617 2020-06-03 12:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we’ve made some of our greatest progress — and we have that chance once again. We’re not just going to rebuild this nation — we’re going to transform it.   There is nothing we can’t do if we do it together.  https://t.co/iozMdaLtAw
1268233487305199616 2020-06-03 10:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we stand together, we will rise stronger than before. A more equal, more just, more hopeful nation — closer to that more perfect union we must always strive to be.
1268188186905214977 2020-06-03 07:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I ask all of America — not to deny our pain or cover it over — but to use it to compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity for our great democracy.
1267990635174297602 2020-06-02 18:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If the Senate has time to confirm Donald Trump’s unqualified judicial nominees, it has time to pass legislation that will give true meaning to our Constitution’s promise of equal protection under the law.  No more excuses. No more delays.
1267970502871613442 2020-06-02 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When 100,000 Americans died because of his incompetent leadership, this president golfed.  When Americans peacefully protested outside the White House, this president tear-gassed them for a photo-op.  Donald Trump was elected to serve us all — but he only looks out for himself.
1267957164607336448 2020-06-02 16:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. I won’t either.  But I promise you this: I won’t traffic in fear and division or fan the flames of hate. I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country — not use them for political gain.  https://t.co/TfNaoMRZQp
1267914382786224128 2020-06-02 13:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> That’s what the presidency is: a duty of care — to all of us, not just our voters, not just our donors, but all of us.  https://t.co/rWHywb5cHV
1267891230429626368 2020-06-02 11:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> “I can’t breathe.”   George Floyd’s last words. But they didn’t die with him. They’re still being heard. They’re echoing across this nation.   It’s a wake-up call for all of us.  https://t.co/q6kARnpJqU
1267876242075746304 2020-06-02 10:50:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> Julián — I made a promise to George's family that he wouldn't just become another hashtag. We're going to tackle this head on — and we're going to need your help to do it. Grateful for your support.
1267841150326636545 2020-06-02 08:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation.  Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important—who we want to be. It’s all at stake.   That is truer today than ever. And it’s in this urgency we can find the path forward.
1267832845608747009 2020-06-02 07:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The President held up a bible at St. John’s church yesterday. If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something:   That we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves.   That’s hard work. But it’s the work of America.
1267829322548563971 2020-06-02 07:44:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us, leadership that brings us together, leadership that can recognize the pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time.
1267819776291692555 2020-06-02 07:06:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let us vow to make this, at last, an era of action to reverse systemic racism with long overdue and concrete changes.  This morning I'm speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on where we are and where we need to go. Tune in:  https://t.co/1bSdeXp8Rc
1267650896562843648 2020-06-01 19:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Pride is a global movement of love, self-expression, and community — resilient in the face of oppression and fear and hopeful for a better future. This month, let us recommit to those principles and remain steadfast in the fight for justice and equality.  https://t.co/cNxsmEFW6R
1267634400080117761 2020-06-01 18:49:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> He's using the American military against the American people.  He tear-gassed peaceful protesters and fired rubber bullets.  For a photo.  For our children, for the very soul of our country, we must defeat him. But I mean it when I say this: we can only do it together.
1267570366227988482 2020-06-01 14:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In this moment, the very soul of America is at stake.   We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being.   We have to finally make real the American promise: That all men and women are not only equal at creation, but throughout their lives.
1267520286028513281 2020-06-01 11:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Leaders listen.  https://t.co/FPSJP4Fkn3
1267503703927386118 2020-06-01 10:10:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> After another night of unrest in America, I’m hosting a virtual roundtable with mayors from across the country to discuss where we go from here. Tune in:  https://t.co/qyXzbDdSBq
1267216045246382082 2020-05-31 15:07:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are a nation in pain right now, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us.   As President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen, just as I did today visiting the site of last night's protests in Wilmington.  https://t.co/0h2ApbKT0C
1266949697874415618 2020-05-30 21:28:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. Please stay safe. Please take care of each other.  https://t.co/Y224rANwUF
1266874530779275264 2020-05-30 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump’s Tantrum Diplomacy is eroding U.S. credibility on the international stage. Withdrawing from @WHO during a global pandemic is a recipe for disaster and increases the cost of the American response. We must instead rally the world to confront COVID-19.
1266863206334705664 2020-05-30 15:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we are complacent, if we are silent, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence.  None of us can turn away. We all have an obligation to speak out.
1266844333006700550 2020-05-30 14:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You can't defeat bigotry; it only hides. And when leaders give it oxygen — as Donald Trump has done — it comes roaring back.  We all have a moral obligation to stand up, speak out, and hold people accountable.  https://t.co/vES2aIXVGl
1266824199202578433 2020-05-30 13:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, in lifting our ambitions and our imaginations to the heavens, the United States has once more reshaped the future of space travel.  https://t.co/AskxceOJJU
1266799536871112707 2020-05-30 11:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day that Donald Trump spends in the White House, he further debases the values and ideals of our nation. He is wholly unfit to be president.  https://t.co/Fq90hSLuLz
1266527243699970049 2020-05-29 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence.  This is a national crisis — and we need real leadership right now.
1266515917917302789 2020-05-29 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are a country with an open wound.  None of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us any longer can hear those words — “I can’t breathe” — and do nothing.  We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being.  https://t.co/veodlR1UYU
1266489745682595841 2020-05-29 15:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.  It’s time for us to face the deep, open wound we have in this nation.  We need justice for George Floyd.
1266423158766047232 2020-05-29 10:36:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tune in as I address the unfolding situation in Minnesota and the killing of George Floyd:  https://t.co/AKk14gGif5
1266369894502686721 2020-05-29 07:04:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> I will be speaking more about the events in Minnesota later today.
1266369893403770886 2020-05-29 07:04:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> I will not lift the President’s tweet. I will not give him that amplification. But he is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many. I’m furious, and you should be too.
1266369892325838850 2020-05-29 07:04:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is not abstract: a black reporter was arrested while doing his job this morning, while the white police officer who killed George Floyd remains free. I am glad swift action was taken, but this, to me, says everything.
1266369891445010432 2020-05-29 07:04:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> Enough.
1266179954389155840 2020-05-28 18:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t allow this crisis to exacerbate the disparities that plague our nation.
1266164854689353731 2020-05-28 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re months into this crisis, and Donald Trump still doesn't have an effective national testing strategy.   I do:  https://t.co/MTnecpzZgv
1266149756650156032 2020-05-28 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ordinary people doing extraordinary things. That's the story of America — and we’re seeing it written every single day. It gives me hope.  https://t.co/hK8AbPKZue
1266134655973064710 2020-05-28 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 100,000+ lives lost across the country. 1,700,000+ confirmed U.S. cases. 40,000,000+ unemployment claims filed.  Donald Trump has failed our nation.
1266112010258911232 2020-05-28 14:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, we learned that another 2.1 million people filed for unemployment last week, bringing the total number of new claims since this crisis began to more than 40 million. It's just the latest evidence of Donald Trump’s utter failure of leadership.  https://t.co/YSHGLBdMLG
1266098165511380992 2020-05-28 13:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thirty years ago, I proudly cosponsored the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act. It was an enormous step forward, but there's more work to do. So today, I’m releasing my plan to achieve full participation and equality for people with disabilities:  https://t.co/psuNvKzYej
1266052867200180224 2020-05-28 10:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The hard truth is that this crisis didn’t have to be this bad.
1266014363225219075 2020-05-28 07:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Two tweets from the same day in October.  https://t.co/rsSslLCsTW
1265799950253690880 2020-05-27 17:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day Donald Trump proves how unfit he is to lead our nation.  https://t.co/zymzZw8619
1265792096453230592 2020-05-27 16:48:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> Presidents are supposed to lead by example — and every day Donald Trump proves how incapable he is of doing that.
1265783592594087944 2020-05-27 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> George Floyd’s life mattered.  https://t.co/1XoadyjRWw
1265770716550574086 2020-05-27 15:23:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@DrBiden and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Larry Kramer, an American hero. Through his activism, Larry taught us all how to speak up and demand our government do its job. His outspokenness raised our consciousness on HIV/AIDS and saved countless lives.
1265757168504049664 2020-05-27 14:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There are moments in our history so grim, so heart-rending, that they're forever fixed in each of our hearts as shared grief. Today is one of those moments. 100,000 lives have now been lost to this virus.  To those hurting, I'm so sorry for your loss. The nation grieves with you.  https://t.co/SBBRKV4mPZ
1265726466051977218 2020-05-27 12:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Over the last few months, countless Asian Americans have been threatened, attacked, and blamed for COVID-19. They've cruelly been made the scapegoat by the most powerful man on the planet, President Trump. It has to end.  Read more from @TammyforIL and me:  https://t.co/W7h54A91U9
1265689220603150337 2020-05-27 10:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re in the middle of a global pandemic — and not only is Donald Trump preventing people from getting the health insurance they need, but he’s also actively trying to terminate the insurance millions already have.  It’s morally reprehensible.
1265652855651762177 2020-05-27 07:35:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tune in now as @TomWolfPA joins me for a conversation on how COVID-19 is impacting states:  https://t.co/3gMLagg78X
1265624830096936960 2020-05-27 05:44:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> This morning, I’ll be joined by @TomWolfPA for a conversation on how COVID-19 is making an impact on states.   Tune in live at 10:30AM EDT:  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50  https://t.co/D6Ewy1xm78
1265472291099549699 2020-05-26 19:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Last year California passed #AB5, affording gig workers protections and benefits like a minimum wage and overtime pay.  Now, gig economy giants are trying to gut the law and exempt their workers. It's unacceptable.  I urge Californians to vote no on the initiative this November.
1265455605076185089 2020-05-26 18:31:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> George Floyd deserved better and his family deserves justice. His life mattered.  I'm grateful for the swift action in Minneapolis to fire the officers involved — they must be held responsible for their egregious actions. The FBI should conduct a thorough investigation.
1265445256465731586 2020-05-26 17:50:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> Wear a mask.
1265435045780570112 2020-05-26 17:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump's wealthy donors got tens of millions of dollars in relief, while countless small businesses were turned away. It's no wonder he didn't want any oversight.  We need a government that works for all — not just the super-wealthy.
1265417430194630659 2020-05-26 16:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The truth is asking for money is the worst part of running for president—especially in times as tough as these. But we’re coming up on our end of month fundraising deadline, and I need your help to ensure we hit our goal.  If you can, please chip in today:  https://t.co/af28OgWn2G
1265394277137481728 2020-05-26 14:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 1 in 4 U.S. workers has filed for unemployment benefits in the last 10 weeks. It’s a crisis unlike anything we’ve seen in our lifetime — and the Trump Administration is failing to do enough to help.
1265364582182162432 2020-05-26 12:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, today we’re launching #League46⚾️ — a next generation coalition ready to make Donald Trump a one-term president. We've got unlimited capacity to create change — and together, we’re going to transform this country.  Join today:  https://t.co/Rnwttcaugo  https://t.co/Dbez4mtrwx
1265327084710264833 2020-05-26 10:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> So much of this could have been prevented if we had a president who listened to someone other than himself.
1265289085150736384 2020-05-26 07:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are months into this crisis, and Donald Trump still doesn't have a comprehensive plan when it comes to COVID-19 or the economy. It's unacceptable. I released a detailed plan laying out what I would do months ago, and have built on it since. Take a look:  https://t.co/xjxsDn2qCD
1265070142125293568 2020-05-25 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There’s not a single thing the American people can’t do if we do it together.
1265024844887965700 2020-05-25 14:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have always been able to take crises and turn them into opportunities — and we have the chance to do that once again. If we match our ambitions to the scale of the challenges we face, we can and will transform our country for generations to come.
1264995588594073602 2020-05-25 12:03:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> This ruling goes a long way toward protecting the sacred right to vote, but there's still work to do. We've got to ensure everyone — including individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies — has the right to make their voice heard at the ballot box.
1264936762570407936 2020-05-25 08:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To all the members of our military and our military families, especially those who have lost their service member, thank you. We owe you. We can never lessen the magnitude of your loss, but this I can promise you: we will never forget. #MemorialDay  https://t.co/b5vDrYiPL5
1264706495096262662 2020-05-24 16:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The presidency is about a lot more than tweeting from your golf cart. It requires taking on the ultimate responsibility for the biggest decisions in the world. Donald Trump simply wasn’t prepared for that. I promise you I will be.
1264681329158795264 2020-05-24 15:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Climate change poses an existential threat to our future — and time is running out to address it. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and tackle the challenge head-on.
1264654905714728960 2020-05-24 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hunger today isn’t about scarcity — it’s about a massive failure in leadership.   If I were President, I’d immediately work with @chefjoseandres to empower our restaurants to be part of the solution as families go hungry during the COVID-19 crisis.  https://t.co/dGqSDgqXpM
1264632385691410433 2020-05-24 12:00:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re in the middle of a global pandemic, and the Trump Administration is trying to prevent people from getting health care.  https://t.co/B46LlVfWaL
1264600798865944577 2020-05-24 09:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks write letters to me asking all kinds of questions, but Jack's question on my favorite ice cream flavor might be the best one yet.  Here’s what I told him:  https://t.co/GGlLFK1Q6S  https://t.co/Hd5lTk1SlM
1264558017321644032 2020-05-24 07:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Make no mistake: I believe our best days still lie ahead. We can and will transform this nation — together.
1264374557860716544 2020-05-23 18:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Nearly 100,000 lives have been lost, and tens of millions are out of work.  Meanwhile, the president spent his day golfing.  https://t.co/H1BVNtgVjA
1264364239885676544 2020-05-23 18:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As Ramadan draws to an end, @DrBiden and I want to wish a safe and warm celebration to our Muslim friends and neighbors. Even though we can't be all together to celebrate, we hope it is filled with joy, family, and success for the year to come. #EidMubarak
1264318941620350976 2020-05-23 15:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump has failed to live up to our trust and treaty obligations to Native Americans. It’s unacceptable.  I’ll make meaningful investments in Indian Country — including increasing funding for Indian Health Services and making that funding mandatory.  https://t.co/JIObym7aXI
1264291259054768128 2020-05-23 13:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can protect the sacred right to vote and protect public health at the same time.
1264264835036000257 2020-05-23 11:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The hard truth is Donald Trump ignored the warnings of health experts and intelligence agencies, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak.  It’s one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history.
1264232120425123841 2020-05-23 09:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 36,000 Americans could be alive today if President Trump had acted sooner. Let's put that into perspective:  https://t.co/i2bmqRe86r
1264198145988104192 2020-05-23 07:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're in the midst of the worst economic crisis in our lifetime, and Senate Republicans continue to delay relief for the American people saying, "I don’t see the need right now." Unbelievable.  We've got to take back the Senate this November.  https://t.co/ij73z7Oq9P
1264005770422738947 2020-05-22 18:30:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> Adi is an incredible young advocate for the transgender community. He also graduated high school today. We wanted to say congrats...with a couple friends!  https://t.co/1bDml2YI8Q
1263970782889287680 2020-05-22 16:11:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> Chip in to help make it happen:  https://t.co/63RkztugeC
1263963348405678080 2020-05-22 15:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No worker’s life is worth getting a cheaper hamburger. Period.  https://t.co/hMkO4ILgmx
1263944725624578048 2020-05-22 14:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Think of how many small businesses could have been helped with the $47 million that went to private jet companies owned by wealthy Trump donors. It’s ridiculous.  We need a president who puts hardworking Americans ahead of the wealthy and well-connected.  https://t.co/A7Pn17J6id
1263917546748514304 2020-05-22 12:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We will get through this, and we will come out stronger. I promise.  https://t.co/qXIjeMuwbZ
1263907481216057346 2020-05-22 12:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In announcing the intent to withdraw from the Open Skies Treaty, President Trump has doubled down on his short-sighted policy of going it alone and abandoning American leadership.  https://t.co/mbO2EBCYJu
1263887347650899970 2020-05-22 10:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I've said it before, and I'll say it again: No company pulling in billions of dollars in profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers.  It's time for Amazon to pay its fair share.  https://t.co/rsfBvcjqvX
1263867235224834048 2020-05-22 09:20:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> Join Andrew Yang to discuss the economic impact of COVID-19. Tune in now:  https://t.co/bKZ6bvcfXv
1263862182636408833 2020-05-22 09:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the middle of this crisis, President Trump is trying to cut food assistance. It’s morally bankrupt.  We should do everything in our power to ensure no one goes hungry in America.
1263829969593004034 2020-05-22 06:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A president who can't handle a crisis is no president at all.  https://t.co/c1vnz3dHsp
1263640722571268098 2020-05-21 18:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It didn’t have to be this bad. The hard truth is that Donald Trump failed to take action, and it cost American lives.  https://t.co/qhkliK1i5Z
1263625569121570819 2020-05-21 17:19:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> Turns out, it takes more than a tweet to implement a comprehensive national testing strategy.
1263608006949797888 2020-05-21 16:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m looking forward to joining my friend @StephenAtHome on the @colbertlateshow tonight. Check out some of my favorite moments from the last time I was on his show — and then make sure to tune in to CBS at 11:35 PM ET.  https://t.co/KfG0ilRVqI
1263584031251152896 2020-05-21 14:34:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> I don't usually Google myself, but I made an exception for @WIRED’s Autocomplete Interview. Check it out:
1263551383904477185 2020-05-21 12:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump’s inaction cost lives.  https://t.co/Pdeb7HVCj3
1263538448507588613 2020-05-21 11:33:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> While we hope to soon return to some sense of normalcy in our lives, we cannot allow ourselves to return to the everyday gun violence that has plagued our past. We need to pass common-sense reforms and end our gun violence epidemic.
1263509860395610113 2020-05-21 09:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I promise you this: A Biden Administration will listen to scientists and heed their advice — not silence them.  https://t.co/hV4HPOmGDV
1263475886445039616 2020-05-21 07:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When I launched my campaign, I said we were in a battle for the soul of the nation — we’re seeing that soul on full display. Folks are reaching out to help one another and doing truly heroic things. It makes me so proud.
1263280851128930304 2020-05-20 18:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This shouldn’t be a partisan issue. We need to ensure every single eligible American can safely make their voice heard this November.  https://t.co/x7S9vkYwUI
1263269526721855488 2020-05-20 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We don't have a food shortage problem — we have a leadership problem.  https://t.co/eFpJ8PGHGM
1263259697177677826 2020-05-20 17:05:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is using a global health crisis as an excuse to deport children and continue separating families. It's heartless and un-American. People across the political spectrum rejected these policies before, and will do so again, because they know families belong together.
1263250653318656002 2020-05-20 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, I’m excited to share that we’re hosting a grassroots fundraiser with @PeteButtigieg. Grassroots donors are the backbone of our campaign — and I want to thank you for all your support.  Chip in any amount to join us Friday afternoon:  https://t.co/B6JZ1XXuyz
1263233036243603457 2020-05-20 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My heart and Jill's go out to the people of Midland, Michigan, experiencing another crisis in the midst of this pandemic.  https://t.co/8XR7XJpznd
1263215923374305280 2020-05-20 14:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump needs to do his job and implement a national testing strategy.
1263185976089890816 2020-05-20 12:13:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> From my home in Delaware to Milwaukee, Wisconsin — join us for a virtual rally at 3:30 PM CT:  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50  https://t.co/5vYn55VS6R
1263150426477727750 2020-05-20 09:51:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump has failed to provide for our nurses and doctors on the frontlines. Now he’s short-changing our troops and their families. Unacceptable.
1263144955867885568 2020-05-20 09:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose to unite rather than divide.
1263112240510627841 2020-05-20 07:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When we emerge from this crisis, we can’t just go back to the way things were before. We need to take this country to a place we’ve never been. Where we finally live up to our highest ideals and everyone gets a full share of the American dream.
1262932298082799624 2020-05-19 19:24:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congratulations to Dr. @iingwen on the start of her second term. Taiwan’s thriving democracy and response to COVID-19 are an example to the world. America’s support for Taiwan must remain strong, principled, and bipartisan.
1262910915768315904 2020-05-19 18:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The United States of America has always emerged stronger from every trial and tribulation — and we will again. We will overcome this.
1262897980799102976 2020-05-19 17:08:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> Fundamentally, this is about whose side the government is on and whether it is accountable to the American people. This is a case I will continue to make, and if elected president will deliver on.  https://t.co/x19ZeMOz4v
1262897979666706435 2020-05-19 17:08:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> That's exactly why @EWarren and I have called for more oversight. We need more conditions on corporations to ensure relief goes to their workers, not their CEOs. No $500 billion slush fund. No blank checks. The Trump Administration is prioritizing big corporations over workers.
1262897978890768384 2020-05-19 17:08:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> During today’s Senate Banking Committee hearing, Secretary @StevenMnuchin1 refused to require corporations benefiting from $500 billion in CARES Act funds to keep workers on their payrolls. @EWarren asked him several times, each time he ducked and refused.
1262885244509671424 2020-05-19 16:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, @DrBiden and I are mourning the death of our dear friend, Annie Glenn. Her long life was filled with great love and great meaning, with purpose and her own brand of uncommon courage.  https://t.co/JnAuBlF41P
1262863098702004224 2020-05-19 14:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight, I'll be joining @chefjoseandres for a virtual town hall to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on food security and the restaurant industry — and what our government should be doing to ensure no one in America goes hungry.  Watch live at 7 PM ET:  https://t.co/KG9y39EA8s
1262835420108292101 2020-05-19 13:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this crisis.  https://t.co/0H3jyciMou
1262797667677212672 2020-05-19 10:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who believes in science.
1262780460905660424 2020-05-19 09:21:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> I am proud to stand with @NationalNurses in calling for a strong OSHA standard for RNs and other frontline health care workers and full utilization of the Defense Production Act to mass produce personal protective equipment.
1262749852976349184 2020-05-19 07:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s time we reward the people who actually make this country work. Not Wall Street CEOs — but the middle class. Ordinary women and men who are capable of doing extraordinary things when given half a chance.  That's who I'll fight for every single day in the White House.
1262548526094929928 2020-05-18 18:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus. But he does bear full responsibility for failing to protect our nation from the worst public health and economic crisis in our lifetime.
1262535439715405824 2020-05-18 17:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> With your help, we'll defeat Donald Trump. And we won't just rebuild this nation — we’ll transform it. I know times are tough, but if you're able, please chip in today to help make it happen:  https://t.co/Wje8LYRL0J
1262508260411621377 2020-05-18 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> One of President Trump's top advisors admitted that this administration "really let the country down" on testing.  He's right. It's long past time for Trump to step up and implement a national testing strategy so we can begin safely reopening the economy.  https://t.co/jDawbgdAzl
1262480579624235008 2020-05-18 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> - Expand vote-by-mail and early voting - Implement online voter registration - Ensure everyone can safely vote in-person  We need to do everything in our power to ensure every American can safely make their voice heard this November.
1262448924608139269 2020-05-18 11:24:13 -0800 <JoeBiden> Companies getting relief from taxpayers have an obligation to protect workers' paychecks, and the Trump Administration has an obligation to hold their feet to the fire to ensure they do.  We need real relief paired with real oversight—not no-strings-attached corporate bailouts.
1262420180690505733 2020-05-18 09:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history — and his recovery efforts are making that clearer than ever.
1262386206865797124 2020-05-18 07:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the middle of the worst public health crisis in our lifetime, President Trump is actively trying to terminate health insurance for millions of Americans. It's unthinkable.  Here's what I would do to ensure everyone has access to the coverage they need:  https://t.co/7kvok6B6if
1262186137868595200 2020-05-17 18:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In times of crisis, Americans stand as one. It's who we are. And it's how we're going to get through this — together.
1262171039863394305 2020-05-17 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A year ago today, the House passed the #EqualityAct, a long-overdue bill that would ensure LGBTQ+ people are treated with dignity and respect under the law. But @SenateMajLdr won't bring it up for a vote. It's unacceptable.  Passing it will be a top legislative priority of mine.
1262154177221808130 2020-05-17 15:53:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm incredibly grateful for everyone who has chipped in to help fuel this campaign — especially in times as tough as these. @EWarren and I called a few folks to thank them for their support:  https://t.co/FPpttl2wkc
1262133289982164992 2020-05-17 14:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As we reflect on the incredible legacy of Brown v. Board of Education, we’re reminded of the urgent work that remains before us 66 years later. We can’t rest until every kid gets a fair shot, and we finally live up to our founding ideals of liberty, justice, and equality for all.
1262096469785485318 2020-05-17 12:03:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> Moments of crisis require presidents to step up, transcend partisan politics, and unite the nation to achieve a common goal. But Donald Trump has done nothing but stoke division—and we're seeing the effect every day. He is the worst possible person to lead us through this crisis.
1262065345277255681 2020-05-17 10:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> No graduating class gets to choose the world into which they graduate, but few have ever entered at a point in this country's history where they genuinely have a chance to write a new chapter.  Congratulations to the class of 2020, I can't wait to see the future you create.  https://t.co/rfdhDJzBjO
1262042693489905664 2020-05-17 08:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Behind every COVID-19 death is a family and a community that will never be the same.  Behind every unemployment claim is a life thrown into uncertainty — a person wondering how they’ll make ends meet.  There is a real human toll to this crisis. We cannot forget that.
1262021805180506117 2020-05-17 07:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, on the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, I stand with LGBTQ+ people and their allies to celebrate and champion the inherent dignity and worth of all persons—regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. #IDAHOTB  https://t.co/olR352jHqu
1261865381075058689 2020-05-16 20:45:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congratulations to the Class of 2020 and to all those who were a part of the journey. I can't wait to see what you all accomplish. #GraduateTogether
1261808650454093824 2020-05-16 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> From this moment of crisis, we have the opportunity to not just rebuild our economy — but transform it.
1261794809565466624 2020-05-16 16:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day Donald Trump proves how wholly unfit he is to lead our country.  https://t.co/uxJOUnQ2Ok
1261760080422322176 2020-05-16 13:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who puts hardworking Americans ahead of the wealthy and well-connected.  https://t.co/S32PWWdLT3
1261729378171412481 2020-05-16 11:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Defeating Donald Trump is going to take everything we've got. His campaign has been preparing for the last four years and has millions in the bank. I know times are tough, but if you can, please pitch in today to help us catch up:  https://t.co/J626xObksn  https://t.co/6hXpIM3cF6
1261705973988839424 2020-05-16 10:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On this Armed Forces Day, @DrBiden and I want to express our gratitude and support for the men and women in uniform — serving and defending our country around the world. Thank you for your selfless service and sacrifice. You continue to make us proud.  https://t.co/CHDdzrZkhK
1261674293458604038 2020-05-16 08:06:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> It seems the way to get fired by President Trump is not to commit wrongdoing, but to investigate it.
1261665206184312838 2020-05-16 07:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Science over fiction.
1261450037739106304 2020-05-15 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The fact is Donald Trump wasted an awful lot of time, and lives were lost as a consequence.  https://t.co/c6UdsDmLWi
1261436978232356864 2020-05-15 16:23:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> I want Donald Trump to look the American people in the eye and explain why their hard-earned dollars are bailing out his wealthy donors.
1261416063784402946 2020-05-15 15:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're building a campaign that will defeat Donald Trump and transform this nation — but we need your help to do it. Join us this Sunday for a Grassroots Strategy Summit, where we'll lay out our path to victory and how you can get involved:  https://t.co/FhQWfR6nJf  https://t.co/VuEkunPtr2
1261408054093860865 2020-05-15 14:28:10 -0800 <JoeBiden> Unions like @GoIUPAT are supporting their workers and communities during this pandemic. To build a stronger, more inclusive, and more resilient middle class after this crisis, we must encourage unionization. That starts with enacting the PRO Act.  https://t.co/JbZbXnGHfx
1261404739109113856 2020-05-15 14:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Los fracasos internacionales de Trump han abierto el camino para que Cuba se una al Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU. Esto traiciona a los presos políticos en Cuba y mina aún más la diplomacia de los EE.UU. Como presidente, defenderé los derechos humanos del pueblo cubano.
1261403984100818944 2020-05-15 14:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump's international failures have cleared a path for Cuba to join the UN Human Rights Council. This would betray Cuba's political prisoners and further undermine U.S. diplomacy. As President, I will lead by empowering the Cuban people and defending human rights.
1261384606433058816 2020-05-15 12:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To everyone who has lost a loved one due to COVID-19: I know it's incredibly difficult right now, but there will come a time when their memory brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye. It will take time, but that’s when you know you’re going to make it.  https://t.co/bGyr3AIbWH
1261356924370423811 2020-05-15 11:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If you’re looking for ways to show off your support for the campaign or to stay entertained while we’re social distancing, we’ve got you covered.

1261324208577015810 2020-05-15 08:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have the power to create the future we want. A future where:  - We end our gun violence epidemic - We lead the world in combating climate change - Everyone has access to the health care they need - Our government works for all — not just the wealthy and well-connected
1261301559213715457 2020-05-15 07:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To all of our front line workers who are working day in and day out to keep our nation afloat during this crisis, thank you.
1261098722852777984 2020-05-14 17:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are months into this crisis. There is simply no excuse for President Trump's failure to implement a national testing strategy.
1261090619285540864 2020-05-14 17:26:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight, @StaceyAbrams and I will be joining @Lawrence for a discussion on combating COVID-19 and how we can ensure everyone can make their voice heard this November.  Tune in to @MSNBC at 10 PM ET to watch live.
1261077076465115141 2020-05-14 16:32:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> What he said.
1261070033905577985 2020-05-14 16:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump can deflect and shift blame all he wants, but the hard truth is he failed to protect our nation from the worst public health and economic crisis in our lifetime.  https://t.co/5kHQnJrK2a
1261061226886574081 2020-05-14 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Sherian, a small business owner from South Carolina, recently asked how I would help businesses like hers recover from this crisis and how we can tackle health care disparities among communities of color. They're important questions. Here's what I said:  https://t.co/5gfIxhmIoG
1261034759758675972 2020-05-14 13:44:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> The lives of tens of millions of Americans have been thrown into chaos through no fault of their own — and Donald Trump simply isn't doing enough to help them.
1261018512920731648 2020-05-14 12:40:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> Join me for a virtual roundtable on COVID-19 with Governors Gretchen Whitmer, Phil Murphy and Ned Lamont who are at the forefront of this crisis:  https://t.co/qMB1AT6ST1
1261013914025750528 2020-05-14 12:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Small businesses are the backbone of this country. We have to do so much more to support them through this crisis. Here's what I would do if I were president:  https://t.co/bXq5WtrytM
1260986986820599812 2020-05-14 10:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> With the void of leadership in the White House, governors across the country have stepped up to meet this moment. This afternoon, I’ll be joined by a few of them for a roundtable discussion on COVID-19.   Tune in at 3:30 PM ET to watch:  https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq  https://t.co/1EONVfE0pk
1260968615450271744 2020-05-14 09:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As the economy continues to spiral downwards and unemployment soars to Great Depression-era levels, we cannot ignore the hard truth: This crisis hit us harder and will take longer to recover from because of Donald Trump’s failures.  https://t.co/PYVWy6yG2w
1260936654858137601 2020-05-14 07:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There's nothing that the American people cannot accomplish when we stand together — one nation, united in purpose.
1260764765556740098 2020-05-13 19:51:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> Happy Birthday to the one and only @StevieWonder.  https://t.co/AnjAnNiGxB
1260751685959417858 2020-05-13 19:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> “60 days into the coronavirus crisis, the White House does not have a plan, a framework, a philosophy, or a goal.”  Real presidents lead. Reality TV presidents don’t.  https://t.co/hn7GkkPv5Y
1260744136212140034 2020-05-13 18:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Not only does the Trump Administration want to take away health coverage for millions in the middle of a pandemic, but now they want to let people go hungry, too. Their cruelty truly knows no bounds.  https://t.co/12JpuMOXEH
1260733099652022273 2020-05-13 17:46:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> Moments of crisis require swift and decisive action from our leaders, but Donald Trump and his administration have done nothing but dither and delay. They have failed the American people on every single front.
1260717021840445452 2020-05-13 16:42:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> I would trust the guy who’s one of our nation's top public health experts, not the one who pondered injecting disinfectant into the body and looked directly at a solar eclipse.
1260701573765836805 2020-05-13 15:40:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> Enough with the anger and division and fear-mongering, Mr. President. It's time for you to step up, appeal to our better angels, and unite the country. We'll overcome this crisis by coming together — not by tearing each other apart.
1260664864269381635 2020-05-13 13:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It didn’t have to be this bad. Donald Trump utterly failed to prepare for this pandemic and delayed in taking the necessary steps to safeguard our nation against the near-worst-case-economic scenario we are now living.  https://t.co/oFOuf4GbeB
1260639698529193986 2020-05-13 11:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We owe so much to every single worker on the front lines of this crisis. The least we can do is provide them the pay and protection they need and deserve. Here's what I would do if I were president:  https://t.co/DBDyKVHt1m
1260623340219387908 2020-05-13 10:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I joined @PeterHamby on @Snapchat’s Good Luck America to discuss everything from memes to stimulus oversight. Head to  https://t.co/JKWnILB7To to watch the interview today, Thursday, and Friday.
1260607989070786560 2020-05-13 09:29:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A united party is key to winning the White House this November. The work of the task forces will be essential to identifying ways to build on our progress and not simply turn the clock back to a time before Donald Trump — but transform our country.  https://t.co/Ps5dztgjrX
1260570499320446976 2020-05-13 07:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump can put up all of the banners he wants in the Rose Garden, but it doesn’t change the fact that he failed our nation when it comes to COVID-19 testing.  https://t.co/GDPuOAxndd
1260374201518526465 2020-05-12 18:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I wish the president would spend less time talking and tweeting and more time listening to experts like Dr. Fauci. This isn’t politics. This is life and death.  https://t.co/kJb8dYhf1B
1260355324357128195 2020-05-12 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@DrBiden and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Aimee Stephens. We send our deepest condolences to her wife, Donna, and her family. Aimee's spirit and courage will not only be her legacy but our guiding light as we carry on her fight for equality.  https://t.co/F9cAnGh6VC
1260339651509919746 2020-05-12 15:42:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Trump Administration clearly knows what's needed to make workplaces safe and operational: adequate testing, contact tracing, masks, and additional precautions.  They're putting in the work to keep themselves safe. Why aren't they doing the same for the American people?
1260303075111325697 2020-05-12 13:17:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is a bunch of malarkey and you know it, @senatemajldr. We left a 69-page playbook on how to fight pandemics.  You can read it here if you’d like:  https://t.co/zvRGv6ubWt  And make sure to pass along your notes to President Trump. He could use them.
1260294171618836480 2020-05-12 12:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump knew about this crisis all the way back in January — and his response since has been incompetent at best.  https://t.co/OgVj8ia8Lk
1260267215921844225 2020-05-12 10:54:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> That’s the plan.   https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M
1260225720435032065 2020-05-12 08:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here's the deal: We can choose who our country works for. We can choose whether it works for just the wealthy — or everyone else as well.  That’s the choice we must make — all of us together — this November.
1260155255880323074 2020-05-12 03:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be clear: My Administration will review every single stimulus loan given to big companies and political insiders. We will find any dollar taken corruptly, we will come get it, and we will punish the wrongdoers.  https://t.co/UVQILUeTVN
1260011558899499010 2020-05-11 17:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe everyone deserves a fair shot at success — not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd.
1259986650446344196 2020-05-11 16:20:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump just doesn't understand: We have an economic crisis because we have a public health crisis — and we have a public health crisis because he failed to act.  https://t.co/hRrueGgx2C
1259972803660443648 2020-05-11 15:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In April, we raised $60.5 million between my campaign and @TheDemocrats. I'm humbled and know what a sacrifice it is to give in times as difficult as these. But May is our most important month yet, and we need your help. If you can, please chip in today:  https://t.co/HbZYJWVJUs
1259943863621267457 2020-05-11 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump and his team seem to understand how critical testing is to their own safety. So why are they insisting that it’s unnecessary for the American people?
1259917439132819456 2020-05-11 11:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> With folks staying at home during this time of social distancing, we put together some fun activities to keep everyone entertained. Text FREE to 30330 to be the first to get a look at what we’ve been working on.  https://t.co/7dDXj3dPCm
1259896551805157378 2020-05-11 10:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump hopes to split us into dueling camps, casting Democrats as doomsayers hoping to keep America grounded and Republicans as freedom fighters trying to liberate the economy.  It’s a childish tactic—and a false choice none of us should fall for.  https://t.co/Kr8CYerAT3
1259855842041565186 2020-05-11 07:40:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> I have a better idea: give people coronavirus economic relief and don't hold their hard-earned benefits hostage.
1259834391670423553 2020-05-11 06:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This crisis presents an opportunity to not just rebuild our economy — but transform it. @AndrewYang joined me to discuss how we can do that and create a stronger, fairer, more inclusive middle class.  Listen to the full episode:  https://t.co/lQ9ghwJVgt  https://t.co/3GaBdN1S46
1259650681260044293 2020-05-10 18:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No podemos callar ante la violencia contra personas transgénero de color, como las recientes tragedias en Missouri y Puerto Rico. Es nuestra obligación garantizar que todos puedan vivir abiertamente, con orgullo y sin miedo.  https://t.co/CPmqT4kYxe
1259649424436785152 2020-05-10 18:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We cannot be silent in the face of rising violence against transgender people of color—like the recent tragedies in Missouri and Puerto Rico. It's our moral obligation to end this epidemic, and ensure everyone can live open and proud and free from fear.  https://t.co/CPmqT4kYxe
1259626773605564416 2020-05-10 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@AndrewYang and I covered a lot of ground on the next episode of Here's the Deal, but the most surprising part might have been learning about his connection to the Roosevelts.  Make sure to tune in for the full episode tomorrow morning:  https://t.co/gfVHzRcDXo  https://t.co/oYcWnZXWM8
1259615448905199621 2020-05-10 15:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Don't let anyone tell you differently: We have the power to write the future we want for our country.
1259581475109744640 2020-05-10 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tax cuts for the super-wealthy. Bailouts for large corporations. Working Americans left behind.  That’s Donald Trump’s record.  https://t.co/5ThHy2Gqdx
1259556785893052418 2020-05-10 11:51:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe rebuilding the middle class is the moral obligation of our time. We have to build a stronger, more inclusive, more resilient middle class — one that can withstand the next public health crisis or whatever else comes our way.
1259532401832837121 2020-05-10 10:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ordinary people, given half a chance, have never let their country down.  That’s who I believe in. That’s who I’m in this race to fight for.
1259506732759310336 2020-05-10 08:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To the extraordinary mothers everywhere, like Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, my wishes for a safe and happy Mother’s Day.  https://t.co/3PmotUx6EU
1259284518361600003 2020-05-09 17:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There's a clear choice this November:  Donald Trump will do everything he can to terminate health care for millions in a global pandemic.  I will do everything I can to ensure every American has access to the quality, affordable care they need.  https://t.co/ziqbBhFmzU
1259269922149916672 2020-05-09 16:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There’s no quit in America. None at all. We’re going to get through this — and we're going to come out stronger.
1259242159124946944 2020-05-09 15:01:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is inexcusable.
1259228398615846913 2020-05-09 14:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No one should pay a dollar out of pocket for coronavirus testing or treatment. Period.  https://t.co/HTc0fF1Ydi
1259198199731908609 2020-05-09 12:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Imagine what we could be doing now with the $2 trillion in tax cuts that Donald Trump delivered for his rich friends.  https://t.co/5yDjitm4l2
1259163471029166087 2020-05-09 09:49:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we're going to bring everyone along.  We have to make sure every single person gets a fair shot at success.
1259132265361100801 2020-05-09 07:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Crisis reveals character — and character belongs in the White House.  https://t.co/5XD4rtjNDL
1258959294269214722 2020-05-08 20:17:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ahmaud Arbery was shot down in cold blood. His family deserves justice — and they deserve it now.  https://t.co/YkXBvYIJNw
1258908289334640644 2020-05-08 16:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Make no mistake: COVID-19 has caused a massive economic challenge. But this crisis hit us harder, and will last longer, because Donald Trump spent the last three years undermining the core pillars of our economic strength.  https://t.co/4nkrpNDXgs
1258886898329812998 2020-05-08 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Two years ago, Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran Deal. This week, he vetoed a war powers resolution that would've prevented him from starting a war with Iran without Congressional consent. His decisions have increased the risk of war in the Middle East.  https://t.co/Tq0CU99A1r
1258874315518300162 2020-05-08 14:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Corruption is a feature of Donald Trump's economic agenda—not a bug. He will pick his wealthy friends and corporate cronies over working families every time.  I say it’s time we pick a different way—one where everyone gets a fair shot at success, not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd.  https://t.co/9MbZpSblC5
1258864250002513922 2020-05-08 14:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 75 years ago on #VEDay, America and its allies defeated fascism in Europe. From the devastation of war, we built a lasting peace. Today, as we honor the veterans who sacrificed for us, let us remember the importance of uniting against common threats.
1258853929036775428 2020-05-08 13:18:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> It didn’t have to be this bad. The hard truth is that Donald Trump was simply not up to the job.
1258835057101410310 2020-05-08 12:04:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m the proud husband of a teacher who inspires me every day. I’ve seen firsthand how hard teachers work with little support and few resources. Thank you to all the amazing teachers who've inspired and educated the future of our country. #TeacherAppreciationWeek  https://t.co/1sq1isIOWr
1258817692448051200 2020-05-08 10:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Wouldn't it be nice to have a president who listens to someone other than himself?  https://t.co/IN2Wtpacc4
1258784976834887689 2020-05-08 08:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump loves to crow about what a great economy he built.  This crisis has revealed what a failure Trumponomics has been. And American workers and families are paying the price.   Tune in for my remarks live on @nowthisnews at 12 PM EDT.
1258770883969077249 2020-05-08 07:49:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here's the simple truth: The United States of America has never been defeated when we're together — and we're not going to be defeated now.  We can and will overcome this.
1258583650150477830 2020-05-07 19:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I can't hit the campaign trail in-person due to COVID-19 — so instead, I’m traveling across the country from my home in Delaware. Head over to my Instagram to catch up on today’s trip to Florida 📲.
1258541860257058817 2020-05-07 16:38:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> Where are the tests, Mr. President?
1258527300540182531 2020-05-07 15:41:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every step of the way, President Trump has ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and misled the American people — and we’re all paying the price every single day.  I promise you, I will do the opposite.
1258453039901368326 2020-05-07 10:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Over 33 million Americans have filed unemployment claims since mid-March — one out of every five workers. It’s a national economic disaster that requires urgent action. We have to get help to everyone who needs it — efficiently, equitably, and immediately.  https://t.co/6wOUCo8Dj8
1258431648732872706 2020-05-07 09:21:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Real presidents lead. Reality TV presidents don’t.  https://t.co/2lMwnRXLcG
1258426367215050755 2020-05-07 09:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe the moral obligation of our time is to rebuild our economy in a way that finally brings everyone along. A Biden Administration will encourage the economic empowerment of African Americans and close the racial wealth and income gaps.  Read more:  https://t.co/Ni1rAmqfcz
1258398681537089537 2020-05-07 07:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> These folks are true heroes — every single one of them.  Take a minute to read their stories:  https://t.co/BU2eCifWhZ
1258199619722502147 2020-05-06 17:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can't host any in-person events due to COVID-19, but that won't stop me from hitting the campaign trail—virtually, of course. Tomorrow, I'll be making stops around Florida and wrapping up the day with a virtual rally in Tampa.  Tune in at 5:15 PM ET:  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50  https://t.co/H3ZAyxhxxj
1258184774486642688 2020-05-06 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: No one is expendable. No life is worth losing to add one more point to the Dow.
1258161115944681478 2020-05-06 15:26:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The nurses on the front lines of this crisis are American heroes. We owe them more than we could ever repay, but we can start by ensuring they have the protective equipment they need to stay safe, emergency paid sick leave, and premium pay. #NationalNursesDay
1258142107103092736 2020-05-06 14:10:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> You heard it straight from the president himself: He wants to terminate health care for millions of Americans in the middle of a global pandemic.  We can't let that happen.
1258110532953006080 2020-05-06 12:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The stakes in this election have never been higher. Over the last few months, we've seen how wholly unfit Donald Trump is to lead our nation.  We have to vote him out of the White House this November.
1258095433886375940 2020-05-06 11:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t sit by as Donald Trump and Republicans use COVID-19 as an excuse to disenfranchise voters. We need to ensure people have the opportunity to vote by mail, early vote, vote absentee and, in every way possible, safely vote in person this November.  https://t.co/uKRyR3LVTA
1258063979412250628 2020-05-06 09:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump-backed lawsuit to dismantle the ACA enters a new phase. If Trump and Republican AGs succeed, it’ll mean devastation for our health care system that will cause untold pain and suffering. We can't let that happen.  https://t.co/TVb3TIKsny
1258033779513253888 2020-05-06 07:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> These stories are heartbreaking and remind us that the numbers we see in the news are more than just statistics. Every death is a tragedy and marks a family and community that will never be the same. @DrBiden and I are keeping them all in our prayers.   https://t.co/ajYHuY6VN2
1257876833581912065 2020-05-05 20:36:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> The video is clear: Ahmaud Arbery was killed in cold blood. My heart goes out to his family, who deserve justice and deserve it now. It is time for a swift, full, and transparent investigation into his murder.
1257841258354970624 2020-05-05 18:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This didn't have to happen. The Trump Administration failed to take action and produce desperately needed protective equipment — and those on the front lines of this crisis paid the price. It's heartbreaking.  https://t.co/7bOj3POJCT
1257827550216302593 2020-05-05 17:20:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Biden Administration will not silence scientists.
1257818848591351809 2020-05-05 16:45:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> The choice between the economy and public health is a false one—if we don’t beat the virus, we'll never get back to full economic strength and will lose countless lives. We have to get the number of new cases down and scale up testing before we return to some sense of normalcy.
1257795708339421186 2020-05-05 15:14:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s important to stay connected while we’re social distancing — but there’s always that one friend who doesn’t get the hint when it’s time to end the video chat.   Glad we don’t know anyone like that — right, @KeeganMKey?  https://t.co/AoDEYRTo8G
1257731791302979584 2020-05-05 11:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's been a big few weeks. President Obama, Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders, Senator Warren, and Speaker Pelosi all endorsed our campaign. Now, we need your help to keep the momentum going.  I know times are tough, but if you can, please chip in today:  https://t.co/D4S84E6v2Z
1257697813208674305 2020-05-05 08:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Each week, I get hundreds of letters from people across the country. Folks share their hopes, ideas, struggles, and concerns — and I try to respond to as many as I can. We're going to share a few of them with you in our new series: Sincerely, Joe.  https://t.co/HOHwdCcY1h
1257677680662765568 2020-05-05 07:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to all the:  Firefighters Paramedics Police officers Doctors Nurses Medical support staff Grocery and retail workers Meatpackers Delivery drivers Transit workers And everyone else on the front lines of this fight.  You truly are the heart and soul of this country.
1257474844008108034 2020-05-04 17:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be clear: Essential workers on the front lines of this crisis deserve premium pay, emergency paid sick leave, and protections that keep them safe.
1257457336551079939 2020-05-04 16:49:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> Across the country, folks are stepping up, taking care of their neighbors, and lending a hand to those in need. It's who we are. In times of crisis, we stand as one. And it makes me so proud to be an American.
1257424764097802240 2020-05-04 14:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, I’m releasing a new plan to achieve equity for the African American community and take us one step closer to making America what it ought to be. Read more:  https://t.co/ub49jLMI9M
1257403121363415040 2020-05-04 13:14:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Over 1 million cases of COVID-19. Almost 70,000 dead. What is upsetting President Trump? Tough questions from the press.  Cry me a river, Mr. President.  https://t.co/MbSZJ0UMel
1257365750479818753 2020-05-04 10:45:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Make no mistake: We can emerge from this crisis a stronger, better, and fairer nation. It’s within our power — we just need a president and an administration who are up for the task.
1257312776780996608 2020-05-04 07:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I've always believed that we've been at our best when we've acted as one America. This crisis is an opportunity for us to be that nation again. There's not a single thing we cannot accomplish if we do it together.
1257097610135056390 2020-05-03 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. Donald Trump has not been that president.  https://t.co/QikZiHZeXX
1257077475605176326 2020-05-03 15:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The hard truth is that it didn’t have to be this bad. The lack of preparation, the slow response on testing, the failure to administer the relief in the CARES Act appropriately — all of it stems from Donald Trump’s failures as president.  https://t.co/d7XZvkJKXP
1257067640482226177 2020-05-03 15:00:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> This Sunday night, settle in and join labor leader Dolores Huerta, actor John Leguizamo, Secretary Hilda Solis, and Congresswoman Escobar for a #TodosConBiden discussion. Tune in now:  https://t.co/o7qCPrYivT
1257057343038033922 2020-05-03 14:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. We can and will overcome this — together.
1257038468699566089 2020-05-03 13:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump seems to think he can direct funding based on which politicians are nice to him, which states he’s trying to win in November, and which businesses he wants to enrich — all without any accountability. @EWarren and I think that’s unacceptable.  https://t.co/wbEcnkBzj1
1257021763390767110 2020-05-03 11:58:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> This #WorldPressFreedomDay, support for an independent press at home and around the world matters more than ever. We must vote Trump out this November and assure that attacks on our free press are never again acceptable — especially not in the White House.  https://t.co/Ga8zWYphOg
1257021762602184705 2020-05-03 11:58:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump deflects legitimate questions with attacks. He bullies members of the press, instead of taking responsibility for his failures. His efforts to undermine public confidence in the integrity of reporting violate our core values and threaten our very system of government.
1257021761872449542 2020-05-03 11:58:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> A free press is essential to a free society. That's why attacking the press and attempting to intimidate independent media is a standard part of the authoritarian playbook around the world. And it’s why Donald Trump’s efforts to demonize the media put us on such a dangerous path.
1256988891942252552 2020-05-03 09:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The U.S. Postal Service is an essential pillar of American life. We simply cannot let Donald Trump destroy it.  https://t.co/1W4W6LkMum
1256961717432733696 2020-05-03 08:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Over the last few weeks, I worked with our supporters and staff to create a code for our campaign—the principles we’ll live by, reflecting the community we’ve built, the team we aspire to be, and some of my own ‘rules’ as well.  I’m excited to share it:  https://t.co/odsoUFxPmd  https://t.co/ulwQwEosTz
1256727670554914818 2020-05-02 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This pandemic is bigger than any one individual or country. This moment requires all of us to come together — across the nation and around the world — to solve this crisis.
1256698438831476737 2020-05-02 14:33:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> When I say Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history, this is what I'm talking about.  Monty Bennett should return the tens of millions of dollars he received, and we should give it to the small businesses that need it.
1256667024912244736 2020-05-02 12:29:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> We left a playbook. He ignored it.  We created an office to prepare for pandemics. He gutted it.  We had CDC officials in China to detect and contain outbreaks. He pulled them out.  Trump can try and shift blame all he wants, but the fact is his actions left us unprepared.
1256653934837538816 2020-05-02 11:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mi corazón y el de Jill están con Puerto Rico a raíz de los terremotos de hoy. Mientras la isla enfrenta el impacto de este suceso y la pandemia del COVID-19 tenemos que asegurarnos que reciban los recursos y la asistencia que necesitan para recuperarse lo más pronto posible.
1256653431705497601 2020-05-02 11:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My heart and Jill's are with the people of Puerto Rico in the wake of another damaging earthquake. As the island grapples with both the impact of this earthquake and this pandemic, we need to ensure they get the resources and assistance needed to recover as soon as possible.
1256636638144446466 2020-05-02 10:28:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> To @USWNT: don’t give up this fight. This is not over yet.  To @USSoccer: equal pay, now. Or else when I'm president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding.
1256598066800611329 2020-05-02 07:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On March 6th, Donald Trump said: “Anybody that wants a test can get a test.”  It was a lie then, and it's still not true nearly two months later. It's a disgrace, and it's slowing efforts to reopen safely.  This administration needs to act immediately to surge testing nationwide.
1256373587784630278 2020-05-01 17:03:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When we come together and act as one America, there's not a single thing we cannot accomplish.
1256355216934547456 2020-05-01 15:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No one should have to pay for coronavirus treatment. Period.  https://t.co/GBchrVZmDz
1256306743585370112 2020-05-01 12:37:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'll say what Donald Trump won't: The Confederate flag, swastikas, and other symbols of hate that have been used in these protests have no place in America. The president should encourage folks to follow Gov. Whitmer’s public health orders — not sow further discord and division.
1256287268962254852 2020-05-01 11:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As we mark the beginning of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, @DrBiden and I extend our best wishes to AANHPI communities across America. We look forward to celebrating your extraordinary accomplishments and contributions in the month ahead.
1256282238393565184 2020-05-01 11:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When we emerge from this crisis, we can't just go back to the way things were before. We have to build a better future for all.  We can and will transform this nation — together.
1256240712036712453 2020-05-01 08:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This crisis isn't about you, Mr. President. It's about the American people.  https://t.co/3a4ppJ964Y
1256206136979738624 2020-05-01 05:57:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have lived long enough with a President who doesn’t think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. That’s not me. As a Presidential candidate, I’m accountable to the American people.  https://t.co/Wm1666LF8A
1256036868967280643 2020-04-30 18:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who listens.  https://t.co/pUFSMLd3pe
1256025544346517504 2020-04-30 18:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need more tests. Our front line workers need protective equipment. Americans need additional economic relief.  Yet the Trump Administration is spending time and energy on President Trump's wasteful border wall.  Unbelievable.  https://t.co/RY12LJAYGS
1256018159997464578 2020-04-30 17:30:39 -0800 <JoeBiden> The number is overwhelming, but each one represents a life thrown into uncertainty, a family unable to make ends meet, and a community worried about how it will recover.  We have to do more to help them. Now.
1256010445745344512 2020-04-30 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> - More than 60,000 people in the U.S. have died - 30 million have filed for unemployment - At least 1 million have gotten sick  Enough with the late night Twitter tantrums, Mr. President. It's time for you to step up and lead.
1255988550522351620 2020-04-30 15:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Instead of preparing our country to fight COVID-19, Donald Trump wasted months and promised it would miraculously go away by April.  He was wrong. And we're all paying the price.  https://t.co/R0tDbI1WZr
1255962665903697920 2020-04-30 13:50:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> An open and independent press is more important than ever in times like this. They deserve to be treated with respect — not belittled with schoolyard taunts from this president.
1255939345497849860 2020-04-30 12:17:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump either read his daily briefings and ignored the warnings, or didn't read them at all. Either way, it's a complete and unjustifiable dereliction of duty.
1255927332768034819 2020-04-30 11:29:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve been a big fan of Megan’s for years and can’t wait to join her this afternoon. You can watch our chat live at 2:45 PM ET:  https://t.co/RQzAg1XvVf
1255904752199536646 2020-04-30 10:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> We may be physically apart, but we are all in this together.  https://t.co/VNiMtbfItu
1255884615744516097 2020-04-30 08:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I promise you I'll honor all those we've lost from COVID-19.  https://t.co/9N00PTSNHw
1255863198156304385 2020-04-30 07:14:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> The climate emergency isn't just a threat to our environment, it's a threat to our health, economy, and so much more. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and take action to combat it before it's too late.
1255670706463006731 2020-04-29 18:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the middle of a global pandemic, the Trump Administration is still working to gut the Affordable Care Act and rip health care away from millions. It's morally reprehensible.  They need to drop the lawsuit immediately.  https://t.co/yc6azeqLVs
1255659381565214723 2020-04-29 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> With rent due in a few days and folks across the country worried they won't be able to make their payments, it's clear more needs to be done to provide relief. We need to freeze rent immediately for people who have lost their jobs and place a temporary ban on evictions.
1255647805118377985 2020-04-29 16:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The words of a president matter — and Donald Trump has used his to downplay COVID-19, pass blame onto others, and mislead the American people. I will do the opposite.  https://t.co/6ZViv3tdW7
1255636983793082370 2020-04-29 16:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Trump Admin failed to provide enough testing, PPE, and safety enforcement. Workers have gotten sick, plants have closed, and the meat supply is at risk. It's past time workers have the protections they need to stay healthy and do their job safely.  https://t.co/tD0Rc7P4mJ
1255609049867051015 2020-04-29 14:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> "I wish he were president right now, but I can't wait until he is if all of us do our part to support the kind of person that we want back in the White House." — @HillaryClinton  Join us:  https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW  https://t.co/xyy85Q0R6e
1255581619160784897 2020-04-29 12:36:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Wear a mask in public. Read your daily briefings. Listen to the experts.  This really isn't rocket science. It's common sense.
1255556201653219328 2020-04-29 10:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Throughout our history, we have emerged from every crisis stronger than before — and we will again.
1255528519670652928 2020-04-29 09:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We owe a profound debt of gratitude to the health care workers on the front lines of this fight. I checked in with Monica, an ICU Nurse, to talk about how she's getting through this and to thank her for all she's doing:  https://t.co/PLuEZWO5aQ
1255493286988406784 2020-04-29 06:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I couldn't agree with @HillaryClinton more. We need a president who will listen to the science, bring us together, and lead with compassion and heart. If I have the honor of being elected, that's the exact kind of president I will be.  https://t.co/g7z1C8SH7e
1255297119457607681 2020-04-28 17:45:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> There are nearly 330 million people in the United States — and according to the Trump White House, we've only conducted 5.4 million COVID-19 tests. It's abysmal.  Donald Trump needs to scale up testing, and he needs to do it immediately.
1255285668911230981 2020-04-28 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be very clear: No one is expendable.  We shouldn’t allow rationing of health care that discriminates based on age or disability.
1255253079798222848 2020-04-28 14:50:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> The fact is there has been so much unnecessary death in this country. If we had listened to the experts and heeded their warnings, it could have been stopped short. But Donald Trump failed to act — and now the American people are paying the price.  https://t.co/oXeANYvD7T
1255233827657654277 2020-04-28 13:34:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve known @HillaryClinton for years, and know that her dedication and passion for bettering our country are second to none. I’m grateful for her endorsement and for her friendship — and look forward to working alongside her to get Donald Trump out of the White House.  https://t.co/rv3BuW2BUx
1255211518167142400 2020-04-28 12:05:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> COVID-19 is affecting the entire nation, but the impact doesn’t look the same for everyone. I'm hosting a town hall on how COVID-19 is impacting women — and I'll be joined by special guest Hillary Clinton. Tune in now to watch:  https://t.co/sQBaHGHgRQ
1255183652943773697 2020-04-28 10:14:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> If you're excited too, join us at 3 PM ET:  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50
1255183480859824129 2020-04-28 10:13:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> (I'm with her.)
1255174436363268097 2020-04-28 09:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're months into this crisis and workers still don't have enough protective equipment, there still aren't enough tests, and the death toll continues to rise.  The President should spend less time congratulating himself and more time doing his job.  https://t.co/lVJAcHySwH
1255140965444182016 2020-04-28 07:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are months into this crisis, and health care workers still don’t have the protective equipment they need. It’s a national disgrace.  https://t.co/WnSdlPfJYR
1254940897130811393 2020-04-27 18:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tomorrow afternoon, I'll be hosting a town hall on how COVID-19 is impacting women — and I'll be joined by a special guest. Tune in at 3 PM ET to watch:  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50  https://t.co/nw44aea7UP
1254924567971274752 2020-04-27 17:05:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Trump Administration could have helped prevent this. But once again, they failed to take action — and now the American people are paying the price.
1254900631787245571 2020-04-27 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Testing is the springboard we need to help get our economy safely up and running again. Trump could rapidly scale it up. He hasn’t. Instead, he’s passed blame and pushed sole responsibility to governors.  We've got to do better.  https://t.co/qtjjC5shEJ
1254875960744255488 2020-04-27 13:51:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> COVID-19 is a danger to everyone. We will stop it by coming together as one America — not by targeting others.  Thank you for helping lead this fight, @AndrewYang.
1254857452656267264 2020-04-27 12:38:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> Join Senator Kamala Harris and Symone Sanders for a town hall addressing the impact and disparities of COVID-19 in the Black community. Tune in now:  https://t.co/coThZJGoej
1254806260324749315 2020-04-27 09:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> COVID-19 can hit anyone, anywhere — but it doesn’t affect every community equally. This afternoon, join Senator @KamalaHarris and @SymoneDSanders for a discussion on its disproportionate impact on communities of color.  Tune in at 3:30 PM ET:  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50  https://t.co/lzco7XHP53
1254782856074637319 2020-04-27 07:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We want our country to get moving and healthy again. But we must take the necessary, rational steps, grounded in science, to do so safely, so COVID-19 doesn’t come roaring back.  https://t.co/ivYeRgrf4q
1254756132746379266 2020-04-27 05:55:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm incredibly honored by @SpeakerPelosi's endorsement and grateful for her historic leadership in Congress.   Together, we helped pass Obamacare and together we can not only bring this country back from the brink from this current crisis, but transform it.
1254560894576623616 2020-04-26 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America has always met every big challenge with an even bigger solution — this moment should be no different. We need an infrastructure program that will combat climate change and create good-paying jobs at the same time.
1254538243996921856 2020-04-26 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Wealthy firms with ties to Trump got millions, while countless small businesses were turned away. No wonder he wanted no one to watch how the money was deployed.  The American people deserve rigorous oversight — and small businesses deserve relief. Now.  https://t.co/UNBLt4g5R9
1254518111430197250 2020-04-26 14:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The American people are stepping up and rising to meet this moment. It's time for our president to do the same.
1254496720454512641 2020-04-26 12:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction.  https://t.co/RmUuKLc70X
1254465766444789760 2020-04-26 10:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Imagine the future we can build with Donald Trump out of the White House. A future where:  - Health care is a right - We combat climate change - We end our gun violence epidemic - Our government works for all — not just the powerful  Let’s build that future, together.
1254429527700275200 2020-04-26 08:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The workers on the front lines of this crisis are risking their lives every day to combat COVID-19 and keep this country running. The least we can do is provide them the pay and protection they need and deserve.  https://t.co/cL67OThz8m
1254238015775363072 2020-04-25 19:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 366 days ago, we launched this campaign.  192 days from now, we’ll beat Donald Trump.  Let’s go win this thing, together.  https://t.co/yDbpcKgXwZ
1254197275242496006 2020-04-25 16:55:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> @carobrissett @pizzahut I bet this made their day. Thank you for stepping up and doing what you can to help those on the front lines of this fight.
1254196900011618304 2020-04-25 16:53:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> @Emmieinthecity Michelle, this is a great idea. Thank you for doing what you can to ensure folks have the masks they need to stay safe.
1254196649242628115 2020-04-25 16:52:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> @Im4fit Julie, I can’t thank you enough for all you’re doing to ensure folks have food and supplies during this crisis.
1254196014988361730 2020-04-25 16:50:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> @a_zinsner8 @TeamJoe This is great, Addie. Tell your mom and sister I say thank you for lending a helping hand to your neighbors.
1254195834029293571 2020-04-25 16:49:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> @AmandaLinton23 @templehospital Amanda, this is remarkable. Thank you for stepping up and supporting our front line heroes. I know the staff will greatly appreciate your donations.
1254183544772911104 2020-04-25 16:00:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, folks across the nation have showed their compassion by participating in our first ever #SOULSaturday.  Tune in now as we end the day with a celebration for our campaign’s one year anniversary:  https://t.co/69XYQrqkzx
1254179631151923205 2020-04-25 15:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> One year ago, we launched this campaign. Whether you were on #TeamJoe from day one or have joined in recent weeks — I’m incredibly grateful for your support and hope I make you proud. Together, we’re going to beat Donald Trump, unite this country, and transform our nation.
1254172771753627652 2020-04-25 15:17:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s stories like these that make me so proud to be an American and make me confident that we will overcome this. Because there’s nothing the American people have been unable to accomplish when we do it together.
1254172770830888960 2020-04-25 15:17:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> After seeing the shortage of masks around the country, Marilyn decided to step up and organize efforts in Northern Virginia to make homemade masks. Because of her selfless work, countless front line workers have the masks they need to stay safe.
1254172769882865670 2020-04-25 15:17:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> Older adults are especially vulnerable to COVID-19. Recognizing that, Erica decided to organize youth in her community to buy groceries for seniors — ensuring they receive the food they need while staying safe at home. She's a true hero.
1254172769065021441 2020-04-25 15:17:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> Brien usually works at the Ford Plant in Rawsonville, Michigan, driving a semi. But when the plant started assembling much-needed ventilators, he courageously stepped up and volunteered to help. His selfless actions will no doubt save countless lives.
1254172768192598016 2020-04-25 15:17:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> John, a Facilities Maintainer from Staten Island, recently contracted and survived the coronavirus. Shortly after he recovered, a colleague contracted the virus and needed plasma to battle it. John heroically stepped up and donated his plasma to help his coworker.
1254172767194316803 2020-04-25 15:17:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> Across the country, people are stepping up and doing incredible things amid this pandemic. It’s who we are as Americans—in times of crisis, we stand as one. For #SOULSaturday, I called a few folks to thank them for all they’re doing. Here are some of their stories:
1254154465420161026 2020-04-25 14:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight, we’re hosting a #SOULSaturday rally to celebrate the one-year anniversary of our campaign! Join us at 7 PM ET:  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50  https://t.co/3Bk3Dmml9e
1254124266444017666 2020-04-25 12:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We may be physically apart, but folks across the country are coming together to check in on their neighbors and thank our front line heroes. Use #SOULSaturday to show how you’re participating today.  https://t.co/2IXqofhlao
1254042684131627009 2020-04-25 06:40:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> When I announced my campaign one year ago today, I said we were in a battle for the soul of the nation.  One year later, that is as true as it has ever been. I believe we can and we will emerge from this crisis a stronger, better, and fairer nation. Together, as one America.  https://t.co/OpLWsvUc39
1253850965377036290 2020-04-24 17:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump needs to step up and do everything he can to give our front line workers the protective equipment they need.  https://t.co/pSTfvFlyQ7
1253836117666758657 2020-04-24 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know times are tough, but we have to campaign as hard as ever to take the strongest fight possible to Donald Trump. He has a lot more money than us, and we need your help to close the gap.  If you can, please chip in today:  https://t.co/W6pXlZBfdN
1253820752379490308 2020-04-24 15:58:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, to celebrate the one-year anniversary of our campaign, we'll be hosting a #SOULSaturday Rally tomorrow night! We may be physically apart, but I hope you'll join us in coming together at 7 PM ET:  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50  https://t.co/fA5ouDt4Ji
1253787817827799042 2020-04-24 13:48:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> The health of the American people is not a joke, Mr. President.
1253751812194070529 2020-04-24 11:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I can’t believe I have to say this, but please don’t drink bleach.
1253745522545917953 2020-04-24 11:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be clear: This crisis isn’t about you, Mr. President.  https://t.co/w6Ntdc5pEy
1253722368041607168 2020-04-24 09:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, we remember the atrocities faced by the Armenian people in the Metz Yeghern — the Armenian Genocide. If elected, I pledge to support a resolution recognizing the Armenian Genocide and will make universal human rights a top priority.  https://t.co/Afl5lMLPR3
1253715322592354304 2020-04-24 09:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No matter who you supported throughout the primary, I want you to know that you have a home in our campaign. You’re not just wanted — you’re needed. Together, we will beat Donald Trump and transform this nation.  Join us:  https://t.co/gnaFCAUzju  https://t.co/Yj1Ua9m8Aq
1253691562707558400 2020-04-24 07:25:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> These folks are American heroes.
1253489081239166980 2020-04-23 18:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know this is a dark time for so many people, just know that we will get through this. We will emerge from this crisis stronger than ever before.  https://t.co/42QY9zGvkk
1253484122749784064 2020-04-23 17:41:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> UV light? Injecting disinfectant?  Here’s an idea, Mr. President: more tests. Now. And protective equipment for actual medical professionals.
1253473981702774784 2020-04-23 17:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The words of a president matter — never more than in times of crisis. A president should seek to calm and heal, provide a steady hand, and a clear path forward.  Instead, this is what we get from Donald Trump:  https://t.co/0H5NTAqbY3
1253458882325667840 2020-04-23 16:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump will always put his wealthy and well-connected friends first — that should come as no surprise. But to allow the banks to do it on the backs of small business owners in the middle of a global pandemic is a new low — even for him.  https://t.co/tG1rVOeZxs
1253446047273062401 2020-04-23 15:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To celebrate the one-year anniversary of our campaign, we're hosting our first #SOULSaturday this weekend. Folks across the nation will be taking time to check-in on neighbors and thank those on the front lines of this fight.  I hope you'll join us:  https://t.co/45jVuvcaGf  https://t.co/U4WHSkzvSb
1253409557042229249 2020-04-23 12:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As Muslim families across America and around the world celebrate the beginning of Ramadan, @DrBiden and I want to extend our best wishes to all who are observing this holy month. Ramadan Mubarak.  https://t.co/mhKD5YSN85
1253383636264595456 2020-04-23 11:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Times of crisis often bring out our best. There are so many stories of good happening around the world amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Take a minute to read a few:  https://t.co/sbiSVrBXhW
1253346642478145536 2020-04-23 08:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 26 million people unemployed. That's not just a statistic  — every one is a life thrown into uncertainty. Every worker left wondering when they will next see a paycheck is part of this American crisis  —  and Donald Trump isn't doing enough for them.  https://t.co/fAzujTeMBI
1253144625151381504 2020-04-22 19:12:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> Unlike our current president, I will always choose science over fiction.
1253130216198639616 2020-04-22 18:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Make no mistake: The climate crisis poses an existential threat to our future. But I know the American people have the spirit, power, and ingenuity to meet the challenge head-on. There’s nothing we’ve been unable to accomplish when we do it together.
1253122666422169600 2020-04-22 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Workers, like grocery store cashiers, are on the front lines of this crisis risking their lives every day to combat COVID-19 and keep this country running. President Trump is refusing to do his job, but we've got to do ours. Learn more:  https://t.co/Cio6Bp8GYq #ShopSmart
1253111342392913920 2020-04-22 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our planet cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump.
1253096244311846912 2020-04-22 16:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have the power to change the future of our planet — and it starts at the ballot box this November.  https://t.co/9COHq8TRZ8
1253088692551348225 2020-04-22 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This #EarthDay, let’s recommit to doing everything in our power to combat climate change. That starts with voting Donald Trump out of the White House this November.
1253085894380322817 2020-04-22 15:18:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> @OfficialJLD Stranger things have happened.
1253068559997075457 2020-04-22 14:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Fifty years ago, #EarthDay began as a day of organizing that demonstrated the power of community action. This year, it’s also a reminder of everything that’s on the line if we do not get Donald Trump out of the White House.  https://t.co/IkZPE983fO
1253046162287849472 2020-04-22 12:41:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The climate emergency requires our urgent action. As president, I will:  - Ensure we achieve a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050 - Rejoin the #ParisAgreement and rally the world to go further - Make the largest-ever investment in clean energy
1253032141740367873 2020-04-22 11:45:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> Join me on Earth Day for a virtual town hall with special guest Al Gore — on one of the most pressing issues facing our country and the world. Tune in now:  https://t.co/7RNUMZcZ3g
1253013196644003842 2020-04-22 10:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Join me on #EarthDay for a virtual town hall — on one of the most pressing issues facing the world. Tune in at 2:30 PM ET:  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50  https://t.co/bfWur90iEw
1253006148954816514 2020-04-22 10:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Throughout my career, I've been committed to the fight against climate change. And on day one as president, I'll get to work taking the drastic action we need to address this crisis. #EarthDay  https://t.co/CTbTiwxI4Y
1252965380265439235 2020-04-22 07:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On #EarthDay, we're reminded that there is no more urgent crisis facing this nation, or the world, than the threat posed by climate change. We have to take drastic action before it’s too late — and that’s exactly what I will do as president.   https://t.co/FbsOsz7VzW  https://t.co/4KwlWtOibd
1252950280708055040 2020-04-22 06:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, we just launched a special #EarthDay episode of Here's the Deal! Governor @JayInslee joins me for a discussion on COVID-19, climate change, and why he's supporting our campaign.  Listen to the full episode now:  https://t.co/gfVHzRcDXo  https://t.co/DRJyrZ5njV
1252758013653528577 2020-04-21 17:36:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Trump Administration promised 27 million tests by the end of March.  As of now, only 4 million have been completed. It’s unacceptable.  We can’t safely reopen the economy without scaling up testing, and we can’t effectively scale up testing unless Donald Trump does his job.
1252747695741009920 2020-04-21 16:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Paycheck Protection Program was intended to send help to the small businesses that needed it most, but President Trump adopted an approach to help his high-priced friends. We've got to do better.  Here's what I would do if I were president:  https://t.co/NXMrGe56Pg
1252735364327813122 2020-04-21 16:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. We need to immediately expand vote-by-mail, online voter registration, and early voting to ensure everyone can safely exercise their right to participate in our electoral process.  https://t.co/An7O2h1t9M
1252692330865405953 2020-04-21 13:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know COVID-19 is causing many people to feel anxious about what the future holds or lonely during this time of social distancing — and that's okay, just know that you're not alone. I've asked my friend, Dr. Vivek Murthy, to share a few tips on how to get through this:  https://t.co/Hx9TMlF2zP
1252668423303299072 2020-04-21 11:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This Holocaust Remembrance Day, as we remember the millions of Jews who lost their lives at the hands of the Nazi regime, we recommit to ensuring such atrocities never again occur. With anti-Semitism on the rise, all of us must root out intolerance and give hate no safe harbor.
1252615575290802180 2020-04-21 08:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Out of every trial and tribulation, America has always emerged stronger — and we will again. We will not be defeated.
1252433068884811781 2020-04-20 20:04:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> I am honored to have the endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters, a leading environmental advocacy organization. Climate change is an existential threat, and there is no greater challenge and opportunity facing our country and our world.
1252425228803665920 2020-04-20 19:33:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> In March alone, this campaign raised $46.7 million, with 70% from online donations. This virus has changed our campaign. But it hasn't changed the unwavering support we've gotten from all of you. Together, we're going to defeat Trump. Help keep us going:  https://t.co/GIzEQS0nNj
1252389082723790850 2020-04-20 17:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The President needs to stop blaming others and do his job.
1252373596954955776 2020-04-20 16:08:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tune in now as @fred_guttenberg hosts a town hall on gun violence with #StudentsForBiden, 21 years after the Columbine High School massacre:  https://t.co/NG2kU7dpYp
1252360896850145280 2020-04-20 15:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No kid should fear for their life at school &amp; no parent should worry whether their kid will come home safe. Today, 21 years after the Columbine shooting, @fred_guttenberg will host a town hall with students on how we can end this epidemic. Tune in at 7 PM:  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50  https://t.co/BDwrDawWnJ
1252347558988525568 2020-04-20 14:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The office of the presidency comes with the ultimate responsibility for the biggest decisions in the world. Every great president throughout our history has met that duty with the leadership it demands. Donald Trump has not.  https://t.co/Dn9Gj50Dev
1252334221361848320 2020-04-20 13:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Like many families, we have had to find new ways to stay connected while we're physically apart. We've been video chatting with our grandchildren a lot and decided to record one to share with you all. Take a look:  https://t.co/1pGtQGcDhj
1252311481514962951 2020-04-20 12:01:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> On #SOULSaturday, folks will be doing everything from sewing masks and hosting food drives to writing letters to first responders and making calls to check in on neighbors. We are all in this together–and I hope you'll join us by signing up to take action:  https://t.co/rRADhp4Usl
1252311480315392003 2020-04-20 12:01:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> In times of crisis, Americans stand as one. We lend a hand to our neighbors and take care of those in need. It's who we are. In that spirit, and to celebrate the one-year anniversary of our campaign, we're hosting S.O.U.L. of the Nation Saturday this weekend.
1252280869739548673 2020-04-20 10:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to come together to make Donald Trump a one-term president. Once we do that, we will not only do the hard work of rebuilding this nation — we will transform it and create a better future for all.
1252235319526608905 2020-04-20 06:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On this week’s episode of Here’s the Deal, Senator @AmyKlobuchar joins me for a discussion on how COVID-19 has impacted her family and what drove her to get involved in politics.  Listen to the full episode at:  https://t.co/t11Fa0TZjc  https://t.co/YaLgMAQNff
1252032336159543297 2020-04-19 17:32:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> At a time when Trump is fanning the flames of white supremacy and hatred in our country, my heart is with the families of those we lost in the Oklahoma City bombing 25 years ago today. We must never give up the fight against these forces of hate and intolerance.
1252009937896640513 2020-04-19 16:03:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tune in to watch @SymoneDSanders and actor @TonyGoldwyn host a town hall on how COVID-19 has impacted workers in the entertainment industry:  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50
1251977258601975810 2020-04-19 13:53:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@DrBiden and I are keeping the loved ones of the more than 40,000 people in the U.S. we've lost due to COVID-19 in our prayers. This is a solemn day for our nation, and there will be more hard days ahead. But if we pull together, we will get through this. I promise.
1251968310087782400 2020-04-19 13:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight, @SymoneDSanders and actor @TonyGoldwyn will be hosting a town hall focused on how COVID-19 is impacting workers in the entertainment industry.  Tune in at 7 PM ET to watch:  https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq  https://t.co/VmSvAbIaon
1251947422483390470 2020-04-19 11:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To everyone working on the front lines of this crisis, thank you. We truly couldn't get through this without you.  https://t.co/vr10U5pca6
1251915965408980993 2020-04-19 09:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I can promise you that when I'm President, we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better. We'll listen to the experts and heed their advice. And I will always tell you the truth.
1251888534627082243 2020-04-19 08:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> At a time when studies are linking air pollution with COVID-19 mortality rates for the most vulnerable in our society, the Trump Administration is rolling back environmental protections — allowing more poison into our air.  https://t.co/047lsdtrQN
1251674691431018496 2020-04-18 17:51:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> As Kierkegaard said, “faith sees best in the dark.” I've always believed that. This pandemic is keeping many communities apart, but we've still got to keep the faith. Jill and I are wishing a Happy Easter to all of the Orthodox Christians celebrating around the world.
1251661920962326530 2020-04-18 17:00:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> The United States should be standing up for freedom and standing with the people of Hong Kong. Instead, Trump has said he's “standing with Xi Jinping.” That's weak. We need to be strong on values when it comes to China. That's what I'll do as president.
1251653085925179392 2020-04-18 16:25:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> I couldn't be prouder of my friends @LadyGaga and Chris Martin of @Coldplay for organizing the @GlblCtzn One World: #TogetherAtHome broadcast. We are all in this fight together — and if we stand as one, we will defeat COVID-19.
1251621524928253952 2020-04-18 14:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On Sunday night, @SymoneDSanders and actor @TonyGoldwyn will be hosting an unemployment town hall on how COVID-19 is impacting entertainment workers.   Tune in tomorrow at 7 PM ET to watch live:  https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq  https://t.co/NEMjeyisJx
1251593843188748288 2020-04-18 12:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We will not be defeated.  https://t.co/PSbYSIE4CM
1251582266251243525 2020-04-18 11:44:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump left our country unprepared and unprotected for the worst public health and economic crisis in our lifetime — and now we're paying the price.  https://t.co/aCxcqQqUqw
1251571445248843777 2020-04-18 11:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump says he’s a wartime president — it’s time for him to act like one.
1251518345548935169 2020-04-18 07:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump may not like it, but it's his responsibility to step up and lead our nation's testing strategy. Mass testing is key to reopening the economy and returning to some semblance of normalcy.  https://t.co/AYmwnMmDB4
1251298144089976832 2020-04-17 16:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump continues to do the exact thing we teach our kids not to do: blame others. It’s always somebody else's fault — never his. It’s unbelievable.  We deserve better from our commander in chief.  https://t.co/ZNEDGwozyu
1251274236808790017 2020-04-17 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19, but he is responsible for our slow, uncoordinated response.  Experts say that if we had acted two weeks earlier, more lives could have been saved.  Trump failed to take swift action—and we're paying the price.  https://t.co/nyq6DpLOid
1251224408959651840 2020-04-17 12:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump is trying to rewrite history when it comes to China and COVID-19 — but the facts don't back him up. Tony Blinken was the Deputy Secretary of State and is one of my top foreign policy advisors. He'll explain.  https://t.co/si3vDHnF2r
1251209309284859904 2020-04-17 11:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The uncomfortable truth is that Donald Trump left America exposed and vulnerable to this pandemic. He ignored the warnings of health experts and intelligence agencies and put his trust in China's leaders instead. Now, we're all paying the price.  Let me explain how we got here:  https://t.co/esvCaGki9V
1251186157024616449 2020-04-17 09:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know the American people will beat this. We’re brave and big-hearted. We’ve emerged stronger from every crisis that has tested us as a nation — and we will again.
1251148413699190790 2020-04-17 07:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re in the middle of a global pandemic. No one feeling ill should have to choose between earning a paycheck or staying home to recover. We need to provide paid sick leave to everyone who needs it immediately.
1250944564434735104 2020-04-16 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's been a big week: President Obama, Senator Sanders, and Senator Warren all endorsed our campaign — and we need your help to keep this momentum going.  I know times are tough, but if you're able, please chip in today:  https://t.co/xMh8n6xLAc
1250929465091338240 2020-04-16 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Together, we will defeat Donald Trump.  https://t.co/2nF0qVGGaH
1250916881801723904 2020-04-16 15:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today’s news that more than 22 million people filed unemployment claims over the last month is devastating. It’s clear more needs to be done to help hardworking Americans—so I’m calling for a bigger, bolder approach to keeping people on the job. Read more:  https://t.co/r65WXgLKLz
1250889199621832704 2020-04-16 13:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> These racist acts have got to stop. No one should be targeted for what they look like, where they or their ancestors come from, or who they are.  COVID-19 is a danger to everyone. We will stop it by coming together—not by targeting people of AAPI heritage.  https://t.co/y8vYAQzvsW
1250859000750583808 2020-04-16 11:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here's the simple truth: This nation has never been defeated when we're together — and we're not going to be defeated now. We will overcome this.  https://t.co/7Irkhnbf6I
1250831570031775745 2020-04-16 10:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When we emerge from this crisis, we can't just go back to the way things were. We need to build a better future for all.
1250789795246166017 2020-04-16 07:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To combat COVID-19, we need a decisive public health response to curb its spread and a comprehensive economic response that delivers real relief to Americans.  I've released several plans outlining exactly what I would do if I were president. Take a look:  https://t.co/YLHCGF1YM9
1250604607002337280 2020-04-15 18:59:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> When somebody is President of the United States, the responsibility is total.  https://t.co/hmhkBymGob
1250585971244044288 2020-04-15 17:45:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> So this week, we’re working through what ours will be. There are a few I know: compassion, kindness, humility, gratitude, and joy. But I want your help. Our supporters have been here from the start—and I want to know: what should be in our campaign’s code?  https://t.co/UoRbb41RHD
1250585970396794880 2020-04-15 17:45:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> We won’t defeat this President by being like him. We’ll win by doing the opposite. Where he seeks to divide us, we’ll connect people. Where he shows cruelty, we’ll show compassion. And when he fights, we’ll fight harder. But we can’t do it without you.
1250585969520259074 2020-04-15 17:45:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mayor @PeteButtigieg’s campaign had a set of “rules of the road” that helped define the character of his campaign and his supporters. I think it’s a good idea, and one I’d like @TeamJoe to adopt.
1250585968664600582 2020-04-15 17:45:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the Biden family, we have a code: My mom used to always tell me, “Joey, no one is better than you. Everyone is your equal, and everyone is equal to you.” I’m working on building one for our campaign, too.
1250554494657724417 2020-04-15 15:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Managing an economic relief and recovery effort is hard, painstaking work. The devil is in the details. It’s all about follow-through.  I've done the work before, and I'll be ready to do it on day one as president.  https://t.co/a7oCXZqCL2
1250518003751497728 2020-04-15 13:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are building the movement that will beat Donald Trump.  Join us:  https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW  https://t.co/pHIXCHZ0cm
1250501938048688128 2020-04-15 12:11:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> Millions of folks are relying on the workers at the front lines of this crisis. I’ll be talking to a few of them for our virtual town hall. Tune in:  https://t.co/r3HMc7MpJs
1250489062936346624 2020-04-15 11:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This afternoon, I’ll be hosting a virtual town hall with a few workers on the front lines of this crisis. Tune in at 3:00 PM ET to watch live:  https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq  https://t.co/koBtR3Ahq7
1250473963542593536 2020-04-15 10:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> COVID-19 is amplifying so many inequities in our society. We have to ensure support gets to those who need it immediately, and then do the necessary work to rip out the structural racism that creates these inequalities.  https://t.co/fDUcAdfOHz
1250431914080526337 2020-04-15 07:32:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in a battle for the soul of this nation and I’m proud to have the fiercest of fighters, Senator @EWarren, on my side. With her help, we’re going to beat Donald Trump and create a government that works for everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected. Let’s do this.
1250237970285723648 2020-04-14 18:42:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> From my basement to your sneaker room. Tune in Thursday at 11 PM ET on @SHODesusAndMero to watch!
1250227340145197056 2020-04-14 18:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I want Donald Trump to look these folks in the eye and explain to them why they or their loved ones haven’t been able to get tested for COVID-19. We’ve got to do better.  https://t.co/CUY6nmCPjl
1250202172727283712 2020-04-14 16:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s do this.  https://t.co/INkan0GxGL
1250192609550561280 2020-04-14 15:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Millions of people are relying on the workers on the front lines of this crisis. Tomorrow, I’ll be joined by a few of them for a virtual town hall.   Tune in tomorrow at 3PM ET:  https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq  https://t.co/KrSwKV84QT
1250173779227160576 2020-04-14 14:27:10 -0800 <JoeBiden> You have great taste, @SpeakerPelosi.
1250163243701723136 2020-04-14 13:45:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> Stories like this showcase exactly who we are as Americans. In times of crisis, we stand as one. We help out folks we've never met, lift each other up, and do our part to ensure we make it through.  We will overcome this, together.
1250143033066209283 2020-04-14 12:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Obama understands, as I do, that we will come through this crisis stronger. And then we’ll not only rebuild this nation — we will transform it.  https://t.co/nlilxxpA91
1250092980892991490 2020-04-14 09:06:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> Barack — This endorsement means the world to Jill and me. We’re going to build on the progress we made together, and there’s no one I’d rather have standing by my side.
1250064848106504193 2020-04-14 07:14:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> Leadership is about never proclaiming power. It’s about collaboration, it’s about coming together in a crisis and finding common ground. It’s about results.    That’s who I am and the role I aspire to fulfill in guiding this democratic nation to better times.
1250064846869221381 2020-04-14 07:14:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> I am not running for office to be King of America. I respect the Constitution. I’ve read the Constitution. I’ve sworn an oath to it many times. I respect the great job so many of this country’s governors — Democratic and Republican — are doing under these horrific circumstances.
1249899596995801089 2020-04-13 20:17:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> I want to congratulate @judgekarofsky on her hard-earned victory tonight. In the face of rampant voter suppression and GOP recklessness, the people of Wisconsin showed up and made their choice clear. I know Wisconsin will be a fairer, more just state with Jill on the court.
1249866208905580547 2020-04-13 18:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I am grateful to have the support of so many Wisconsinites and proud of the courage and commitment folks showed during last week's primary — but it should never have come to that.  No one should ever have to choose between their health and our democracy.  https://t.co/D4PpzYkter
1249842026985615360 2020-04-13 16:28:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> It shouldn't take a global pandemic shutting down schools to end school shootings.
1249820910434967553 2020-04-13 15:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> For months, the Trump Administration was repeatedly warned about the threat COVID-19 posed to our nation. They ignored the experts, failed to take action, and now Americans are paying the price.  https://t.co/YiSTQPnLNy
1249803348712263680 2020-04-13 13:55:13 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re in the middle of a global pandemic. We need a president who actually listens to public health experts.
1249778033818558465 2020-04-13 12:14:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> To Bernie’s supporters: I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country.   I hope you will join us. You are more than welcome on this campaign. You’re needed.  https://t.co/vJXlroCdDd
1249770830373978112 2020-04-13 11:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Unity.  https://t.co/cZxaRCY8jr
1249760560134213636 2020-04-13 11:05:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm speaking now about our nation's economic response to COVID -- and I'll have a special guest with me. Tune in:  https://t.co/VTJPX6da0v
1249753465879801856 2020-04-13 10:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, I hope you'll join my 2:00 PM Economic Response to COVID-19 remarks — I'll be joined by a special guest. Tune in at 2:00 PM to watch live!   https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq  https://t.co/KmSe2QvcQD
1249740850843844609 2020-04-13 09:46:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our U.S. Postal Service workers are at the front lines of this crisis. Millions of people are relying on them for things like medicine and other essentials.  And the President is trying to let them fail. Congress should do everything it can to prevent this.
1249724022281117696 2020-04-13 08:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tune in at 2:00 PM today for remarks on the urgent and dire need for a full economic response to COVID-19 at  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50.  https://t.co/fOhLzMVifQ
1249706406141292544 2020-04-13 07:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> For this episode of Here’s the Deal, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jon Meacham joined me to discuss presidential leadership and what it should look like in times of crisis.  You can listen to the full episode at  https://t.co/t11Fa0TZjc or wherever you get your podcasts.  https://t.co/tXjopC10xz
1249479913922613253 2020-04-12 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're facing a crisis unlike any we've faced before — and I couldn't be prouder of how the American people are responding.  https://t.co/wK1mDPDl9b
1249434614768132097 2020-04-12 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To everyone on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19, thank you. We truly couldn't get through this without you.
1249395607757873154 2020-04-12 10:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As we prepare to reopen America, we have to remember what this crisis has taught us: The administration’s failure to plan, to prepare, to honestly assess and communicate the threat to the nation led to catastrophic results. We cannot repeat those mistakes.  https://t.co/SkfH3U792L
1249380508477374465 2020-04-12 09:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, we just released a special Sunday episode of Here’s the Deal! @RevDrBarber joined me for a discussion on faith and its intersection with some of the most pressing issues we face as a nation.  Listen at  https://t.co/t11Fa0CorE or wherever you get your podcasts.  https://t.co/TJWyyWbVIC
1249364150482067459 2020-04-12 08:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This Easter, Jill and I wish all of you and your families a safe and joyful celebration, and we join our prayers with those of people from every faith for health, happiness, and a renewal of life in the year to come.  https://t.co/i3ID9G3qv7
1249125201536856066 2020-04-11 17:00:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in the middle of a global pandemic — and people need access to health care now more than ever. Donald Trump should reopen Obamacare enrollment immediately.
1249094876366503938 2020-04-11 15:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This new enemy may be unseen, but we have the tools, the expertise, the will, and the spirit to defeat it. There is nothing the American people can't accomplish if we work together.
1249064929182662656 2020-04-11 13:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need to help as many working families and small businesses as possible. Workers who have lost their jobs or seen their hours slashed and families who are struggling to pay rent and put food on the table need help immediately. There's no time to waste.  https://t.co/XFNZK6m1RV
1249034481698144256 2020-04-11 11:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are months into this crisis and our heroes on the front lines still don't have the protective equipment they need to stay safe. It's unconscionable.  Donald Trump needs to fully use the power of the Defense Production Act immediately.  https://t.co/wudATlE3wr
1249008054340739073 2020-04-11 09:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Now more than ever, we have to choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction.
1248981630905090052 2020-04-11 07:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump needs to do everything in his power to expand the number of testing sites and surge the number of tests. Mass testing is key to reopening the economy and finding a way out of this crisis.  https://t.co/WHprzHoGnm
1248762690467553280 2020-04-10 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. There's nothing we can't do if we do it together.
1248740039007309826 2020-04-10 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a global pandemic. We need to freeze rent for people who lose their jobs and place a ban on evictions immediately.  https://t.co/0sQYpUHosv
1248728965172396032 2020-04-10 14:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who demonstrates the leadership to address every aspect of this pandemic  —  including the spate of racist incidents targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders  —  with urgency and seriousness. Donald Trump is not that president.  https://t.co/4dvq4uiv17
1248716130677448709 2020-04-10 13:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The folks on the front lines of this crisis are American heroes.  https://t.co/ZBwPwiVTL9
1248685931604803584 2020-04-10 11:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> La historia de los EE.UU. es la historia de gente común que hace cosas extraordinarias. Sé que unidos, y como una nación, nosotros somos más fuertes que este virus. Sé que superaremos esto y seremos más fuertes por ello, se lo prometo. No pierdan la fe.  https://t.co/89o4gSMNWF
1248657242792046593 2020-04-10 10:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The health inequities being exposed by COVID-19 are unconscionable.  We can do better. We have to.  https://t.co/2T1hcOas9z
1248636858336022529 2020-04-10 08:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Whether you supported Bernie or any other candidate throughout the primary, know that there is a home for you in our campaign. You're not just welcome — you're needed. And I will do everything I can to earn your vote this November.
1248610434191679488 2020-04-10 06:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America’s story is one of ordinary people doing extraordinary things given half a chance. This virus is tough. But together and as a nation — we're tougher.  I know we’ll get through this and we’ll be stronger for it, I promise you. Keep the faith.  https://t.co/dC8JvRWPMC
1248405332755439616 2020-04-09 17:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The stakes in this election have never been higher. We have to come together and beat Donald Trump.
1248392750812155905 2020-04-09 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This virus can hit anyone — regardless of race, economic status, or access to power — but it doesn’t impact every community equally. It hits hardest those who are most vulnerable and who have the fewest resources.  We have to do better for all our people.  https://t.co/fx76CcIPdU
1248385231356219396 2020-04-09 16:00:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> The devastating unemployment numbers have made one thing even clearer: We need a fourth coronavirus relief package, and we need it fast. We need to take extraordinary steps to protect American families and ensure those laid off are made financially whole.
1248379915382059011 2020-04-09 15:39:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This morning's news of another rise in unemployment claims—on top of the millions already filed—is devastating. We have to make sure those affected get the benefits they deserve, but we can't stop there.  I'm announcing two new policies to help Americans get the relief they need:  https://t.co/fUlIB2Fra2
1248346736868970497 2020-04-09 13:27:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> I can't believe I have to say this, but we should be expanding the number of testing sites and surging the number of tests — not reducing them. Testing is key to finding a way out of this crisis.
1248332855257600006 2020-04-09 12:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to do more to ease the economic burden on working people. So today, I'm adopting two new policies to help deliver relief. As president, I will:  - Lower Medicare eligibility to age 60 - Forgive student debt for low-income and middle class families  https://t.co/wtMnhJdCaR
1248284537165152266 2020-04-09 09:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be clear: No one should have to pay for their coronavirus treatment.
1248271953829310464 2020-04-09 08:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Eleven-year-old Isaac Johnston asked me what else kids should be doing in addition to washing their hands and staying home. My advice was simple:  - Stay a safe distance from friends - Sneeze into your elbow - And eat your vegetables  https://t.co/ksPS4Xb7Wm
1248257318141267968 2020-04-09 07:31:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> A total of about 17 million people have filed for unemployment over the last three weeks. This is unprecedented.   The economic devastation that families all across this country are experiencing is not their fault. We've got to take extraordinary steps to protect them.
1248050494574133251 2020-04-08 17:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're seeing the soul of our nation on full display every day in this crisis — and it makes me so proud to be an American.  https://t.co/PERwpmeL2X
1248038163429425154 2020-04-08 17:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we come together, we will defeat Donald Trump. And when we do that, we will not only do the hard work of rebuilding this nation — we will transform it.
1248019037386391552 2020-04-08 15:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This nation has never been defeated when we’re together. And we’re not going to be defeated now.
1248002658754945025 2020-04-08 14:39:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> Join our virtual town hall on unemployment and the issues currently facing working families across the nation. Tune in now:  https://t.co/hHG9sgNoka
1247990096957190146 2020-04-08 13:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The coronavirus is not Donald Trump's fault, but the slow and chaotic response to it is. He's the commander in chief — it's time he steps up, takes responsibility, and does his job.  https://t.co/UFM5lPyzU3
1247969965346521088 2020-04-08 12:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The primary is over, but we're just getting started. We're building a campaign to defeat Donald Trump and ensure that America finally lives up to our founding promises — but we can't do it without your help.  If you're with us, chip in today:  https://t.co/bEBrI6DSqs
1247951089581817862 2020-04-08 11:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the wake of COVID-19, working families across the country are facing a whole new set of challenges. This afternoon, I'll be hosting a town hall to listen to folks' concerns and discuss what we should be doing to deliver relief.  Tune in at 5:30 PM ET:  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50  https://t.co/Xzgoj0E4vB
1247920861090394112 2020-04-08 09:14:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> Together we will defeat Donald Trump. But we will also address the climate crisis. We will make college affordable. And we will make health care available to all.  We will not just rebuild this nation – we’ll transform it. And I’m asking you to join me.  https://t.co/vJXlroCdDd
1247920858443714562 2020-04-08 09:14:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> And to Bernie’s supporters: I know that I need to earn your votes. And I know that might take time. But I want you to know that I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of this moment. I hope you'll join us. You're more than welcome: You're needed.
1247920854903767045 2020-04-08 09:14:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> We know how hard this is. You have put the interest of the nation – and the need to defeat Donald Trump – above all else. And for that we’re grateful. But we want you to know: we’ll be reaching out. You’ll be heard by me. As you say: Not me, Us.
1247920853410615296 2020-04-08 09:14:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> To Bernie and Jane, as friends, from Jill and me: You haven’t just run a political campaign; you’ve created a movement. And make no mistake about it, we believe it’s a movement that is as powerful today as it was yesterday. That’s a good thing for our nation and our future.
1247920466603528193 2020-04-08 09:13:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know Bernie well. He’s a good man, a great leader, and one of the most powerful voices for change in our country. And it’s hard to sum up his contributions to our politics in one, single tweet. So I won’t try to.  https://t.co/Z6OkCDWFNm
1247898241569411075 2020-04-08 07:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As Jewish families across America and around the world prepare to observe the first night of Passover, Jill and I want to say chag sameach, and offer our very best wishes, to all who are celebrating.  https://t.co/Qg5Wa9ftyT
1247891970912993280 2020-04-08 07:20:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> It is a national disgrace that our health care workers still don't have the protective equipment they need. Donald Trump needs to fully use the power of the Defense Production Act to deliver these life-saving supplies.
1247699431442370561 2020-04-07 18:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re starting to see evidence that long-term exposure to air pollution—which disproportionately affects communities of color &amp; low-income communities—is linked to COVID-19 death rates. It's past time we treat pollution like the threat to our health it is.  https://t.co/3GD15s3xSy
1247681815218753538 2020-04-07 17:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The weeks ahead will be some of the toughest we’ve ever experienced as a nation. We need to face them with the same spirit and resolve that have guided us through previous crises. Because out of every trial and tribulation, America has always emerged stronger — and we will again.
1247676278938853376 2020-04-07 17:03:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, I know these are tough times, but this crisis has made it clearer than ever how much elections matter — and what a difference it makes who is in the White House. If you can, please chip in to fuel our campaign. I would really appreciate it.   https://t.co/mZbSSmDbN2
1247659115683479555 2020-04-07 15:54:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> @blackenterprise Jill and I send our heartfelt condolences to the entire Graves family. As the founder of Black Enterprise, Earl Graves Sr. was a trailblazer in his own right, a leader in the American business community, and paved the way for many Black entrepreneurs to realize their dreams.
1247654894187790337 2020-04-07 15:38:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> On #WorldHealthDay, we thank the tireless health care workers fighting COVID-19, and we see clearly why protecting the health of Americans requires U.S. global leadership—to coordinate an international response, strengthen health systems everywhere, and prevent the next pandemic.
1247626527489044481 2020-04-07 13:45:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> Secretary Modly's resignation is appropriate and called for. His disparaging remarks were far beneath the dignity of the office he held. Our sailors, our nation, and Captain Crozier deserve better.
1247540886885543936 2020-04-07 08:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> What do Fig Newtons and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches have in common? Listen to this preview of this week's podcast to find out — and then check out the full episode at  https://t.co/t11Fa0CorE or wherever you get your podcasts.  https://t.co/AfL018UA4h
1247479234290999296 2020-04-07 04:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congressman John Lewis is a moral giant who has spent his entire life pushing our nation to live up to our highest ideals. I'm honored to call him a friend — and grateful to have him by my side in this battle for the soul of our nation.  https://t.co/kqwe6CGre1
1247312884306268160 2020-04-06 16:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're going to get through this. Together.  https://t.co/Te1Ep3RG2y
1247296778095005696 2020-04-06 15:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> For months, I called on President Trump to step up and take the action necessary to combat COVID-19.  But week after week, he downplayed the threat it posed, misled the American people, and failed to act.  Take a look:  https://t.co/IkkkdeRS8V
1247283692231245824 2020-04-06 15:03:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Judy, from itsJudysLife, asked an important question during our Family Town Hall on COVID-19: What extra precautions should expectant mothers be taking at this time?  Listen to what former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy had to say:  https://t.co/Z1el7lgoyJ
1247232309549555715 2020-04-06 11:38:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who actually listens to the experts and heeds their advice.
1247194938762297345 2020-04-06 09:10:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mr. President, I hope we can gather in Milwaukee, but that is going to depend on you stepping up and doing what needs to be done to handle this pandemic. I have laid out how you can do that:  https://t.co/YLHCGEKnUB. Happy to discuss anytime.
1247192340311220224 2020-04-06 09:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, our second episode of Here’s the Deal is live! This week, @GovWhitmer joins me for a discussion on COVID-19, President Trump’s personal attacks, and the importance of bipartisanship to deliver results.  Listen at  https://t.co/t11Fa0CorE or wherever you get your podcasts.
1247186048859295745 2020-04-06 08:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It is close to criminal the way they’re dealing with Captain Crozier. He spoke up to protect his sailors — he should have a commendation, not be fired.  https://t.co/ZnadEsljxX
1246942946684891136 2020-04-05 16:29:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> During our Family Town Hall on COVID-19, I was asked what we can do to prevent this from happening again. Here’s where I'd start:  https://t.co/A4M8u9W2SR
1246935396849598467 2020-04-05 15:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> During these uncertain times, getting the right information out there is so important.  Myself and @DrBiden had the opportunity to host a conversation about COVID-19 with 3 family vloggers: ItsJudysLife, J House Vlogs and The Curly Coopers. Tune in now:  https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq
1246927340782915587 2020-04-05 15:26:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> These health care workers — and all those on the front lines of this fight — are American heroes.
1246890352025444353 2020-04-05 13:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day that Donald Trump refuses to use the full power of the Defense Production Act further threatens American lives.
1246867701869490182 2020-04-05 11:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We all want to protect our families — the first step is arming ourselves with the facts.   @DrBiden and I hosted a town hall on COVID-19 with three family YouTubers: ItsJudysLife, J House Vlogs and The Curly Coopers. Tune in tonight at 7PM EDT:  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50  https://t.co/gIEPo2PjuO
1246839674724855810 2020-04-05 09:38:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are at war with this virus — and the health care workers on the front lines are our soldiers. It is unacceptable that they don’t have the lifesaving masks, gowns, and protective gear they need.
1246811329328893953 2020-04-05 07:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Out of every crisis, America has always emerged stronger — and we will again. We will not be defeated.  https://t.co/HLR9WBZBhR
1246585088529313798 2020-04-04 16:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump needs to reopen Obamacare enrollment immediately. This is no time to put pettiness and ideology above helping those who are in the greatest need.  Lives are at stake.  https://t.co/QbyOXboFbr
1246550611606138880 2020-04-04 14:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I had the pleasure of hosting a town hall with family vloggers ItsJudysLife, The Curly Coopers, and JHouse Vlogs where we answered their questions about the COVID-19 outbreak.  Tune in to the premiere on Sunday at 7PM ET:  https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq  https://t.co/9fqyYsGwMJ
1246524690668998656 2020-04-04 12:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he is responsible for failing to prepare our nation to respond to it.
1246496098614743040 2020-04-04 10:53:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> We owe so much to those working around the clock to keep our country running during this crisis. The least we can do is provide the pay, benefits, and protections they need and deserve.
1246486438733959169 2020-04-04 10:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a Supply Commander to step up and take charge and get the doctors, nurses, health care workers, first responders, firefighters, and cops the equipment they need to protect themselves and save lives.  https://t.co/3OgY1cRGlK
1246470080826871808 2020-04-04 09:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In January, while Donald Trump was downplaying COVID-19, I wrote an op-ed calling for immediate action to combat the growing threat.  In it, I also said Trump was the worst possible leader to deal with a public health crisis.  I stand by that statement.  https://t.co/PH4vF5taDa
1246446065550852096 2020-04-04 07:34:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> Throughout the campaign, I’ve talked a lot about the soul of our nation — we’re seeing that soul on full display. There’s so much good happening — people reaching out to one another, neighbors helping neighbors, caring for those in need. It makes me so proud to be an American.
1246225973797883904 2020-04-03 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My friend, @GabbyGiffords, knows what it takes to persevere in the face of uncertainty. Take a few minutes to read these powerful words from her on how we can get through this — together.  https://t.co/Kl0OrjB3UG
1246211524747722754 2020-04-03 16:02:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is a headline every American should see: “Trump administration ended pandemic early-warning program to detect coronaviruses”  Donald Trump’s shortsighted actions left our nation ill-prepared to deal with this outbreak.
1246180453465370624 2020-04-03 13:59:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Those are the kinds of questions Trump will be responsible for. He doesn’t have a great record when it comes to delivering on promises, but I hope this time is different.   Being president is about taking responsibility. The blame game won’t cut it. Too many lives are at stake.
1246180451863101441 2020-04-03 13:59:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> The CARES Act provides money to help working people—how do we make sure it gets to them as quickly as possible?   There’s money for major corporations—how do we make sure that there is rigorous oversight to ensure it is used to help workers and not enrich top executives?
1246180450923675652 2020-04-03 13:59:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve done this work before. It’s hard, painstaking work.   I was in charge of administering the $800 billion Recovery Act — so I understand that the devil is in the details. It’s about follow-through.
1246180449346621442 2020-04-03 13:59:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve put together a checklist for making the economic relief and recovery effort work for families, workers, and small businesses. I encourage President Trump to adopt any and all of the ideas.  https://t.co/P5gq7h2rtE
1246153998161215493 2020-04-03 12:14:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Families across the country are impacted by COVID-19—and it can be especially difficult to explain to children.   Jill and I spoke with ItsJudysLife, JHouseVlogs and The Curly Coopers to answer their questions about the crisis. Tune in on Sunday at 7PM ET:  https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq  https://t.co/TUQnhOroTU
1246128672844718080 2020-04-03 10:33:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> Captain Crozier was faithful to his duty—both to his sailors and his country. Navy leadership sent a chilling message about speaking truth to power. The poor judgment here belongs to the Trump Admin, not a courageous officer trying to protect his sailors.  https://t.co/AkGFdlYjwt
1246119929809641472 2020-04-03 09:58:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is another clear warning sign that more needs to be done to keep as many people on payroll as possible. Fast, bold action to bolster American workers now will save more pain later. Congress must get to work immediately on the next package. We can't afford to waste time.
1246106938104074242 2020-04-03 09:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Now more than ever, we need to choose hope over fear. We will beat COVID-19. We will overcome this. Together.
1246085043862339586 2020-04-03 07:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Wisconsin — you have until 5 PM CT tonight to request your mail-in absentee ballot ahead of next week’s primary. Head to  https://t.co/hkOfDswg34 to request yours today.  https://t.co/6Ldcy3QBT6
1245871134127443979 2020-04-02 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The evidence is clear: Donald Trump ignored the warnings. He failed to act. And now Americans are paying the price.  https://t.co/1qROBGtsSs
1245857293045911558 2020-04-02 16:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Real courage is confronting something that you're afraid to do and doing it anyway. That’s what people across this country are doing every single day in the face of this crisis. They are American heroes.  https://t.co/KQQiU9P8xz
1245824577516613636 2020-04-02 14:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In order for our government to work for all Americans, it's important it be representative of all Americans. With openly LGBTQ individuals only making up .17% of elected officials, we have work to do.  This National #OutToWin Day, I'm asking: Will you run?  https://t.co/QvM6IINN4T
1245806188731621377 2020-04-02 13:11:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm about to roll out my plan to make the economic recovery work. Tune in now:  https://t.co/fLTDvwK1wf
1245788730532810760 2020-04-02 12:02:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> My heart goes out to the millions of Americans who filed unemployment claims in recent weeks, and the millions more who worry what next week holds for them.  Donald Trump needs to take action to ensure Americans receive the economic relief they need as soon as possible.
1245773239390883846 2020-04-02 11:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know many folks are feeling anxious and worried. I just want you to know that you're not alone. Americans in every corner of the country are feeling the same exact way you are. We may be physically apart, but we are all in this together — and we will overcome this. I promise.
1245747570212823046 2020-04-02 09:19:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our health care workers on the front lines of this fight still don’t have the masks, gowns, and other protective equipment they need. It’s unacceptable.  Add your name to demand Donald Trump use his full authority to deliver these lifesaving supplies:  https://t.co/bnHqHEIp1T
1245727652255858690 2020-04-02 07:59:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> The economic damage from this public health crisis is both rising and deepening at an alarming rate. It is putting working families and the American middle class through unimaginable financial pain — and they need to be made whole as fast as possible.  https://t.co/QNuB29JcGy
1245512521219551232 2020-04-01 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's now April, and:  - States still don't have enough tests - Hospitals still don't have enough ventilators - Health care workers still don't have enough masks  Donald Trump needs to use all available authorities immediately to solve these shortages.
1245497925167448065 2020-04-01 16:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> At a time when Americans might need health care the most, the Trump Administration is preventing people who need insurance from getting it. Their cruelty truly knows no bounds.  https://t.co/PelIrNxBNQ
1245487355773030403 2020-04-01 16:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Amigos, ¡es el Día del Censo! Solo toma unos minutos completar el Censo, pero ayudará a determinar el futuro de su comunidad para la próxima década. Visite  https://t.co/fcbpzx0tJp para que lo cuenten hoy.
1245464668870770689 2020-04-01 14:34:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> This callous decision will cost lives. Period.
1245458163236823051 2020-04-01 14:09:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, it’s Census Day! The Census only takes a few minutes to complete but will help determine the future of your community for the next decade. Head to  https://t.co/fcbpzx0tJp to get counted today.
1245420917745790976 2020-04-01 11:41:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It is a national disgrace that our health care workers still don't have the protective equipment they need.
1245382665626202113 2020-04-01 09:09:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to the governors who are meeting this moment with decisive action, a steady hand, and compassionate leadership. Thank you for stepping up when President Trump has not.
1245348188623474688 2020-04-01 06:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The words of a president matter.  https://t.co/OteNK4CWbU
1245182821452349444 2020-03-31 19:54:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re in the middle of a global pandemic, and the Trump Administration is preventing people from getting health care.  I can’t believe this needs to be said, but President Trump needs to reopen Obamacare enrollment, and he needs to do it now. Lives are at stake.
1245141325240045571 2020-03-31 17:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hoy, al honrar la vida y el legado del activista César Chávez, también agradecemos a los más de 2 millones de trabajadores agrícolas que están en primera línea, trabajando para mantener a los estadounidenses alimentados y sanos durante esta pandemia.  https://t.co/MNl59g81OV
1245140067364089857 2020-03-31 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today as we honor the life and legacy of civil rights and labor movement activist, César Chávez, we also thank the more than 2 million farmworkers who are on the frontlines, working to keep Americans fed and healthy during this pandemic.  https://t.co/MNl59g81OV
1245128742499999745 2020-03-31 16:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight marks our biggest public end-of-quarter deadline of the campaign so far. I know times are tough, but what’s at stake in this election has never been clearer. If you could chip in to help us reach our goal, I would really appreciate it:  https://t.co/qRzUR2DdVI
1245112384865386504 2020-03-31 15:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's 2020 — it’s unacceptable that women still don’t get equal pay for equal work. Let’s close the gender pay gap and end #EqualPayDay once and for all.  https://t.co/GH6rASk0wH
1245093762079944704 2020-03-31 14:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the midst of a pandemic, the Trump Administration chose to expend effort to attempt to disestablish the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe’s reservation. #IStandwithMashpee and with all of Indian Country.  https://t.co/5Z6nZjClAf
1245080424063303681 2020-03-31 13:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today and every day, @DrBiden and I are proud to stand with the trans community. We see you, we support you, and we will continue to do everything we can to ensure you are affirmed and accepted just as you are. #TransDayOfVisibility
1245066582792884224 2020-03-31 12:13:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I would never send an American soldier anywhere in the world without the equipment and protection they need. We should not do any less for the heroes on the front lines of the battle we’re in now.  https://t.co/ZWNExlKq3H
1245033364148482050 2020-03-31 10:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm confident that the American people will meet this moment. There’s never been a challenge we've been unable to overcome if we do it together.
1245006688161165312 2020-03-31 08:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to place a temporary ban on evictions nationwide. No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a pandemic.
1244980264100605953 2020-03-31 06:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In order to combat COVID-19, we need both a decisive public health response and a decisive economic response. I’ve laid out exactly what I would do if I were president during this crisis, take a look:  https://t.co/Q58OQW6tQO
1244773904402563080 2020-03-30 16:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our health care workers are putting their lives on the line every day, and our president is accusing them of stealing lifesaving supplies. It's time for Donald Trump to do his job, so our heroes are able to do theirs. Lives are at stake.  https://t.co/qiwRjrVUYz
1244765096284479496 2020-03-30 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is unconscionable. Americans are already afraid of the impact the deadly COVID-19 pandemic is having on their lives — they don't need the added stress of losing their health insurance. Drop the lawsuit.  https://t.co/VyN90rluy9
1244742447126593536 2020-03-30 14:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know these are confusing and scary times, so for the first episode of our new podcast I sat down with Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, to help provide some clarity around COVID-19.  Listen at  https://t.co/gfVHzRcDXo or wherever you get your podcasts.  https://t.co/bCd1houIqo
1244723573002035206 2020-03-30 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The medical professionals on the front lines of this crisis are American heroes — risking their lives in order to save others. We owe them more than we could ever repay, but we can start by ensuring they have the protective equipment they need to stay safe. #NationalDoctorsDay
1244674499775258626 2020-03-30 10:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump should be using the Defense Production Act to get our first responders and health care providers the masks, gowns, and protective equipment they need. This is a matter of life and death.  https://t.co/i4jNeL7yoc
1244640527062097922 2020-03-30 08:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The American people are generous, decent, good, and fair. In times of crisis, we come together as one. We look out for our neighbors and lend a hand to those in need. We will get through this, together. I promise.
1244607055215726593 2020-03-30 05:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Not a joke, folks, we just launched our new podcast. It’s called "Here's the Deal." For our first episode, I sat down with Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, for a discussion on COVID-19.  Listen at  https://t.co/t11Fa0TZjc or wherever you get your podcasts.
1244455110488530944 2020-03-29 19:43:13 -0800 <JoeBiden> I am issuing this challenge to the President: in the next 48 hours, direct the production and distribution of respirator masks, gloves, protective face shields and gowns to fill every supply request made by a governor to the federal government.   Lives are at stake.
1244414536582598657 2020-03-29 17:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We will overcome this — together.
1244381820797489152 2020-03-29 14:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I will always choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction.
1244341587708203009 2020-03-29 12:12:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's hard to read this story and not conclude one thing: The Trump Administration failed the American people.
1244333195686039552 2020-03-29 11:38:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> Instacart needs to step up and give their workers the protections and pay they need and deserve. Now.
1244313924977209346 2020-03-29 10:22:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> Dreamers are Americans. We should never endanger or throw into question their ability to contribute to our nation, but to do so in a moment of national crisis is beyond misguided.  https://t.co/6n7kQbw6QH
1244276879424536576 2020-03-29 07:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The folks working to keep our country running are true heroes — and we need to ensure they have the protections, accommodations, and benefits they need and deserve. We couldn't get through this without them.  https://t.co/eErp14BkuK
1244049631886970881 2020-03-28 16:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump’s ego will cost lives.  https://t.co/JNcGny13KO
1244034532317302787 2020-03-28 15:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult, but it’s even harder when you’re not able to be with them in their final moments — and that’s what’s happening around the country because of the coronavirus. It’s heartbreaking, and I’m keeping everyone affected in my prayers.  https://t.co/vAISTRxi5O
1244006787273166848 2020-03-28 14:01:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Administration promised millions of tests by mid-March. But it's not happening fast enough. Where are the tests, Mr. President?
1243988972432265216 2020-03-28 12:50:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mr. President, this isn’t about you, it’s about the health of the American people. Stop making everything personal.  You are the president of all 50 states — not just the ones that voted for you or that have governors who “treat you right.” It’s time you acted like it.
1243966912951918592 2020-03-28 11:23:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be clear: No one should have to pay for coronavirus testing or treatment.
1243923892307144712 2020-03-28 08:32:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> Last night, the great Rev. Joseph E. Lowery passed away, leaving an indelible mark on our country's history towards progress. He never once wavered in his spirit and in the resolve to end injustice — wherever he saw it. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.
1243717694572179457 2020-03-27 18:53:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I just wrapped up tonight’s CNN town hall, where we discussed COVID-19 and how we move forward. I know times are tough, but the stakes in this election have never been higher. If you could chip in a few dollars I would really appreciate it.  https://t.co/1PoT5yD9CO
1243701965386850305 2020-03-27 17:50:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> You can't deal with the economic crisis until you deal with the public health crisis. It's a false choice.
1243670382902759424 2020-03-27 15:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In response to the economic impact of COVID-19, we need to provide immediate relief to those who are drowning in student debt.  https://t.co/kyZstGHHCG
1243632793927577600 2020-03-27 13:15:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> Join me and the hardworking folks on the frontlines of the COVID-19 outbreak for a virtual round table. Tune in now:  https://t.co/SKRTT621IO
1243621727642542081 2020-03-27 12:31:39 -0800 <JoeBiden> This afternoon, I’ll be sitting down for a conversation with nurses, firefighters, and emergency medical technicians on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19. Tune in at 4:15 ET to join us:  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50
1243594531611828226 2020-03-27 10:43:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> Patients need ventilators.  Nurses need equipment.  And Donald Trump is attacking people who dare to do something about it.   I thank God every day for people like @GovWhitmer, who are doing the work he won’t.
1243575004702208000 2020-03-27 09:26:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The coronavirus is not Donald Trump's fault, but his inept response is.  He ignored the warnings for months, downplayed the threat it posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak.  It's one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history.
1243533113625542657 2020-03-27 06:39:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s never a matter of if another pandemic will happen, it’s just a matter of when — and it’s the president’s job to ensure we’re ready.  Donald Trump's careless, shortsighted actions left our nation ill-prepared and now Americans are paying the price.
1243349519179317249 2020-03-26 18:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The relief bill passed by Congress was a good start, but now we need to:  - Forgive at least $10,000 of student loan debt per person - Provide emergency paid sick leave to everyone who needs it - Ensure no one has to pay for COVID-19 treatment or an eventual vaccine
1243339452530843648 2020-03-26 17:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The American people are incredible. Across the country, folks are pulling together, helping one another, and doing what needs to be done to stop the spread. I'm so darn proud to be an American.  https://t.co/bCyYCFBAML
1243329134341783564 2020-03-26 17:09:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he bears full responsibility for the slow and uncoordinated response. The harsh reality is that at least 3 million people now don’t have jobs because he didn’t do his job when it mattered.  https://t.co/xlLlQCHn3c
1243316048255791106 2020-03-26 16:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, and everyone on the front lines of this fight. Your hard work is what makes America run every single day — but especially in times of crisis. We truly couldn't get through this without you.  https://t.co/kr8Q6Me77H
1243303345076535308 2020-03-26 15:26:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Trump Administration misled the American people.
1243286275274178560 2020-03-26 14:18:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> We've gotta act now to keep the doors open for small businesses on Main Street.  It's simple: The government provides the guarantees; the banks have to move the loans out fast.  If they won't, we need a financial version of the Defense Production Act to make it happen.
1243266475965775881 2020-03-26 13:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> If I were President, here's what I would do right now:  - Use all available authorities to turn the tide on this epidemic - Launch a task force to ensure money rapidly gets to people who need it - Bring leaders of Congress together to build the next deal  https://t.co/F14kf8MRUF
1243255073817460741 2020-03-26 12:14:42 -0800 <JoeBiden> Live from our homes to yours. Looking forward to tonight, @JimmyKimmel.
1243233756183494661 2020-03-26 10:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's hard to believe this has to be said, but if I'm elected president, I will always lead the way with science. I will listen to the experts and heed their advice. I will do the opposite of what we’re seeing Donald Trump do every day.
1243208171419774976 2020-03-26 09:08:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> Across the country, ordinary people are stepping up and doing extraordinary things — folks like Isaac and Stephanie, who are creating supplies for their local hospitals. Stories like this one make me so proud to be an American. We will overcome this challenge — together.
1243182920912822272 2020-03-26 07:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Senate passed a major economic relief package late last night. It's a very important step, but the key is how it will be executed. If I were President, here's how I'd make it work:  https://t.co/RmcOh0rRPL
1242979580941492226 2020-03-25 18:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> "If the administration had reacted to the ventilator shortage in February, a private sector effort starting now might have made lifesaving equipment in mid- to late April. Now it is unlikely to be before June."  Donald Trump's inaction will cost lives.  https://t.co/83kiIngP6o
1242967501442412544 2020-03-25 17:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In times of crisis, American presidents have always stepped up to meet the moment. But all we've gotten from Donald Trump are lies, excuses, and scapegoats.  Trump has failed our country at a time when we need him most.  https://t.co/d2vxUHGiH0
1242942917229948928 2020-03-25 15:34:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> Alright @TeamJoe, join us for Happy Hour. Watch our virtual round table on the issues that matter to young folks:  https://t.co/pFhYghw5dt
1242940651542626304 2020-03-25 15:25:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> We will not allow this pandemic to rob our young people of the futures and the economic opportunities they have been working to build.  https://t.co/IMsaB6Eeba
1242910626738913282 2020-03-25 13:26:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Dr. Fauci should be on TV a lot more than President Trump.  https://t.co/Q6Oa9kGCZr
1242891248983105536 2020-03-25 12:09:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Alright, folks. We're doing a happy hour tonight and you're invited. Join us at 6:30 PM ET at  https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq.  https://t.co/2Y8lpI2bEj
1242860175444168705 2020-03-25 10:05:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm about to deliver remarks on the impact of the Coronavirus on Young Americans. Tune in to watch live:  https://t.co/hOoL3U77Ni
1242854748551819264 2020-03-25 09:43:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> The character of the American people is on full display across the country. In the middle of a crisis, folks are stepping up and doing what they can to help out those in need. The Angeleno Campaign, led by my friend Mayor @EricGarcetti, is a great example of the work being done.
1242814745423384578 2020-03-25 07:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The American people are rising to meet this moment. We need our president to do the same.
1242604610319192065 2020-03-24 17:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be very clear: No one is expendable. No matter your age, race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability.  No life is worth losing to add one more point to the Dow.
1242594795723173894 2020-03-24 16:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump says no one saw this coming, but that’s just not true. Our own intelligence officials were warning of the coronavirus threat back in January. Trump ignored them, and now we’re paying the price.  https://t.co/HCNDWim5Oc
1242564346074607619 2020-03-24 14:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As Americans, we may be physically apart, but we are truly all in this together. When we have stood as one, this nation has never been defeated. And we are not going to be defeated now.  https://t.co/T3pFw3DQlj
1242545627768197123 2020-03-24 13:15:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump should stop attacking our nation's governors on Twitter and start delivering them the life-saving supplies they need.
1242534145865089027 2020-03-24 12:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be clear: Donald Trump knew about the threat the coronavirus posed and failed to act. It’s one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in American history.  https://t.co/l8BdATZsaL
1242521059850510341 2020-03-24 11:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The stakes in this election couldn’t be higher. Donald Trump is wholly unfit to lead this nation — and that has become even clearer in the last few weeks. We have to vote him out of the White House.
1242502232370749443 2020-03-24 10:23:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> It has been a month since this tweet.
1242461164975591429 2020-03-24 07:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know we are up to this challenge. The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. We can and will overcome this — together.
1242266351084998656 2020-03-23 18:45:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> As this public health crisis rages, with the economy in peril, and with front line workers putting their lives at risk — Trump and Republican Attorneys-General are attempting to strip health insurance away from millions.  No more games. Drop this lawsuit. Save lives.  https://t.co/aSgzVzOvlV
1242240964288286721 2020-03-23 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In January, Donald Trump claimed the coronavirus was “totally under control.”  In February, he said it would disappear.  Now, he’s saying it “could’ve been stopped pretty easily if we had known.”  Donald Trump knew. He failed to act. And now we’re paying the price.
1242227794089779201 2020-03-23 16:12:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> Across the country, there are incredible stories of folks stepping up to help their neighbors, stories like this one. It's who we are as Americans. Brave and big-hearted. Always willing to lend a hand and care for those in need.  We will overcome this, together.
1242209758603403264 2020-03-23 15:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Where are the tests? Where are the masks? Where are the ventilators?  The American people deserve answers, Mr. President.  https://t.co/N2MWYKOzOu
1242176036390842368 2020-03-23 12:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Obamacare was a big deal — and that still holds true a decade later. On its tenth anniversary, we need to double down on our efforts to protect it from Donald Trump's attacks and build on it to ensure every American receives the care they need.  https://t.co/aXqHL7LN9f
1242166298714476550 2020-03-23 12:08:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> A $500 billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions is unacceptable. We have to ensure the help these companies receive goes to their workers — not their CEOs.  It's time for President Trump and Mitch McConnell to put American families first.
1242141560193630211 2020-03-23 10:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> During a public health crisis, it's unconscionable that Donald Trump and others are continuing a lawsuit designed to strip millions of people of their health insurance. This morning, I called on them to drop the lawsuit and protect Americans' health care.  https://t.co/PlfeFNwhG2
1242128161657229313 2020-03-23 09:36:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> What is President Trump waiting for?   Health care workers don't have enough masks to keep themselves safe.  Hospitals are running low on ventilators that sick Americans could literally need to breathe.  He needs to act now to deliver these essential supplies. Lives depend on it.
1242100712890195968 2020-03-23 07:47:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm about to deliver remarks on the Coronavirus pandemic. Tune in to watch live:  https://t.co/HpaqlEb7D1
1242091730872107013 2020-03-23 07:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put a corporate bailout ahead of families. It's simply wrong. We need to be focused on helping hardworking Americans, communities, and small businesses — not handing big corporations a blank check.  https://t.co/tMBZm26h3y
1241904225396891649 2020-03-22 18:46:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s simple: President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put corporate bailouts ahead of families. And it’s wrong. Hardworking, struggling Americans should come first — not the big corporations looking for a blank check.  https://t.co/pxGrnTYebF
1241884112778035200 2020-03-22 17:27:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump’s dithering on preparing us for this global pandemic and his lies about his response to this dangerous crisis is one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in American history.   https://t.co/pFIoZCJWmH
1241869420944863232 2020-03-22 16:28:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> In this moment of crisis, we should be sending federal resources to those who need it most. It's not just good economics — it's the right thing to do. We have to get this right.
1241869419988619265 2020-03-22 16:28:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> We should also increase monthly Social Security checks by $200/month, as proposed by Senator Wyden and colleagues. Seniors and people with disabilities are uniquely at risk right now.
1241869418981920769 2020-03-22 16:28:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> Additionally, we should forgive a minimum of $10,000/person of federal student loans, as proposed by Senator Warren and colleagues. Young people and other student debt holders bore the brunt of the last crisis. It shouldn't happen again.
1241843344034103301 2020-03-22 14:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On March 6th, Donald Trump claimed: “Anybody that wants a test can get a test.”  That was a flat-out lie then, and it’s still not true today. It’s a disgrace.  We need to ensure everyone who needs a test can get one free of charge. Period.
1241813347206672384 2020-03-22 12:45:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> No bill should pass without immediate, generous relief for workers who are losing jobs and hours, small businesses losing revenue, and communities facing emergency needs.
1241813346174844929 2020-03-22 12:45:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> No bill should pass without conditions on corporations to ensure the help they get goes to their workers, not their CEOs. No blank checks.
1241813344610328576 2020-03-22 12:45:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's simple: The White House and @senatemajldr have tried to put corporate bailouts ahead of families.
1241800059186040835 2020-03-22 11:53:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We owe a debt of gratitude to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, transportation workers, public safety officials, and everyone working around the clock to keep our country running. Thank you, thank you, thank you for all you’re doing.
1241772947066544135 2020-03-22 10:05:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mr. President — stop lying and start acting. Use the full extent of your authorities, now, to ensure that we are producing all essential goods and delivering them where they need to go.
1241745449209352193 2020-03-22 08:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In times of crisis, a president should calm and heal, lead the way with a steady hand, and provide a beacon of hope for the American people.  Donald Trump is incapable of doing that.  https://t.co/0I7ZYNtqCV
1241492280709537793 2020-03-21 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need action, not more empty words from President Trump. It’s time for him to step up and do his job.  https://t.co/TBpXhoAg1P
1241471645233053699 2020-03-21 14:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump has failed the American people.  https://t.co/HsNl9M4h4r
1241416531684331526 2020-03-21 10:29:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Everyone knows that we're facing a real crisis from the coronavirus. But do you know how we got here and what we need to do next? Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, breaks it down for us:  https://t.co/XRkIw2EzM4
1241406213864280064 2020-03-21 09:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The coronavirus test should be made widely available and free.  The coronavirus vaccine, when ready, should be made widely available and free.  Treatment for coronavirus should be free, too.  We're in a crisis. No one should have to pay for their coronavirus health care costs.
1241387087989026822 2020-03-21 08:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> From day one, the goal of our campaign has been to unite the country — and in times of crisis, that goal is more important than ever. If we come together and all do our part, we will overcome this. I promise.
1241170839254568960 2020-03-20 18:12:42 -0800 <JoeBiden> The president has been behind the curve throughout this whole response. He’s talking about yesterday rather than where we need to be tomorrow. The president needs to stop talking and start rallying government action with the urgency and ambition this moment demands.
1241170838478520321 2020-03-20 18:12:42 -0800 <JoeBiden> Now he’s switched to falsely telling us that he’s taking action that he has not taken, and promising results that he’s not delivering. People are scared. They're frightened. And their president is just exacerbating their concerns.
1241170837568438273 2020-03-20 18:12:42 -0800 <JoeBiden> In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. Donald Trump has not been that president. For months, he falsely told us we had nothing to worry about while praising China’s response for managing the coronavirus.
1241147005658755072 2020-03-20 16:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If you have a minute, read these stories of folks coming together and helping out their neighbors. They represent who we are as Americans. In times of crisis, we stand as one. We look out for each other. And that’s how we’ll get through this — together.  https://t.co/rardKq7Dtd
1241122660148490252 2020-03-20 15:01:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> The President says no one cares about being tested.  Have you or a loved one had trouble getting tested?
1241104438846259201 2020-03-20 13:48:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> Getting money quickly to families is the right goal, but Senate Republicans are proposing to send significantly lower amounts to low-income families than those with higher incomes. That’s terrible economics &amp; terrible values. We should be targeting help to those who need it most.
1241077046022787074 2020-03-20 12:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The lack of coronavirus testing in the U.S. is a national disgrace.  https://t.co/kD9cEFtAUR
1241027971760025603 2020-03-20 08:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The least we can do for every grocery and retail worker working around the clock during this crisis is to provide a $15 minimum wage, paid sick leave, and strong workplace protections.
1240998490383224832 2020-03-20 06:47:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every CEO in America should be focusing on workers, families, and communities — not executive compensation and share prices.
1240998489498288129 2020-03-20 06:47:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> I am calling on every CEO in America to publicly commit now to not buying back their company's stock over the course of the next year. As workers face the physical and economic consequences of the coronavirus, our corporate leaders cannot cede responsibility for their employees.
1240808170651619329 2020-03-19 18:11:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@SenGillibrand has never been afraid to speak without fear, to be brave in the face of injustice, and to empower others to get off the sidelines. I'm thrilled and honored to have her support.
1240798575468175364 2020-03-19 17:33:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> The words of a president matter, and Donald Trump has used his to downplay COVID-19 and mislead the American people. He is unfit to lead us through this crisis.
1240778927431352325 2020-03-19 16:15:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> This administration is truly morally bankrupt.
1240761659888672769 2020-03-19 15:06:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every worker on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 deserves protections and accommodations that keep them and their families safe. I'm glad to see states stepping up to support folks — employers must do the same.
1240711637218123777 2020-03-19 11:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My prayers go out to all those on the front lines of this crisis.  https://t.co/KfNNRsdS7I
1240690266358480896 2020-03-19 10:23:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> Doctors and nurses are making their own makeshift face masks today as they risk their lives to care for others. What other finding do you need to see to convince you to use every power you have to expand our supply of essential equipment, Mr. President?
1240690264357793792 2020-03-19 10:23:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> Yesterday, President Trump said he was invoking the Defense Production Act, then turned around and said he wasn't planning to use it. The President should exercise these powers now. We need more ventilators, protective equipment, and critical supplies. We need action, not words.
1240675649968168960 2020-03-19 09:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@TulsiGabbard has put her life on the line in service of this country and continues to serve with honor today. I’m grateful to have her support and look forward to working with her to restore honor and decency to the White House.
1240670113713528833 2020-03-19 09:03:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is a moment to look out for our neighbors, care for the elderly, and thank the workers on the front lines of this fight. This is a moment to believe in one another.  When we do that, when we see the best in each of us, we’ll lift this nation up and get through this together.
1240646710021537792 2020-03-19 07:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Obama-Biden Administration set up the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense to prepare for future pandemics like COVID-19.  Donald Trump eliminated it — and now we're paying the price.
1240447899621658624 2020-03-18 18:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our campaign is building the broad coalition we need to win in November.  https://t.co/cINCXLJnn0
1240436952538775553 2020-03-18 17:36:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> I give you my word as a Biden: When I'm president, I will lead with science, listen to the experts and heed their advice, and always tell you the truth.
1240423237126737920 2020-03-18 16:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It is a national disgrace that millions of Americans do not have a single day of paid sick leave.
1240408892166660096 2020-03-18 15:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need comprehensive action to combat the coronavirus outbreak. That's why I'm calling for a decisive public health response to curb its spread and provide treatment to those in need, and a decisive economic response that delivers real relief.  https://t.co/xjxsDmKPe3
1240378693379293195 2020-03-18 13:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know the American people have the capacity to meet this moment. There’s nothing we’ve been unable to accomplish if we do it together.
1240361258957897728 2020-03-18 12:35:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> Stop the xenophobic fear-mongering. Be honest. Take responsibility. Do your job.
1240343464405086209 2020-03-18 11:25:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Much has been made of changes in President Trump's tone in recent days. But with our health care system at risk, a virus spreading, our economy on the brink — and so many lives at stake — it’s time to be less interested in his words and more focused on his actions — or inaction.
1240318546896228353 2020-03-18 09:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In times of crisis, Americans stand as one. Volunteers raise their hands to help. Neighbors look out for neighbors. Businesses take care of their workers. That's who we are.  We can and will meet this challenge — together.  https://t.co/xGcTQuc2gB
1240280546699366401 2020-03-18 07:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The next president will have to salvage our reputation, rebuild confidence in our leadership, and mobilize our country and our allies to rapidly meet new challenges — like future pandemics.  We need a leader who will be ready on day one.  https://t.co/oizwBqv4Wd
1240114271406653440 2020-03-17 20:14:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you, Arizona!
1240106902274494466 2020-03-17 19:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to everyone in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois who supported our campaign. From day one, our goal has been to unify our party and our nation — and tonight, we are one step closer to achieving that goal. Let’s do this, together.  https://t.co/tcLufz2SBV
1240089565743874048 2020-03-17 18:36:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm about to address tonight's election results from Delaware. Tune in to watch live:  https://t.co/zNUoV08KVa
1240072327972491266 2020-03-17 17:27:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you, Illinois!
1240066849674575873 2020-03-17 17:05:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you, Florida!
1240040212903968770 2020-03-17 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This moment demands that we choose:  Hope over fear Unity over division Truth over lies Science over fiction
1240004225641394177 2020-03-17 12:57:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This crisis requires a decisive economic response. We need to do whatever it takes to deliver relief for our families and ensure the stability of our economy.
1239988874807586816 2020-03-17 11:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Elections are happening today in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois. I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can. If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don’t touch your face, and stay 6’ from others in line. Learn more:  https://t.co/yzZZp4uKFk
1239940807966085122 2020-03-17 08:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My mom always said, "Being Irish is about faith, family, and courage."  Today, we celebrate the strong role Irish-Americans have played in our communities, the strength of the U.S.-Ireland relationship, and the ongoing values shared by our two nations. Happy St. Patrick's Day!  https://t.co/iUwvpb4Zk8
1239932555333373960 2020-03-17 08:12:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> Michigan’s response has far outpaced the federal government’s in this crisis. Gov. Whitmer is leading decisively, while you are live-tweeting her appearances on cable news.  We need a president who will do their job and lead this country.
1239734203555762177 2020-03-16 19:04:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you, Washington!
1239729414809608193 2020-03-16 18:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Coronavirus is bigger than any one of us. Please take care of yourself, wash your hands, and practice social distancing. We will get through this — together.  https://t.co/133eiugfnJ
1239694182697992192 2020-03-16 16:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If I win the nomination, my pick for vice president will be a woman. If I win the presidency and have the opportunity, I will name the first black woman ever to the Supreme Court.  A Biden administration will reflect the country we are proud to work for.  https://t.co/1rFvE94YIg
1239669017327087622 2020-03-16 14:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Donald Trump threatens everything we stand for, he has:  - Fanned the flames of hate - Embraced white supremacists - Separated families at the border - Threatened our democracy  We have to get him out of the White House.
1239653917740466179 2020-03-16 13:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The coronavirus pandemic is bigger than any one individual. This moment requires all of us to come together — across the country and around the world — to solve this crisis.  https://t.co/cbPrIYyjsa
1239631268209479682 2020-03-16 12:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the wake of the coronavirus, we need a major bailout package that delivers real relief to the American people — not more handouts for giant corporations.  https://t.co/Fi8SwNXDU5
1239618931058511875 2020-03-16 11:25:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to our health care providers, first responders, grocery and other retail workers, and so many others that are keeping us safe and prepared. This coronavirus pandemic makes it clear that all workers deserve paid sick live, workplace protections and unemployment benefits.
1239559042214825991 2020-03-16 07:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who will always choose science over fiction.
1239411048232505347 2020-03-15 21:39:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know times are tough — but we’re going to get through this.   We’ve got four big primaries coming up on Tuesday, and our campaign could really use your help. Chip in what you can — I really appreciate it:  https://t.co/CoE18Qvo1b  https://t.co/lfA6xEp9MI
1239374325041463296 2020-03-15 19:14:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> $90 billion in clean energy funding. A huge reduction in the cost of solar so that we'll never build another coal plant again.     I did that. Bernie watched. #DemDebate
1239371922204483584 2020-03-15 19:04:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're building the campaign that will win this nomination and defeat Donald Trump. If you're with us, please chip in what you can right now to keep the momentum going from tonight's #DemDebate:  https://t.co/K7gZczYZlN
1239371184279621633 2020-03-15 19:01:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> Watch me.
1239370040404828160 2020-03-15 18:56:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> The coronavirus pandemic is like a war. And in a war, you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people. #DemDebate  https://t.co/3U1aarm3Ho
1239367915171971072 2020-03-15 18:48:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a comprehensive response to the coronavirus outbreak. My plan mounts a decisive public health response to curb the spread of this disease and provide treatment to those in need, and a decisive economic response that delivers real relief.   https://t.co/xjxsDn2qCD  https://t.co/WQgl2SyM4z
1239365671898750977 2020-03-15 18:39:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> Xenophobia is a disease. #DemDebate
1239364431294926848 2020-03-15 18:34:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to treat climate change like the existential threat it is. As president, I will:  - End subsidies for fossil fuel corporations - Ban new drilling on federal lands &amp; waters - Hold oil executives accountable - Rally the world to raise the commitments of the Paris Agreement
1239364065413267456 2020-03-15 18:33:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> No se puede negar la amenaza existencial del cambio climático, y se está acabando el tiempo para abordarlo. Tenemos que tomar medidas sin precedentes aquí en nuestro país y unir al mundo para hacer frente a esta crisis.   Lea el plan completo:  https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo
1239363997817868290 2020-03-15 18:32:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> There is no denying the existential threat of climate change — and time is running out to address it. We have to take unprecedented action here at home and rally the world to tackle this crisis head on.   Read the full plan:  https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo
1239360027372204033 2020-03-15 18:17:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> Bernie Sanders voted against comprehensive immigration reform — and then went on TV with Lou Dobbs to brag about it.  Immigrants don't take our jobs. They create jobs. And we need a President who believes that to his or her core. #DemDebate  https://t.co/lHePLtlTpo
1239358461999222784 2020-03-15 18:10:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> My running mate will be a woman. #DemDebate
1239356795463794688 2020-03-15 18:04:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> If Senator @BernieSanders is the nominee, I will throw my full weight behind his campaign and do everything I can to get him elected. If I am the nominee, I hope he will do the same. Nothing can keep us from being united in the fight to defeat Trump. #DemDebate
1239356529612132353 2020-03-15 18:03:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady background check bill that has kept 3 million firearms out of dangerous hands, not once, not twice, but five times.   We need a president who will stand up to the @NRA — not one who stood with them against lifesaving gun safety measures.
1239354904004698112 2020-03-15 17:56:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> I took on Paul Ryan's cuts to Medicare and Social Security — to his face. #DemDebate  https://t.co/wXp61eg5lf
1239353763820961792 2020-03-15 17:52:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> People need help now. Not four years from now. Not eight years from now. We need a health care plan that can pass. #DemDebate
1239353172835082240 2020-03-15 17:49:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> Senator @BernieSanders' attacks on my record on Social Security are a bunch of malarkey — and @PolitiFact agrees.  We should be focused on going after Donald Trump — not fellow Democrats. #DemDebate  https://t.co/PEfKDyUBlW
1239352291448233984 2020-03-15 17:46:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> All those people Bernie says he cares about would have been in deep trouble without the bailout in 2008/2009. It was about saving the economy — and I agree with Bernie, some bank executives should have gone to jail. #DemDebate
1239348555736907776 2020-03-15 17:31:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> People want results, not a revolution. #DemDebate
1239346578684510215 2020-03-15 17:23:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is bigger than any one of us. This calls for a national rallying to come together. #DemDebate
1239345243696160768 2020-03-15 17:18:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is a crisis. We’re at war with a virus.   No one should have to pay for coronavirus health care costs. #DemDebate
1239339344537604096 2020-03-15 16:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need leadership that listens to science.   We need leaders who listen to experts and heed their advice.   We need American leadership that will rally the world to meet global threats.   We need leaders who are honest.   That is the responsibility of a president.  https://t.co/zcdYiNWRCf
1239322986823352321 2020-03-15 15:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When we have a coronavirus vaccine ready to go, it should be made widely available, free of charge. Period.
1239280178091692032 2020-03-15 12:59:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> This primary has brought out our party's best ideas, and our nation is better for it. If I'm President, I'll continue to bring the best ideas from all corners of the country and fight to make them reality. To see these plans, you can go to my website:  https://t.co/8bAii5T2FF
1239280177324134404 2020-03-15 12:59:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> Second: Few people in the country understand how bankruptcy hurts working families more than Elizabeth Warren. Today, I am fully endorsing and adopting her bankruptcy plan, which she called "Fixing Our Bankruptcy System to Give People a Second Chance."
1239280176594288643 2020-03-15 12:59:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> First: Bernie has put forward a plan that would make public colleges and universities free for families whose income is below $125,000. It's a good idea, and after consideration, I am proud to add it to my platform.
1239280175826731010 2020-03-15 12:59:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> Across the country, middle and working class families are being squeezed by debt. This is a massive problem, and one that we need all of the best ideas to solve. That's why today, I'm adopting two plans from @BernieSanders and @ewarren to achieve this.
1239258814005694464 2020-03-15 11:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I can promise you that when I'm President, we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better.  https://t.co/FwxXvfTchd
1239236425364787202 2020-03-15 10:06:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm incredibly grateful for @SpeakerPelosi's leadership every day — but especially in times of crisis. @senatemajldr McConnell should bring back the Senate immediately and pass this important bill to provide relief for American families.
1239201266410164224 2020-03-15 07:46:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> If you're exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 — or might be at risk — absentee or vote by mail options are the best way to make your voice heard, while protecting your neighbors.
1239200647616004096 2020-03-15 07:43:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> The right to vote is the most sacred American right there is. State election officials are working closely with public health officials to hold safe elections. If you are feeling healthy, not showing symptoms, and not at risk of being exposed to COVID-19: please vote on Tuesday.
1238957075637497856 2020-03-14 15:36:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The coronavirus will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender, or zip code. It will touch people in positions of power and the most vulnerable in our society.  We need to take action to combat it.   https://t.co/6TVMKr9ygx  https://t.co/E7J9olEhIR
1238901774112755714 2020-03-14 11:56:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> The American people have the capacity to meet this moment. We will come together, look out for one another, and harness the ingenuity of our scientists. We can and will meet this challenge—together.  https://t.co/xjxsDn2qCD
1238901773307445249 2020-03-14 11:56:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> This crisis requires a national response. Not just from our elected leaders, or public health officials—but from all of us. We must follow the guidance of the @CDCgov and health officials and take appropriate precautions to protect ourselves and, critically, to protect others.
1238901772455993351 2020-03-14 11:56:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know many are anxious about the spread of the coronavirus and the threat it poses. And my thoughts are with all those affected, our first responders and health care providers who are putting themselves on the line for others, and everyone making sacrifices to stop the spread.
1238875185773772802 2020-03-14 10:10:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> The White House is no place for on-the-job training — Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus has made that even more clear. We need a president who is ready to clean up his mess, take responsibility, and lead us forward on day one.
1238526488774938625 2020-03-13 11:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re building a campaign powered by the backbone and the base of the Democratic party. A campaign that will defeat Donald Trump and restore the soul of this nation. Join us:  https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW
1238469865578606593 2020-03-13 07:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe this nation can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if he’s given eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation.  We can’t let that happen. We have to defeat Donald Trump.
1238269797197987840 2020-03-12 18:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> At a moment when there is so much fear around the world, we need honest, steady, trusted American leadership.  If I’m elected president, I promise you I'll strive to give the nation that very leadership every day.  https://t.co/WjOHDVMb6X
1238254697695326209 2020-03-12 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A wall will not stop the coronavirus.  Banning all travel from Europe — or any other part of the world — will not stop it.  This disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet — and we need a plan to combat it.
1238237081501130753 2020-03-12 15:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@CoryBooker is right — this is our moment in history. We need your help to beat Donald Trump and set our nation on a new path. If you’re with us, chip in today:  https://t.co/SxalF8DnNU  https://t.co/kfq0AMwyZm
1238212670660083712 2020-03-12 14:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No president can promise to prevent future outbreaks, but I can promise you this: When I'm president, we will be better prepared, respond better, and recover better. We'll lead with science and listen to the experts. And I will always, always tell you the truth.
1238182975109500929 2020-03-12 12:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need to ensure that every person who needs a coronavirus test can get one — and that the test is free. Period.
1238175676940853248 2020-03-12 11:51:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, I'm releasing my plan to combat the coronavirus. We need:  - A decisive public health response to curb the spread of this disease and provide treatment to those in need - A decisive economic response that delivers real relief  https://t.co/xjxsDn2qCD
1238155901753683968 2020-03-12 10:32:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm about to address the nation on how we should confront the corona virus pandemic. Tune in to watch live:  https://t.co/OdaeTNw40B

1238117544604680192 2020-03-12 08:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> At this moment — when there is so much fear in the country and all across the world — we need American leadership. We need presidential leadership.  Today at 1:00 PM EST, I’ll be addressing the nation on how we should be moving forward to confront the #CoronavirusPandemic.
1238108735798681601 2020-03-12 07:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Together, we're creating a movement that will defeat Donald Trump and restore the soul of this nation.  https://t.co/vAylAFIwFn
1237893066981117956 2020-03-11 17:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump's "Remain in Mexico" policy is dangerous, inhumane, and goes against everything we stand for as a nation of immigrants. My administration will end it.
1237885911809081344 2020-03-11 16:39:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> After last night, we are one step closer to restoring decency, dignity, and honor to the White House.
1237865885551022080 2020-03-11 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I wish Donald Trump would just be quiet and let the experts do the talking when it comes to the coronavirus.  https://t.co/x47PGPls2Y
1237835183321120770 2020-03-11 13:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@AndrewYang is one of the brightest minds there is when it comes to the challenges we face in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. I'm honored to have his endorsement — and look forward to working with him to ensure every worker can succeed in the changing 21st-century economy.
1237823320206258177 2020-03-11 12:30:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today is a historic day for the #MeToo movement &amp; for survivors of sexual violence. The bravery of those who stopped Weinstein cannot be overstated, &amp; the burden of speaking out cannot be on survivors alone. We have to change our culture &amp; our system to end sexual assault.
1237795924656578560 2020-03-11 10:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If you're a member of the #KHive, know that there is a home for you in our campaign. I would be honored to have your support.  https://t.co/3GqvPi1E0y
1237762706939273217 2020-03-11 08:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Once we get Donald Trump out of the White House, we have an enormous opportunity to build the future this nation deserves. A future where every American has access to affordable health care, where we end our gun violence epidemic, and where we tackle the climate crisis head-on.
1237739049735073797 2020-03-11 06:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is incapable of effectively handling the coronavirus crisis.  https://t.co/dKLazVkJgw
1237595289491517440 2020-03-10 21:24:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's been a great night — thank you for all of your support!

1237436556685627392 2020-03-10 10:54:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who will stand up to the @NRA — not stand with them against gun safety reform.  https://t.co/ORwxGiSJHY
1237410887650041856 2020-03-10 09:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I give you my word as a Biden: If I am elected president, I will do everything in my power to protect our children from gun violence.  https://t.co/MQjnz97S0m
1237388993869774848 2020-03-10 07:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today’s the day! If you live in ID, MI, MS, MO, ND, or WA head to  https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M to confirm your polling location and make sure to get out and vote.  https://t.co/8QgL6QT4op
1237373939837526016 2020-03-10 06:45:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> A wall won’t stop a virus. Racism won’t stop a virus.  Do your job.
1237177600314753025 2020-03-09 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Nothing can top this endorsement.  https://t.co/sfJpFQ8ig8
1237162500757409794 2020-03-09 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I put my faith in Michigan in the depths of the Great Recession — and if you believe, as I do, that our greatest days still lie ahead, I hope that you’ll put your faith in Team Joe tomorrow.  https://t.co/OvL5KU2Vap
1237151428201897985 2020-03-09 16:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I wish a Happy Holi to those celebrating the arrival of spring and the Festival of Colors! May the rest of your year be filled with a rainbow of colors and optimism. #Holi2020
1237133991855169536 2020-03-09 14:51:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> In moments of crisis, presidential leadership is even more important. But time and time again, Donald Trump has proven just how incapable he is of rising to the occasion. He is dangerously unfit to lead our country through a global health challenge.
1237109652568944644 2020-03-09 13:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Now is not the time to divide the party and tear down fellow Democrats. Now is the time to come together to defeat Donald Trump.  https://t.co/rkCHKL19dU
1237100844559904769 2020-03-09 12:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our diversity is, and has always been, our greatest strength as a nation. Donald Trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does.
1237088318602579970 2020-03-09 11:50:13 -0800 <JoeBiden> Senator @CoryBooker is joining me on the campaign trail in Flint, Michigan. Tune in to watch live:  https://t.co/FlNzrqt8Nq
1237073537342603264 2020-03-09 10:51:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're building the campaign that will defeat Donald Trump — and his team is worried. Chip in to help us make Trump a one-term president:  https://t.co/evWQiKMRWT
1237049339241005056 2020-03-09 09:15:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> Cory — Your leadership has given hope to so many and has inspired our nation to rise to meet the challenges of today. I'm incredibly grateful for your endorsement — and I look forward to working alongside you to unite the country and defeat Donald Trump.
1236834273526779904 2020-03-08 19:00:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> On the anniversary of the passage of #HR1, we must recommit ourselves to eliminating all private dollars from our federal elections and restoring the Voting Rights Act.  Our government should work #ForThePeople — not just the powerful.
1236823760210141184 2020-03-08 18:18:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@JohnDelaney is a man of great character, and I'm honored to have his endorsement. Together, we'll beat Donald Trump and restore the soul of this nation.
1236805146312466432 2020-03-08 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in a battle for the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. We have to get him out of the White House.
1236792814823849985 2020-03-08 16:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In Mississippi — and around the nation — the daily scourge of gun violence is tearing our communities apart. Enough is enough. We can’t go on like this. We have to take on the @NRA and end our gun violence epidemic.  https://t.co/OGXm9V5IdX
1236769913995313152 2020-03-08 14:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we are to realize the dream of gender equality, we can't be disheartened or disengaged. Instead we must recommit to fighting for progress, for our own sake and for the sake of all peoples. We can — and will — do this.  Join us:  https://t.co/py7dyozsYx  https://t.co/PJdq16s6xc
1236760575528464384 2020-03-08 14:07:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm about to take the stage from Mississippi. Tune in to watch live:  https://t.co/5VopdE1MvO
1236727132044304387 2020-03-08 11:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On this #InternationalWomensDay, it’s a hard truth that, in 2020, we have not yet reached gender equality in our society. I promise that, as president, I will use every tool available to me and take every opportunity to change that.  https://t.co/iRRzgi77cg
1236702218092515333 2020-03-08 10:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we give Donald Trump four more years in the White House, our planet may never recover.
1236623516226785283 2020-03-08 05:03:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> Kamala — You’ve spent your whole career fighting for folks who’ve been written off and left behind — and no small part of that alongside Beau. From our family: thank you.   https://t.co/ePtRKVjzXB

1236449049865224194 2020-03-07 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> “Rosie the Riveter" represents the American women who worked in factories during World War II.  Their resilience and hard work helped us win the war.    Agnes was one of them. I called her on her 100th birthday, and I could not be more proud to have her support.  https://t.co/2toIvuhmsw

1236408784492298240 2020-03-07 13:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If you re-elect Donald Trump, he's going to cut Medicare and Social Security. I'm going to protect and expand these benefits.  https://t.co/psf4xAs3YS
1236381353811120128 2020-03-07 12:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I support #AB5 in California, which will give workers the dignity they deserve in the workplace. I agree with @transportworker that we can't let corporations undermine basic rights by adding these exemptions to ground-breaking legislation.  https://t.co/bouzgRLBU7
1236366505979154432 2020-03-07 11:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're going to rebuild the great American middle class. And this time, we're going to bring everyone along regardless of race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability.
1236360367430717440 2020-03-07 10:37:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm about to take the stage from Missouri. Tune in to watch live:  https://t.co/xVFPWVqXbn

1236324479233449984 2020-03-07 08:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I can’t tell you how much I appreciate @PeteButtigieg’s endorsement. If you supported Pete, know that there is a home for you in our campaign. Join us in the fight to restore the soul of our nation:  https://t.co/gnaFCAUzju  https://t.co/VOu3qspbEt
1236075337164812288 2020-03-06 15:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are so much better than who Donald Trump thinks we are. This is the United States of America. We treat each other with dignity, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor.
1236042621677690880 2020-03-06 13:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Climate change is the existential crisis of our time. On day one, I'll rejoin the Paris Agreement — and then rally the world to push our progress further.
1236023348481724416 2020-03-06 12:18:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> I don't care who you're supporting, attacks like this against a man who could be the first Jewish President are disgusting and beyond the pale. Hatred and bigotry have no place in America — and it's up to all of us to root out these evils wherever they're found.
1236017332478242818 2020-03-06 11:54:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s time we restore the great American middle class — and this time, make sure everyone has a chance to come along. That starts with making a $15 minimum wage the law of the land.
1236002607946067968 2020-03-06 10:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is a big moment for our campaign — and we could use your help to keep our momentum going. Chip in $5 to help us build the campaign that will defeat Donald Trump:  https://t.co/QZumn9bs3A  https://t.co/WH3diBXaiM

1235750698052202498 2020-03-05 18:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who will choose unity over division.
1235739373745958912 2020-03-05 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history — and the American people deserve to know what he is hiding in his tax returns.  https://t.co/Idfuq9J8XU
1235733748563533824 2020-03-05 17:07:39 -0800 <JoeBiden> Get real, Bernie. The only person who's going to cut Social Security if he's elected is Donald Trump. Maybe you should spend your time attacking him.
1235732075506012160 2020-03-05 17:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> For all the hard-won progress we've made in the fight for LGBTQ+ equality, we're not done — not nearly. That's why I just released my plan to advance LGBTQ+ equality in America and around the world:  https://t.co/RSlFCrVlrZ  https://t.co/8GJxnx5h8f
1235725955726893056 2020-03-05 16:36:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here's the deal, folks: social security is on the ballot this year, and the choice couldn't be clearer:   I'll protect and expand it. Donald Trump will cut it and take it away.
1235715465890205696 2020-03-05 15:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m confident that with the help of @PeteButtigieg and his supporters, we will unite this country, we will beat Donald Trump, and we will restore honor and decency to the White House.  https://t.co/zxEG7Dptzt
1235702883212918784 2020-03-05 15:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Not a joke, folks. We added a bunch of new items to our campaign store that I think you'll like. Head to  https://t.co/xnkThpmavv to stock up today.  https://t.co/lGit9Flp8V
1235650035251122176 2020-03-05 11:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We should not tear down Obamacare. Period. We need to protect and build on it with a new public option to ensure every American has access to the care they need.
1235616413479550982 2020-03-05 09:21:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> And to Bailey: Champ and Major would love to have you over any time.
1235616060906205184 2020-03-05 09:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Senator @EWarren is the fiercest of fighters for middle class families. Her work in Washington, in Massachusetts, and on the campaign trail has made a real difference in people's lives. We needed her voice in this race, and we need her continued work in the Senate.
1235563953830481920 2020-03-05 05:52:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm blown away by the grassroots energy we've seen from Pete, Amy, and Beto supporters. Tuesday wouldn't have happened without all of you. It's going to take all of us to beat Donald Trump and I'd love to have you on our team:  https://t.co/PuJ6qyW8Xz  https://t.co/ZgA442XHiS
1235374469079797762 2020-03-04 17:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are building the coalition that will defeat Donald Trump.
1235365660957474816 2020-03-04 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To everyone who has placed your faith in our campaign thus far, thank you. Your support means the world to me — and I hope I make you proud. I will do everything I can to bring this country together and restore the soul of our nation.  https://t.co/prwo6rPAct
1235347289935208448 2020-03-04 15:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm grateful that over 125 elected officials and leaders from across the country have endorsed our campaign in the last few days. Now, I'm hoping to get your endorsement.  If you're with me, let me know by adding your name today:  https://t.co/gnaFCAUzju  https://t.co/FKLhU4xAzV
1235339488802594828 2020-03-04 15:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America was built on the simple idea that we're all created equal—but we've never lived up to it. We've had to fight for it. And we've got to recognize the women who have kept the fires of justice and equality blazing, lighting the way forward for us all. #WomensHistoryMonth
1235322880314892288 2020-03-04 13:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Most Americans don't want the false promise of a revolution — they want results.  https://t.co/8ElpMRChuc
1235307108117221378 2020-03-04 12:52:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need judges who will respect Roe v. Wade as the law, and we need a Congress that will protect reproductive rights. If I'm president, that leadership will start at the top.
1235307106682777607 2020-03-04 12:52:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> There is an assault on abortion access, and today it has reached the Supreme Court. It's time for our leaders to stand up for women's rights.

1235261222854856704 2020-03-04 09:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I have said it many times in this campaign. This nation will be able to overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if this man is reelected, we won’t recognize this country in a few years.  We have to get Trump out of the White House.

1234678382207455232 2020-03-02 19:14:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I can't tell you how much Senator @AmyKlobuchar's endorsement means to me.

1234650818776911874 2020-03-02 17:24:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> This fall, Donald Trump will be trying to get the Supreme Court to strike down Obamacare — ripping insurance away from 30 million people.  I’ll be fighting to end his administration, and to secure for every American the peace of mind that comes from having affordable health care.

1234524116226539523 2020-03-02 09:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If you want a Democratic nominee who will:  - Build on Obamacare — not scrap it - Take on the @NRA and gun manufacturers — not protect them - Stand up for the middle class — not raise their taxes and make promises that can’t be kept  Then this is your campaign.
1234496181868388357 2020-03-02 07:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm incredibly honored to have the support of @latinovictoryus. Latinos are the future. They must have a voice — and as president, I will do all in my power to amplify that voice.  https://t.co/EsdccBqXbW

1233460356749680640 2020-02-28 10:34:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My dad always said, “Champ, when you get knocked down, you get back up.” I’ve been knocked down a lot in my life, like so many Americans have, but always get back up. That’s the resiliency of the American people. Given half a fighting chance, there’s nothing we can’t do.  https://t.co/e9nR5Rqn8u
1233429152461545473 2020-02-28 08:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Senator Kaine is an incredible public servant. Virginians are lucky to have him representing them in the Senate — and I'm honored to have his endorsement.  https://t.co/3h81B1yhsy
1233407760462753795 2020-02-28 07:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in a battle for the soul of this nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. We have to get him out of the White House.  https://t.co/CvICTGZUJe
1233211466502692864 2020-02-27 18:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m running for president to offer our country a different path — not back to a past that never was — but to a future that fulfills our true promise as a nation.
1233198883448082432 2020-02-27 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Barack Obama was one hell of a president.  https://t.co/Q7YacziNzh
1233190075418021889 2020-02-27 16:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> "Thanks to a man of great position and character taking an interest in him, he knows that his stutter does not define him, nor his plans for a bright future."  You raised an incredible young man, Elisa. I'm honored to have been a part of his journey.  https://t.co/lhi4T190do
1233177492640260097 2020-02-27 15:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is determined to sabotage Obamacare and roll back the progress we’ve made. We can’t let him get away with it. We have to protect and build on the law to ensure every American has access to the health care they deserve.  https://t.co/TxlvXDVjRs
1233157863402590208 2020-02-27 14:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I have a message for the @NRA and gun manufacturers: If I am elected president, I am going to take you on and I will defeat you.  https://t.co/flrQQme05e
1233152589262249985 2020-02-27 14:11:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> With nearly 2 million Dominicans and their families in the U.S., we have so much to celebrate on Dominican Republic Independence Day! The everyday contributions of Dominican Americans to our country has enriched our lives and made us stronger.
1233128772045561856 2020-02-27 12:36:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> One year later, @senatemajldr is still stonewalling the bipartisan universal background check bill. It’s unbelievable. It’s time for Mitch McConnell to stand up to the @NRA, do his job, and bring the bill up for a vote. Lives depend on it.
1233102732715872256 2020-02-27 10:52:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, thanks to you we raised $1.2M from nearly 30,000 donors yesterday. And I was even happier to hear that 1/3rd of those donors were new. I can't begin to tell you what your support means. South Carolina is just a few days away, let's keep it going:  https://t.co/LaHlq40Szj
1233093187427684353 2020-02-27 10:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Senator Sanders still hasn’t been honest about how much Medicare for All will cost and who will pay for it. The American people deserve the truth.  https://t.co/CXntweve9n
1233066762968559616 2020-02-27 08:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A $15 an hour minimum wage is long overdue, but it’s just the start. We have to make sure every single worker receives the pay and dignity they deserve.
1233044365871898625 2020-02-27 07:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I don’t take the support of the African-American community for granted. I’ve worked like the devil to earn it and will continue to work for every last vote.  https://t.co/tKuQ5UZO9q
1232889343058071556 2020-02-26 20:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, we are currently $45,000 short of raising $1 million online today. We don't have a lot of time, but if we all pitch in, we can do it. Can I count on your help? Pitch in before midnight:  https://t.co/1hxaVWklMS
1232872985985462272 2020-02-26 19:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My faith is important to me because it gives me some reason to have hope and purpose. It took a long time for me to realize, but that purpose is the thing that has saved me.  https://t.co/b44oTZWgUJ
1232859648195063809 2020-02-26 18:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If I were president today, I would not be taking China's word when it comes to the coronavirus. American scientists and health experts should be allowed in the country to determine how the virus started and to help contain its spread.  https://t.co/uSgkV7WUG8
1232854111625740293 2020-02-26 18:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We just wrapped up a great CNN town hall and could use your help to keep the momentum going. With just three days left until the South Carolina primary, every dollar makes a big difference. Chip in today:  https://t.co/VGtATHtcjd
1232851279162073089 2020-02-26 18:13:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> I taught constitutional law for a long time and here's the deal: No amendment is absolute. There are limits.  Common-sense reforms like background checks and a ban on assault weapons are not a violation of the Second Amendment. Period.
1232847579991486464 2020-02-26 17:59:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m heartbroken at the news of yet another mass shooting in America — and I’m keeping the victims and their loved ones in my prayers. We can’t go on like this any longer as a nation. It’s time we come together and pass common-sense reforms to end this epidemic.
1232821727002013702 2020-02-26 16:16:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm glad this bill — overdue now for more than a century — has passed.  Congress' failure to act on lynching will forever be a stain on the institution, but living up to the founding principles of our nation means fully coming to terms with the sins of our past.
1232812588032876544 2020-02-26 15:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In 1994, I took on the @NRA to pass a 10-year ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. The ban saved lives — and Republicans should have never let it expire.  As president, I’ll ban them once again. We will get these weapons of war out of our communities.  https://t.co/4ciJQTNxvR
1232796201029906433 2020-02-26 14:34:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m a union guy and always have been. I stand with @UFCW — and as president, I’ll invest in American workers.  We need to protect good American jobs and make sure our economy works for all Americans.
1232780170697859074 2020-02-26 13:31:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> The evidence is clear: we can’t wait to take action on climate change. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on. The survival of our planet depends on it.
1232760746523516930 2020-02-26 12:14:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need policies that allow Black Americans to create wealth. And we need policies that will let them pass it down from generation to generation.  https://t.co/Dc9kxquzij
1232725514399301633 2020-02-26 09:54:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need to put a black woman on the Supreme Court.
1232709911621951491 2020-02-26 08:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know that with folks like Bernice and the Reckoning Crew, we will win the battle for the soul of our nation. I'm so grateful to have them on our team.  Join them and get involved in your community:  https://t.co/GCxsKwomFH  https://t.co/M6m9pkP3vh
1232683784954359808 2020-02-26 07:08:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jim Clyburn is a voice of powerful moral clarity that is heard loud and clear across this country — in our capital and beyond. He reminds us why we’re in public service in the first place — and I’m proud to have his support.  https://t.co/6Lh970vjYu
1232520337759313925 2020-02-25 20:18:42 -0800 <JoeBiden> Team, we had a great debate tonight in South Carolina. I could use your help to keep this momentum going as we head toward the primary this Saturday.   With just a few days left - chip in what you can, every dollar makes a difference:  https://t.co/QPPg4XTJ10  https://t.co/jTRYsKk9Wx
1232515128085471233 2020-02-25 19:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Being a progressive means actually making progress. I’m the only one in this race who has beaten the NRA nationally and passed real gun safety reform — and I’ll do it again as president. #DemDebate  https://t.co/i5Lq1isGG5
1232505640968478720 2020-02-25 19:20:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> When everyone around you is shouting about health care reform but you're the only one who has gotten anything big done.  https://t.co/e8T3kN5Mhb
1232501877289472000 2020-02-25 19:05:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> Pitch in if you agree:  https://t.co/v7TBhD6fyE  https://t.co/maf1Q3SnHf
1232496083202269184 2020-02-25 18:42:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s be clear: Russia is engaging in interference in this election right now, as we speak. #DemDebate
1232493680079933440 2020-02-25 18:32:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> We gotta make it clear: China must play by the rules. #DemDebate
1232487335771570176 2020-02-25 18:07:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> My first effort as a county council member was doing away with redlining — and I didn’t stop there. I've fought against housing discrimination my entire career. #DemDebate
1232481895826329600 2020-02-25 17:45:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> Gun manufacturers — if I’m elected I’m coming for you. #DemDebate
1232479020672962562 2020-02-25 17:34:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tom Steyer invested $90 million in the nation's largest private prison company — a company that allegedly hog-tied and beat kids in South Carolina. It's despicable.  President Obama and I worked to phase out private prisons — I will fight to get rid of them as president.  https://t.co/6KOxewPF2B
1232474210389225472 2020-02-25 17:15:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve worked like the devil to earn the vote of the African American community.   I don’t expect anything. I plan to earn the Black vote. And I’m here to ask for it. #DemDebate
1232473356588343297 2020-02-25 17:12:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Five. That’s how many times Senator Sanders voted AGAINST the Brady background check bill that has kept 3 million firearms out of dangerous hands.  We need a president who will stand up to the @NRA — not one who stands with them against lifesaving gun safety measures. #DemDebate
1232460769926602752 2020-02-25 16:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ban assault weapons.  Enact universal background checks.  Hold gun manufacturers accountable.  End our gun violence epidemic.
1232443153862422528 2020-02-25 15:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In 2005, I voted to allow Americans to hold gun manufacturers accountable for the death and terror they've caused in our country.   Bernie Sanders voted to let them off the hook.  https://t.co/nVMAn5xpbx
1232393895297912835 2020-02-25 11:56:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> This moment requires strong American leadership and disciplined diplomacy to lead a global response grounded in science — Donald Trump is incapable of that. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.
1232372186746220544 2020-02-25 10:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> With Donald Trump out of the way, there’s no limit to what America can achieve.
1232315563507998723 2020-02-25 06:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. We should be making voting easier — not harder.
1232119269824942080 2020-02-24 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This election is about more than just beating Donald Trump. It’s about:  - Replacing Betsy DeVos with an actual educator - Having an Attorney General who defends the Constitution, not the president - Ensuring our EPA Administrator believes climate change is an existential threat
1232110461543309312 2020-02-24 17:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Meeting Tina brightened my day — and she made a pretty good point at the end.  https://t.co/tgMPk7ISGN
1232100395658469377 2020-02-24 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our comeback started in Nevada. Now, we need your help to carry this momentum to South Carolina, Super Tuesday, and beyond.  Sign up to get involved in your community:  https://t.co/GCxsKwFY4h  https://t.co/HPgQ3O42Qq
1232085662897188864 2020-02-24 15:31:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> America’s story is full of barrier breakers who refused to accept the status quo — Katherine Johnson is among the finest. No hindrance — not racism, sexism, or even the force of gravity — was too tall a task for her. @DrBiden and I are keeping her loved ones in our hearts.
1232070730076041216 2020-02-24 14:32:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Vanessa, I'm keeping you in my prayers today. Grief is a heavy burden to bear — especially with the eyes of the world watching. But there will come a day, I promise you, when the memory of Kobe and Gianna will bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye.
1232056355529183234 2020-02-24 13:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I think Barack Obama was one hell of a President. I was proud to stand alongside him every step of the way — and fought like hell to make sure he was re-elected.  Bernie Sanders can't say the same.  https://t.co/7wM4PFUXDZ
1232047799178387456 2020-02-24 13:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I promise you that if I am elected president, we will hold gun manufacturers accountable for the carnage they have caused.  https://t.co/b1HLGdFyeF
1231975321311694849 2020-02-24 08:13:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Housing should be a right — not a privilege. But far too many Americans lack access to affordable, quality, and safe housing.   Today, I'm releasing my $640 billion plan to change that:  https://t.co/u2xzmvjDaW
1231748325411475457 2020-02-23 17:11:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the most corrupt president we’ve ever had — and the American people deserve to know what he’s hiding in his tax returns.
1231730458498461697 2020-02-23 16:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re not just trying to beat Donald Trump. We’ve got to take back the Senate, keep the House of Representatives, and unite our party.  https://t.co/mPfsp2hh7n
1231685159881203717 2020-02-23 13:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions live in fear that their health care will be taken away from them.   I promise you I will not let that happen — we will protect and build on Obamacare.  https://t.co/vyx4BaiRs7
1231662510186487808 2020-02-23 11:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who will always choose compassion over cruelty.
1231647662216077312 2020-02-23 10:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Americans aren’t looking for a handout. They’re just looking for a fair shot to get ahead. But too many people today aren’t getting that chance.  We have to rebuild the middle class — and this time, bring everyone along.  https://t.co/i3Hw5GK4WO
1231615953198145536 2020-02-23 08:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There is nothing that the United States of America can’t do if we do it together.
1231414503247687681 2020-02-22 19:04:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you, Nevada! We're headed to South Carolina but have one more request: if you can chip in a few dollars to keep our momentum going we would greatly appreciate it.  Every donation makes a big difference:  https://t.co/cTIWe94TDz  https://t.co/D1e5DOyf7s
1231406761447428098 2020-02-22 18:33:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> Despite what the press said this week, we’re alive, we’re coming back, and we’re gonna win!  https://t.co/qcwiLvJ43x
1231400785432502272 2020-02-22 18:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I ain’t a socialist.  I ain’t a plutocrat.  I’m a Democrat — and I'm proud of it.  https://t.co/c8youdmUEL
1231393660165554177 2020-02-22 17:41:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> Nevada, y’all did it for me! Thank you to all of our incredible supporters, volunteers, and organizers around the state. We couldn’t have done this without you.  Next stop: South Carolina!  https://t.co/iEE6pwSn3H
1231383672772841472 2020-02-22 17:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> While not every vote in Nevada has been counted yet, one thing is clear: our comeback starts here. Now, we’re headed to South Carolina where we’re all-in to win.   Chip in to help fuel our victory:  https://t.co/t7T5Ss4gLB
1231375012591878144 2020-02-22 16:27:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm about to take the stage from Nevada. Tune in to watch live:  https://t.co/dd0LK2fnLq
1231315222528434182 2020-02-22 12:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to all of our incredible volunteers in Nevada for all your hard work — your faith in our campaign means the world to me.  We’re taking this campaign across the country and need your help. Head to  https://t.co/r0RlGWdvLe to get involved today.  https://t.co/uA1dv5hjL3
1231294585613123584 2020-02-22 11:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Do you believe in life after Trump?  https://t.co/azZ1qZCqFW
1231272439725928448 2020-02-22 09:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s Caucus Day, Nevada! It’s time for the West to make its voice heard. Head to  https://t.co/zMsC79ZH4k to confirm your caucus location and make a plan to be there by 11:00 AM PT. Let’s win this!  https://t.co/9cvUjyriII
1231261869983199232 2020-02-22 08:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> For too many people across the country, the daily scourge of gun violence has turned normal into a living nightmare. It has to end. I’ve taken on the @NRA and won — twice. And I’ll do it again as president to end our gun violence epidemic.  https://t.co/wznJj1HfLD
1231223366511546368 2020-02-22 06:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today’s the day, Nevada! Confirm your caucus location at  https://t.co/rVHMryrt32 and make a plan to arrive by 11:00 AM PT.  https://t.co/xxC3C7nRFy
1231047205886185472 2020-02-21 18:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 was our best shot at fixing our broken immigration system. It had bipartisan support and would have put millions of immigrants on the pathway to citizenship.  Bernie Sanders voted against it.  https://t.co/7eU37Jq2RC
1231021033273954305 2020-02-21 17:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump and Stephen Miller have raised the standard of cruelty with their inhumane immigration policies. We have to get them out of the White House and ensure our laws reflect our values as a nation of immigrants.
1231008701948915712 2020-02-21 16:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tomorrow is Caucus Day in Nevada, and we need your help to bring us across the finish line. I know we’ve asked a lot lately, but if you have a few extra minutes, please head to  https://t.co/IA2o4NIaRM to talk with caucusgoers about what’s at stake. I'd greatly appreciate it.  https://t.co/T33OyMNINP
1230998887298564096 2020-02-21 15:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Vladimir Putin doesn’t want me to be President. He doesn’t want me to be our nominee. If you’re wondering why — it’s because I’m the only person in this field who’s ever gone toe-to-toe with him.
1230993099041603585 2020-02-21 15:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On day one, I will send a bill to Congress providing a roadmap to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants and take action to protect Dreamers.  https://t.co/oepf2yWDrR
1230960384347136000 2020-02-21 13:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Family separation will end on my watch — I promise you.  https://t.co/iyvrvZE2ss
1230947283191111680 2020-02-21 12:07:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> A giant among men, a civil rights hero, and a man I'm honored to call a friend — Happy Birthday, Congressman Lewis! Every day your courage inspires me like it's inspired our entire country.  https://t.co/4bHZYDNB1u
1230933959371976704 2020-02-21 11:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Experience matters. I’m the only one in this race who has gotten anything big done when it comes to health care. As president, I’ll build on Obamacare to ensure every American receives the quality, affordable care they deserve.  https://t.co/hIPeFEpFKW
1230926923183935493 2020-02-21 10:47:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> Grateful to have the support of @latinovictoryus! We can't beat Trump without a broad and diverse coalition that includes and elevates the Latino community. Together, we can win the battle for the soul of our nation.
1230916479337598978 2020-02-21 10:05:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> America's teachers and school personnel have been forced to make ends meet with too little pay and too few resources to educate our kids. That'll change in my administration.  Thank you @AFTunion and @rweingarten!
1230907739448193025 2020-02-21 09:30:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> We all have a responsibility to declare with conviction that hatred and bigotry and white supremacy have no place in America. We must give hate no safe harbor.
1230869535227596802 2020-02-21 06:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history. We need to get him out of the White House and restore honor and dignity to the presidency.  https://t.co/K6lz4Ueagp
1230702055720808458 2020-02-20 19:53:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Americans — not Vladimir Putin — should decide our elections.  https://t.co/vwHk1ELdjF
1230685572714418176 2020-02-20 18:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We had a great night at tonight's CNN town hall — and with just two days until the Nevada caucuses, we need your help to keep our momentum going. Every dollar goes a long way during this critical stretch. Chip in today:  https://t.co/Y8rEQnFhTc
1230677552039186432 2020-02-20 18:16:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve sat there and looked in the eyes of parents who lost their kids to gun violence. They want to be able to sue these gun manufacturers. We should let them.  https://t.co/thL9G6IPvy
1230657890161004544 2020-02-20 16:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Alex, a law enforcement officer and former Marine from Reno, supports common-sense gun safety reform — just like the majority of America. Here’s why he’s supporting our campaign:  https://t.co/BAM6qFjHzs
1230655877092384770 2020-02-20 16:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm about to take the stage for tonight's town hall in Las Vegas, Nevada. Tune in to @CNN at 8 PM ET to watch live.
1230649585640574978 2020-02-20 16:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be clear: Mayor Bloomberg should release folks from their non-disclosure agreements. This is about transparency. The American people deserve to know the truth.  https://t.co/IdRmpGpumm
1230633227661955073 2020-02-20 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The campaign trail is ruff without these two by my side. #LoveYourPetDay  https://t.co/opFxSKorox
1230619946306211847 2020-02-20 14:27:13 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to take on the @NRA and pass real reform to end our gun violence epidemic. That starts with universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons, and holding gun manufacturers accountable.  I've beaten the gun lobby twice — and I'll do it again as president.
1230619945110769665 2020-02-20 14:27:13 -0800 <JoeBiden> We fall into the same pattern every time: a senseless act of violence occurs, politicians offer “thoughts and prayers,” and calls for reform fade away until the next tragedy inevitably occurs.  I’m sick and tired of saying “enough is enough.” We can’t go on like this any longer.
1230619943730896898 2020-02-20 14:27:13 -0800 <JoeBiden> Last night’s debate took place blocks away from the site of the deadliest mass shooting in American history — where a lone gunman took 58 precious lives and injured hundreds of others. Yet there were zero questions about how we end our gun violence epidemic. It was unacceptable.
1230603028853596161 2020-02-20 13:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s simple: If you like your private health insurance plan, you should be able to keep it. If you don’t like it, you should be able to choose a new public option.  That’s the choice my administration will give every American — and we’ll do it without raising middle class taxes.  https://t.co/pQ8LjknasW
1230564205616517121 2020-02-20 10:45:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump thinks the media is the enemy of the people. He's dead wrong.  America’s commitment to free press, free speech, and free expression should never waver, and certainly not in the face of Chinese authoritarianism. We've got to stand up for these freedoms at home and abroad.
1230539861343506432 2020-02-20 09:08:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in a climate emergency — and every day that Donald Trump remains in the White House further threatens the future of our planet.
1230501756741783554 2020-02-20 06:37:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's time to hold gun manufacturers accountable.  https://t.co/2qxmd55x9C
1230365966573293569 2020-02-19 21:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Action can’t wait when it comes to gun safety reform, health care, and immigration. We need a leader with the proven ability to unite the country and get big things done.  https://t.co/j2tm7WXw42
1230361636877275136 2020-02-19 21:20:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m feeling good about what’s to come for our campaign in Nevada, South Carolina and beyond. I could use your help to keep this momentum going.   Chip in what you can, it’ll make a big difference for our campaign:  https://t.co/xqG2nvU7t5  https://t.co/kzJH26LDFl
1230342228368904192 2020-02-19 20:03:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve been knocked down a whole hell of a lot. But I know how to get back up. We have to get up and provide safety and security for the American people. #DemDebate
1230339806938517510 2020-02-19 19:54:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know a lot of folks want to write our campaign off right now, but tonight is showing that we're just getting started. We need your help to make the most of tonight's debate.  Chip in to keep our momentum going:  https://t.co/A70UZ0ny55
1230332953395376129 2020-02-19 19:26:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> Whether you’re in the Oval Office or on our party’s debate stage: racial profiling is wrong. Period. #DemDebate  https://t.co/eeBqyEU9LB
1230329979658915841 2020-02-19 19:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You can sue tobacco companies.   You can sue pharmaceutical companies.  The only companies you can’t sue are gun manufacturers because of a law Bernie Sanders voted for. #DemDebate
1230327966636421120 2020-02-19 19:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I visited the Techren solar facility. Let me tell you: Nevada gets it. Solar facilities like this one are powering our transition to clean energy and creating jobs in the process. We've got to transition to a clean energy economy. #DemDebate  https://t.co/Go3jYCqz1f
1230318973742387200 2020-02-19 18:31:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> Obamacare was and is a big deal. The law:  - Covered 20 million additional Americans - Protects over 100 million with pre-existing conditions - Allows young people to stay on their parents’ plans until age 26  Mike Bloomberg calls that “a disgrace.” I call it progress. #DemDebate  https://t.co/2uFOJf2kBd
1230318507008589824 2020-02-19 18:29:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> Lots of people on stage talked about health care tonight. I’m the only one who’s gotten anything done. #DemDebate
1230314564987838464 2020-02-19 18:13:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> At the height of Michael Bloomberg’s Stop-and-Frisk program:  - 685,724 people were stopped - Nearly 80% were black or latino - Nearly 90% were innocent.  He defended it as recently as this year. Who does he think he’s fooling? #DemDebate
1230314049864421376 2020-02-19 18:11:42 -0800 <JoeBiden> NBC did a poll the other day. Who did it say the best person to beat Donald Trump was?   Me. #DemDebate
1230294747501064192 2020-02-19 16:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The stakes of this election couldn’t be higher — we have to beat Donald Trump, and we only get one chance to do it. Poll after poll shows I’m the best candidate to get the job done.  https://t.co/EKWyeQAsoR
1230277131726413824 2020-02-19 15:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> "In important things like flying or the running of a nation, experience makes the difference between success and failure." — Captain "Sully" Sullenberger  The White House is no place for on-the-job training. We need a president who will be ready on day one.  https://t.co/IF17cwXud9
1230251966003130369 2020-02-19 14:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I've taken on the @NRA and beaten them — twice. And I'll do it again as president because everyone should need to pass a background check to buy a gun.  https://t.co/Ti2iuhC1Hx
1230207883721179136 2020-02-19 11:09:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> I don’t endorse Republicans.
1230174235471089666 2020-02-19 08:56:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Welcome to the debates, Mike. We have a lot to catch up on about Barack Obama’s record.  https://t.co/bMYPLYwnfQ
1230145262955499521 2020-02-19 07:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know that these past few years have felt like a constant crisis. But this moment is more than a crisis — it’s also an extraordinary opportunity. It’s a chance for us to come back together as a nation to reassert the values that define us as Americans.
1229938651171155968 2020-02-18 17:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let's be clear: Weapons of war have no place in our communities.  That's why I took on the @NRA and passed a 10-year ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines — and I'll do it again as president.  https://t.co/hMQvuuXtNv
1229923551563722758 2020-02-18 16:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> With just four days until the Nevada caucuses, there’s no time to waste. We need your help to make our final case to voters across the state. Every donation makes a big difference during this critical stretch.  Chip in to bring us across the finish line:  https://t.co/9dgAOwWnZo
1229893855836659712 2020-02-18 14:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The abuse of power is the defining characteristic of Donald Trump’s presidency — and Attorney General William Barr has helped facilitate it. He should resign immediately.  https://t.co/FEaNfL3ZIB
1229871842627858434 2020-02-18 12:54:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> North Carolina's voter ID law was never designed to protect the sacred right to vote. It was designed to prevent people of color from voting.  I applaud today's ruling, but our fight to make it easier for all Americans to vote is far from over.
1229854345736355845 2020-02-18 11:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today is the last day to early vote, Nevada! Confirm your polling location at  https://t.co/bBA5wBFmh3 and head to the polls to make your voice heard.  https://t.co/E3iKrRiy9C
1229842517677441024 2020-02-18 10:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Obama asked me to oversee the Recovery Act, which saved our economy from a depression. I secured the 3 Republicans we needed to vote for it—and ran the program with almost no waste. We didn’t inherit a growing economy—we worked for it. That's what I'll do as President.  https://t.co/U8eDUZKywk
1229810305313591296 2020-02-18 08:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Donald Trump:   - Fans the flames of hate and emboldens white supremacists - Embraces dictators - Rips children from their parents' arms - Spouts racist lies about immigrants  We have to get him out of the White House.
1229767524880932865 2020-02-18 06:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Faith is what has gotten me through difficult times in my life. It provides hope, purpose, and strength. And it is what gives me the reason to believe that our nation's best days still lie ahead.  https://t.co/DM7g95aV8k
1229584698843836417 2020-02-17 17:53:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@Cher — thanks for the kind words. I’m in Vegas this week. Let me know if you need an opener!  https://t.co/zKKoyC10nU

1229567455430938624 2020-02-17 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On #PresidentsDay, we remember the leaders who showed strength in moments of fear, who brought us together in moments of division, and showed empathy in moments of pain.  Then we remember that today, our President is Donald Trump. In November, let's end this chapter of history.
1229553613959118848 2020-02-17 15:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Nevada — you can early vote now! Don't wait until Saturday to make your voice heard, head to  https://t.co/dEkUX3cYbe to confirm your polling location and early vote today.  https://t.co/9d8OmZ0Vr7
1229523414953553921 2020-02-17 13:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> At a time when the president is fanning the flames of white supremacy and hatred in our country, we cannot discount the voices of those who have the most at stake in this election.  https://t.co/1SgzJ8H1ya
1229494474423836672 2020-02-17 11:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Americans should decide American elections. Period. House Democrats took action to protect our elections from foreign interference — it’s time Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans do the same.  https://t.co/ZjKZyL4KvX
1229457985488986117 2020-02-17 09:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe the best way forward is to build on Obamacare with a Medicare-like public option for every single American who wants it. It's the best way to achieve universal coverage without raising taxes on the middle class. Read more:  https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C
1229419983353991168 2020-02-17 06:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who puts protecting our children ahead of the @NRA.  https://t.co/8i7LQrISzw
1229201292368760833 2020-02-16 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are so much better than Donald Trump.
1229178644557389824 2020-02-16 15:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I need your help if we're going to beat Donald Trump and restore the soul of this nation. With the Nevada caucuses less than one week away, your donation is more important than ever. Chip in today:  https://t.co/IoLdFQvOYB
1229161027037777923 2020-02-16 13:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You know better than anybody else what works best for your family. That’s why my health care plan starts with a choice: you can stick with private coverage, including quality plans that unions have negotiated, or you can go with a new public option.  https://t.co/ERnMuoqJBX
1229129569753497601 2020-02-16 11:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve got the record and the vision to get big things done for America.  https://t.co/YVxJq9oLhR
1229103397539704832 2020-02-16 10:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Newtown Parkland Las Vegas  Enough is enough. We have to take on the @NRA and end our gun violence epidemic.  https://t.co/2f9h6AMSeZ
1229077224847863808 2020-02-16 08:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are the United States of America. We are strong and great because of our diversity — not in spite of it. Donald Trump doesn't get that. We need a president who does.
1228837646300041216 2020-02-15 16:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump’s inhumane, fear-based immigration policies are a stain on our nation. We have to get him out of the White House and ensure our laws reflect our values as a nation of immigrants.
1228824308387958784 2020-02-15 15:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Nevada — early voting starts today! Head to  https://t.co/bBA5wBnKSt to find all the info you need to make your voice heard.  https://t.co/HU9Niu6J68

1228744533107671041 2020-02-15 10:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No one needs an AR-15. Period. We have to get these weapons of war out of our communities.

1228477020012601344 2020-02-14 16:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Wanted to make sure you saw this, @realDonaldTrump: “Trump’s First 3 Years Created 1.5 Million Fewer Jobs Than Obama’s Last 3.”  https://t.co/KWoHe1d4ku
1228451350859501574 2020-02-14 14:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Two years ago, 17 innocent people were gunned down and 17 more injured by a shooter with an AR-15 style weapon at a high school in Parkland, FL. As we honor the memory of those we lost, we must recommit to taking action to end our gun violence epidemic.  https://t.co/JQz9ptTqaj
1228440026532450304 2020-02-14 14:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Happy Valentine’s Day, Jilly. You're the love of my life and the life of my love.  https://t.co/AUVHeSAI1U
1228435930169663489 2020-02-14 13:48:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> Rep. @StevenHorsford has been a champion for labor, and for the state of Nevada. I’m proud to have his support as we head toward the Nevada caucuses.
1228429959955267584 2020-02-14 13:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the face of unspeakable tragedy, the students and parents of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have turned grief into purpose. Their courage and resolve inspires me every day — and I know that with their leadership, we will end our gun violence epidemic.  https://t.co/U0xLWBh2ag
1228414914286563330 2020-02-14 12:25:13 -0800 <JoeBiden> The United States Attorney General is not your private attorney, Mr. President. There are limits to your power.
1228395986038296576 2020-02-14 11:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Too often, Black and Brown voters’ loyalty, support, and commitment to the Democratic Party are taken for granted. I’ve never taken it for granted — and I never will.  The strength of our party is its diversity. We need to be sure every voice is heard.  https://t.co/TMhEZt6HEs
1228122937099739136 2020-02-13 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America is full of possibilities. With Donald Trump out of the White House, we can:  - Solve the climate crisis - Rebuild the middle class - Make health care a right - Ensure our government works for all — not just the powerful
1228111612101328896 2020-02-13 16:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Where I come from, I don’t like people telling me what I have to choose — that’s why my plan will give people the option to keep their existing plan or buy into a new Medicare-like public option. In contrast, Medicare for All eliminates private and union insurance plans.  https://t.co/LV6Ovsn0sN
1228091503643365377 2020-02-13 15:00:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> Antarctica is facing extreme ice loss. Sea levels and temperatures are rising around the world. Yet Donald Trump continues to deny the evidence in front of his own eyes.  We need to take action to solve the climate crisis—and that starts with getting Trump out of the White House.
1228065055431786496 2020-02-13 13:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I have said from the day I announced that we’re in a battle for the soul of this nation. That is even more true today. We have a president who has been sending dog whistles of encouragement and support to white supremacists and hate groups.  We have to beat Donald Trump.
1228046432885596160 2020-02-13 12:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve released 21 years of my tax returns — why hasn’t Donald Trump released his?  He is the most corrupt president we’ve ever had.  https://t.co/aWI3e1lVko
1228038063902920710 2020-02-13 11:27:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> I will nominate and appoint federal officials and judges who look just like the rest of America, including the AAPI community. I will build on the Obama-Biden Administration’s efforts to ensure that everyone has a voice in a Biden Administration. #AAPI2020
1228004657936707588 2020-02-13 09:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Obamacare covered 20 million additional Americans, protects over 100 million people with pre-existing conditions, and allows young people to stay on their parents' plans until age 26.  We shouldn't tear all that down and start over — we should protect and build on it.
1227776906793107456 2020-02-12 18:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me be clear: the fight to end Donald Trump's presidency is just beginning.  https://t.co/U7YzD9rnW0
1227764323801423872 2020-02-12 17:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we give Donald Trump four more years in the White House, he will fundamentally alter the character of this nation. We can’t stand by and let that happen.  https://t.co/yu71fRAXgl

1227729330584854534 2020-02-12 15:00:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> I stand with the working men and women of @Culinary226 because supporting labor means supporting our unions.   https://t.co/iNq6AVGww5
1227697634434932736 2020-02-12 12:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@AndrewYang is a leading voice about the challenges of the fourth industrial revolution. He brought fun and new ideas to the race. I'm grateful for it, and hope we hear more from him regarding how to ensure workers succeed in an era of increasing automation.
1227687568440848384 2020-02-12 12:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Under Donald Trump:  - Job growth has slowed - Manufacturing is worse off - Income inequality is higher than ever  He is squandering the growing Obama-Biden economy that he inherited — just like he has squandered everything else that he has inherited in his life.
1227670203791814657 2020-02-12 11:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm looking forward to seeing @MichaelBennet continue the fight to unify our nation, and beat Donald Trump, in the Senate — Coloradans are lucky to have him in their corner.
1227639753820033025 2020-02-12 09:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who chooses unity over division. If we come together and unite this country, there’s nothing we can’t do.
1227599641816059905 2020-02-12 06:25:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> Nobody told me the road would be easy, but together we can and will win.  https://t.co/vVtykPfJse
1227441697862246400 2020-02-11 19:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 99.9% — that’s the percentage of African-American voters who have not yet had a chance to vote in this nomination process. You cannot and should not win the Democratic nomination for President without the support of black and brown voters.
1227435909961961473 2020-02-11 19:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Iowa and New Hampshire were just the beginning. Now, we’re taking this campaign to Nevada and South Carolina, and we have to give it all we’ve got. Chip in to help power our campaign through this crucial stretch:  https://t.co/OzTj8NbUGl
1227429618497544192 2020-02-11 19:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to all of our incredible supporters, volunteers, and staff in New Hampshire! Your hard work and faith in our campaign mean the world to me. Now, we’re headed to Nevada, South Carolina, and beyond.
1227417485386715136 2020-02-11 18:21:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe's about to take the stage from South Carolina. Tune in to watch live:  https://t.co/aGEAMOrBSq
1227371736984772608 2020-02-11 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Mandela was no ordinary man. When he stepped out of prison 30 years ago today, he immediately resumed his life's work to end apartheid. He showed us that trust and reconciliation are possible, delivering justice for his people.
1227352863099277312 2020-02-11 14:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There has been a lot of veiled criticism of the Obama-Biden record lately, so let me be clear about something: Barack Obama was a great president. We don’t say that enough.  https://t.co/a5R0hMxOMX
1227346434661462019 2020-02-11 13:39:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you for standing with me, @IBEW. I'll fight alongside you every single day in the White House to strengthen America's unions and rebuild the middle class.
1227332730041425921 2020-02-11 12:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today’s the day — it’s primary day in New Hampshire!  Head to  https://t.co/37BiAB9xTK to make calls into the Granite State from wherever you are in the country to help get voters to the polls.
1227301272572710917 2020-02-11 10:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. If we want to win, it’s going to take everyone stepping up and making their voice heard.

1227059996174753793 2020-02-10 18:41:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is proposing cuts to Medicaid, Obamacare, and food assistance — while protecting giant tax giveaways to corporations and the super-wealthy. He has once again proved how morally unfit he is to lead our country.
1227042064816365574 2020-02-10 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump will say over and over that the economy is on the ballot this year. It is. But America’s character is on the ballot too. And despite what Trump says, we don’t have to choose one or the other.  We can be a good country with a good economy.  https://t.co/VKxpWqMeHg
1227026965917364226 2020-02-10 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The New Hampshire primary is just one day away, and we need your help to talk with folks about what’s at stake in this election. Head to  https://t.co/37BiAB9xTK to make calls into New Hampshire from wherever you are in the country.
1227019667497111552 2020-02-10 16:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I've always said you shouldn't let the barriers in life define you. Brayden sure as hell didn't let them define him. I'm proud to be a part of his story:  https://t.co/2udsXfsCfy
1226984183165157376 2020-02-10 13:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> With just one day until the New Hampshire primary, we’re hard at work making our final case to voters — and we need your help. Chip in today to help us deliver our closing argument to as many Granite Staters as possible:  https://t.co/hWl9p6lqQ4
1226948951326113792 2020-02-10 11:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president with the courage to stand up to the @NRA and pass common-sense gun safety measures — not one with a long record of siding with the gun lobby.  https://t.co/q4ttyVjdVt
1226925043747131393 2020-02-10 09:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Experience matters. The White House is no place for on-the-job training. We need a president who will be prepared to clean up Donald Trump’s mess on day one.
1226677160103960576 2020-02-09 17:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I've lost a lot in my life, but I'll be damned if I'm going to stand by and lose my country too. We have to beat Donald Trump.
1226671623845093376 2020-02-09 16:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know there are a lot of folks who want to write our campaign off already — but I’ve got news for them: We’re not going anywhere. There's too much at stake in this election.  I will fight for every last vote, but I can't do it without you. Chip in today:  https://t.co/hTbAPI8Nkq
1226643988209426432 2020-02-09 15:08:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> There are just two days until the first-in-the-nation primary, and we need your help to bring us across the finish line. If you have a few minutes, head to  https://t.co/66UCpVP0jc to talk with New Hampshire voters about what's at stake in this election. I’d greatly appreciate it.  https://t.co/bLSiQfDehY
1226630980410249222 2020-02-09 14:16:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s not enough to just end Citizens United — we have to eliminate all private dollars from our federal elections.  It's time we return our democracy to the people.
1226591300465590272 2020-02-09 11:38:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in a climate emergency. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and treat climate change like the existential threat that it is — before it's too late.
1226573981571923968 2020-02-09 10:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Rebuilding the middle class and ensuring that this time everyone comes along starts with one word: unions. That’s why I look forward to signing the #PROAct as President. Congratulations to the House and labor movement for passing this landmark bill.
1226559384190210049 2020-02-09 09:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> #TeamJoe has been hard at work talking with folks in every corner of New Hampshire — but it all comes down to this final push. Every conversation will make a big difference on Tuesday. Sign up to volunteer today:  https://t.co/8qV24014Y7
1226283315117748226 2020-02-08 15:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When it comes to expanding access to more affordable health care, Americans like Charlene can't wait. I'm the only candidate in this race who has passed a big, bold health care reform bill — and I'll do it again in the White House.  https://t.co/7uq8qftn0V
1226236758507040770 2020-02-08 12:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump does not deserve to be commander in chief for one more day.  https://t.co/nksx4dBBh3
1226189752598171648 2020-02-08 09:03:13 -0800 <JoeBiden> Former Mayor Pete doesn’t think very highly of the Obama-Biden record. Let’s compare.  https://t.co/132TB7MHaq
1226001457935245312 2020-02-07 20:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I just wrapped up tonight's #DemDebate, and I need your help to keep this momentum going. Every donation makes a big difference. Chip in today:  https://t.co/mKh1hKqzJr  https://t.co/op9BaD4RYE
1225988874888982530 2020-02-07 19:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Lt. Col. Vindman is an American patriot. #DemDebate  https://t.co/ZOU4SDKTEe
1225985526626422784 2020-02-07 19:31:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> With just four days until New Hampshire voters head to the polls, there’s no time to waste. We need your help to keep the momentum going from tonight’s #DemDebate. Chip in $5 to help power our campaign through this crucial stretch:  https://t.co/GAlB0S4lQ6
1225970048113762304 2020-02-07 18:30:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> Five.  That’s how many times Senator Sanders voted against the Brady background check bill that has kept 3 million firearms out of dangerous hands.  I helped pass it.  We need a president who'll stand up to the @NRA — not stand with them against lifesaving gun safety measures.
1225967389172551680 2020-02-07 18:19:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> The United States must keep our commitments when we make them, otherwise we have no power to lead the world. The only way to not become the police of the world is to have allies that will join us in dealing with failed states and terrorism. #DemDebate
1225965333741293568 2020-02-07 18:11:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> The best path forward on health care is to protect and build on Obamacare — not tear it down and start over. #DemDebate  https://t.co/xXoYjc2BOb
1225963586197086208 2020-02-07 18:04:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> As President, I will use military power responsibly and as a last resort. We will not go back to forever wars in the Middle East. #DemDebate
1225961646994206722 2020-02-07 17:56:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump called our troops’ traumatic brain injuries “headaches.”   If my son had still been there in Iraq, I’d have been so damn angry.   Donald Trump does not deserve to be commander in chief for one more day. #DemDebate
1225958806221467648 2020-02-07 17:45:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump should have been pinning a medal on Lt. Col. Vindman — not Rush Limbaugh. #DemDebate
1225954446640865280 2020-02-07 17:28:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> I led the Obama-Biden Administration’s efforts to pass and implement the Recovery Act, which saved the American economy from another depression and sent South Bend, IN, over $75 million to invest in projects around the town.  Projects that Mayor Pete likes to take credit for.  https://t.co/FQOusAA3Ac
1225953838043148288 2020-02-07 17:25:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> One of the most important issues we face as a nation is ensuring affordable, accessible health care. There's work to do, but that doesn't mean starting from scratch. It means protecting and building on Obamacare. #DemDebate  https://t.co/7J4nC6ZUGX
1225952696332673025 2020-02-07 17:21:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to get real about health care. The American people deserve the truth and an explanation of what Medicare for All will cost — not political games. #DemDebate  https://t.co/V6wZViZoXA
1225950017883713536 2020-02-07 17:10:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re not only going to have to win the White House but we have to bring along the United States Senate. We can’t do that with someone who labels themselves as a Democratic Socialist. #DemDebate
1225938787513049088 2020-02-07 16:25:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m incredibly proud of Brayden for sharing his story on national TV. He is truly a remarkable young man — and I can’t wait to see what his future holds.  https://t.co/nN9ZFIAJ0W
1225916592116113410 2020-02-07 14:57:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> No corporation pulling in billions of dollars in profits should pay a lower tax rate than our teachers and firefighters. It’s time corporations pay their fair share.
1225883178839220224 2020-02-07 12:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Who in God's name needs a weapon that can hold one hundred rounds? These weapons of war have no place in our communities. I’ve taken on the @NRA to ban them once before, and I’ll do it again in the White House.  https://t.co/JPFMzM1kcB
1225854238015852544 2020-02-07 10:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're just four days from the first-in-the-nation primary in New Hampshire, and we need all hands on deck to talk with voters before they head to the polls. Head to  https://t.co/37BiABr9ik to make calls to New Hampshire voters from wherever you are in the country.
1225826865715335170 2020-02-07 09:01:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> When I met Brayden this week, he had a familiar anxiety on his face. It was the anxiety of a kid with a stutter, something I struggled to overcome when I was a kid too. Here's what I told him.  https://t.co/IIF386n2GU
1225596934318120960 2020-02-06 17:47:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who chooses compassion over cruelty.
1225573639149563907 2020-02-06 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s not hyperbole to say that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Everything that makes us who we are is at stake. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and take back this country.
1225539916743860224 2020-02-06 14:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Empathy matters. Compassion matters. We have to reach out to one another and heal this country — and that’s what I’ll do as president.  https://t.co/XVDnUc32Ij
1225521202292236288 2020-02-06 12:46:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> John DiEleuterio had a huge heart and was a friend I counted on for over 50 years. As a Colonel in the National Guard and as the State Director in my Senate office, John served our country with dignity and distinction. Jill and I send our condolences to Maureen and his family.
1225490591670292480 2020-02-06 10:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I firmly believe America's best days still lie ahead. If we come together and unite this country, there's not a single thing we can't do.
1225460939224485888 2020-02-06 08:47:10 -0800 <JoeBiden> Grace - I've said it before and I'll say it again: LGBTQ rights are civil rights. It's an honor to work for you and in service of justice for every American in this country.  https://t.co/8eegCp3ffS
1225277448755040258 2020-02-05 20:38:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let's be real about health care. You gotta level with the American people. Tell them the truth, what you think it's gonna cost and how you're gonna get it done.  https://t.co/37aeT57Thz
1225261447187456002 2020-02-05 19:34:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> I grew up with a stutter. At tonight’s @CNN town hall, I was asked what advice I would give to those working to overcome their own — here’s what I said:  https://t.co/M0obXY0s6d
1225245095731040256 2020-02-05 18:29:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, @DougJones stood up and did the right thing. He showed courage on the Senate floor, when many did not.   The only way we will defeat Trump now is to keep strong Democrats in the Senate—and a strong campaign at the top of the ticket. Chip in today:  https://t.co/ekhjoBDayi
1225218800867594242 2020-02-05 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Looking forward to discussing what’s at stake in this election and my bold vision for the future of our country at tonight’s town hall in New Hampshire. Tune in to @CNN at 8 PM ET to watch live.
1225205970495733760 2020-02-05 15:54:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Only Donald Trump could debase our nation's highest civilian honor and turn it into a partisan political prop.
1225177528890884096 2020-02-05 14:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My North Star as president will be rebuilding the middle class. And this time, we're going to bring everyone along regardless of race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability.  https://t.co/TyiYGD8D0y
1225152126613118981 2020-02-05 12:20:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> Fred, it must not have been easy to sit there and listen to @realdonaldtrump lie. I’m proud of you for speaking truth to the abuse of power.
1225111846207684608 2020-02-05 09:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mayor Pete likes to call me part of the old failed Washington. Was it a failure when I helped pass Obamacare, the Paris Agreement, the Violence Against Women Act, or the assault weapons ban?  I have a stronger record of passing big, progressive legislation than anyone running.
1225093223221059584 2020-02-05 08:26:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Last night, President Trump turned his constitutional obligation to inform Congress about the state of our union into an episode of reality television. It was a shameful display. #SOTU
1224892644456828929 2020-02-04 19:08:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our administration brought the economy back from the brink of depression, saved the auto industry, and made health care available to millions of families.  Donald Trump gave billionaires a tax break.
1224848863242018816 2020-02-04 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Rosa Parks helped ignite a movement that changed the course of history. Let’s carry on her legacy by continuing to push our nation to finally live up to our highest ideals. We can’t rest until we achieve liberty, justice, and equality for all. #RosaParksDay
1224833785369415680 2020-02-04 15:15:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> Caroline has served her country with the utmost distinction both at home and abroad. I'm honored to have her support as we head into New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina.
1224807339691212800 2020-02-04 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The fight against cancer is personal for me — like it is for so many people. And it's a fight we must win. With the incredible breakthroughs we've made in recent years — and with so many just over the horizon — I'm confident that we will end cancer as we know it. #WorldCancerDay
1224735271222235136 2020-02-04 08:43:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@ATUcomm has been integral to the labor movement and putting our country on a path towards lifting the middle class. We've got a long campaign ahead of us, and I'm thrilled to have the support of my friend John Costa and the hard-working members of ATU with me.
1224569522461405184 2020-02-03 21:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Iowa was just the first step. Now, we’re taking this campaign to the rest of the country, and we need your help to do it. I know we’ve asked a lot these last nine months, but there's never been a more crucial time for our campaign. Chip in today:  https://t.co/sb6EUIcnyx
1224566502726230017 2020-02-03 21:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Everybody knows who Donald Trump is — it’s time we show them who we are. We choose:   Hope over fear.  Science over fiction.  Unity over division. Compassion over cruelty.  Truth over lies.
1224564992499838976 2020-02-03 21:27:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who is not only ready to fight but is also ready to heal this country — and that’s exactly what I’ll do as president. There’s nothing we’ve been unable to do when we do it together.
1224556945073491968 2020-02-03 20:55:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> I want to thank our incredible supporters and volunteers in Iowa — and all across the country. Now, it’s onto New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, and beyond!  https://t.co/PRwO2rieJ4
1224550895205007360 2020-02-03 20:30:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe's about to take the stage in Des Moines, Iowa. Tune in to watch live:  https://t.co/x7RDw4dS17
1224490250484973568 2020-02-03 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Iowa — if you’re in line at your caucus location by 7 PM CT, you can caucus!  https://t.co/oQ2918WP95
1224477667149221888 2020-02-03 15:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America's character is on the ballot. I don't believe we're the dark, angry nation we see in Donald Trump's tweets — we are so much better than who he thinks we are.
1224463825987981316 2020-02-03 14:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Imagine all the progress we can make in the next four years. With Donald Trump out of the way, we can make affordable health care a right, lead the fight on climate change, and ban assault weapons.  It's all possible. And it starts tonight in Iowa.  https://t.co/Zf0Z0q6Sp1
1224451243109691392 2020-02-03 13:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In a few hours, Iowans will gather around the state to set our nation on the path to picking the next president. It’s a big responsibility—and we need everyone on #TeamJoe to show up and make their voices heard. Head to  https://t.co/3HaA5wLv2M to confirm your caucus location.  https://t.co/lHozVyO6i9
1224434885454127104 2020-02-03 12:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The next president will inherit a country divided — and a world in disarray. There will be no time for on-the-job training.  We need a president who is ready on day one.
1224414753981902855 2020-02-03 11:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The stakes of this election could not be higher. We only have one chance to beat Donald Trump — and we need a nominee who can get the job done.  https://t.co/N1yrARZHvc
1224384554301054983 2020-02-03 09:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Caucus Day is here, Iowa! Head to  https://t.co/3HaA5wLv2M to confirm your caucus location and plan to show up by 6:30 PM CT. I hope I can count on your support — because together we can beat Donald Trump, unite this country, and win the battle for the soul of this nation.  https://t.co/ZM0aET6rW7
1224362156336001031 2020-02-03 08:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s caucus day in Iowa, and we need your help to bring us across the finish line. If you have a few extra minutes, head to  https://t.co/0OADrrjdo9 to make calls into Iowa. I’d greatly appreciate it. Let’s finish strong.  https://t.co/rA1MXti3L2
1224324157065789440 2020-02-03 05:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We choose:  Hope over fear. Unity over division.  Truth over lies.   Our nation’s character is on the ballot, Iowa. Tonight, let’s show them who we really are.  https://t.co/GU5pUGcCHE
1224307797908738049 2020-02-03 04:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today’s the day, Iowa! Confirm your caucus location at  https://t.co/3HaA5wLv2M and make a plan to arrive by 6:30 PM CT.  https://t.co/vmzNwW1Kro
1224137928458166272 2020-02-02 17:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can beat Donald Trump. We can unite this country. We can restore the soul of this nation.  It all begins tomorrow night in Iowa.  https://t.co/Lhj8CSmOZG
1224121570999689217 2020-02-02 16:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When we launched this campaign, I said we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. That battle begins tomorrow night in Iowa—and requires everyone stepping up and making their voice heard. If you’re with me, let me know by committing to caucus today:  https://t.co/OFXDjKF5uI
1224110246223695873 2020-02-02 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My values are rooted in the American character: tough, resilient, but always full of hope. We need a president who appeals to the best in us and unites this nation — because if we come together, there’s not a single thing we can’t do.  https://t.co/t8qkivIL48
1224093888387792897 2020-02-02 14:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is the final stretch — the Iowa caucuses are just one day away and we need your help to keep the momentum going. Every phone call and every conversation will make a big difference tomorrow night. Head to  https://t.co/0OADrrAOfH to make calls into Iowa. Let’s get to work.  https://t.co/ZNUfpBg2B8
1224071239267831808 2020-02-02 12:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When I say we need to restore the soul of the nation, I’m not talking about taking us back to an America that never existed—but propelling us forward to a place we’ve never been. Where we finally live up to our highest ideals and everyone gets a full share of the American dream.
1224049848254713857 2020-02-02 11:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve never been more optimistic about the future of America. There’s not a single thing we can’t do if we do it together.  https://t.co/u4ZVMv31P0
1224028457182490624 2020-02-02 09:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> #TeamJoe has been hard at work making phone calls, knocking doors, and talking with as many folks as possible over the last nine months—but it all comes down to these last few days. We need all hands on deck for this final push. Sign up to volunteer today:  https://t.co/mwJBZkb34x  https://t.co/OP2UVH0zaD
1224005306721677314 2020-02-02 08:23:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Iowa caucus is tomorrow night, it’s time to make your plan! Caucusing is fun and easy — and making a plan only takes a few minutes. Head to  https://t.co/OezAqUfIOF to make sure you’re all set.  https://t.co/gzExf4lb0v
1223807268703043588 2020-02-01 19:16:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump further diminished the U.S. in the eyes of the world by expanding his travel ban. This new “African Ban,” is designed to make it harder for black and brown people to immigrate to the United States. It’s a disgrace, and we cannot let him succeed.  https://t.co/oePD5eSAWY
1223774515320193025 2020-02-01 17:05:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> America was founded on the ideals of equality, equity, and fairness—we've never fully lived up to them, but we've never stopped trying. During #BlackHistoryMonth and all year-round, let's celebrate the rich history and culture that's always been vital to the fabric of America.  https://t.co/FNYM1O6CMm
1223747858316386306 2020-02-01 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Health care is on the ballot. We need to protect Obamacare from Donald Trump’s relentless attempts to repeal and sabotage it — and build on the law to ensure every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable care.  https://t.co/KlbtBOASNU
1223727977361338370 2020-02-01 14:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.
1223708851503030272 2020-02-01 12:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Iowa caucus is just two days away, and we need your help to talk with as many folks as possible before Monday night. Head to  https://t.co/0OADrrjdo9 to make calls into Iowa from wherever you are in the country.
1223693751740010496 2020-02-01 11:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> From my childhood in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to the halls of the White House — the middle-class values of hard work, respect, and decency have guided my entire life. It's time we brought those values back to the Oval Office.  https://t.co/QUXgb4ghzm
1223669844211458048 2020-02-01 10:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Iowa Caucus is just days away and polls show us in a dead heat. I'm confident that we can compete and that we'll go on to beat Donald Trump—but we need your help to do it.  Every dollar makes a big difference—chip in to bring us across the finish line:  https://t.co/LXqZm6avjZ  https://t.co/MMU0cI7qLm
1223640903761317888 2020-02-01 08:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America's farmers deserve better than four more years of Donald Trump's empty rhetoric and broken promises.  https://t.co/SCUVSM7EQx
1223418186218913792 2020-01-31 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to restore the soul of this nation, build an inclusive middle class, and unite the country to get big things done. That all starts Monday night in Iowa. If you’re with me, let me know by committing to caucus today:  https://t.co/OBEKRgsD0K
1223403087089434624 2020-01-31 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> With just three days until Iowa, we need all hands on deck to talk with folks about what’s at stake in this election. Every conversation during this final stretch will make a big difference on Monday night. Sign up to volunteer today:  https://t.co/WaszTPqVUh  https://t.co/CU5D8Mr1W9
1223390503527469056 2020-01-31 15:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America's character is on the ballot. We can overcome four years of Donald Trump, but if given eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation. We can't let that happen.  https://t.co/TnQrX0hCUi
1223375404351787008 2020-01-31 14:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump's Muslim ban is a direct betrayal of America’s most fundamental freedom: religious freedom. And now he's adding more countries to his list of who's not welcome in America.  It's not who we are — and we'll prove that when we beat Trump this November and end the ban.  https://t.co/qdlU5P7MZQ
1223351496877793280 2020-01-31 13:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I've stood up to bullies my entire life, and I'm ready to stand up to the one in the White House. I hope President Trump heard that message loud and clear when he saw this ad air during Fox &amp; Friends this morning.  https://t.co/TImcrK1T48
1223323814290870272 2020-01-31 11:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Time and time again, Donald Trump has proven he has no moral rudder. Instead of having respect for others, he insults and demeans. He preys on divisions and stokes hate, instead of healing and uniting.  Trump is everything we aspire not to be as Americans.
1223299854849445888 2020-01-31 09:39:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@JohnDelaney ran his campaign with conviction to make our government work for the American people. He will continue to be an important voice in shaping our country for years to come.  https://t.co/Dqg0D7s0p7
1223286098052485121 2020-01-31 08:45:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let's be clear: If Donald Trump can afford to give giant tax breaks to the super-wealthy, then he can afford to ensure that the most vulnerable in our society receive the health care they need and deserve.  We should be expanding Medicaid — not cutting it.
1223078215301967876 2020-01-30 18:59:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> Airline catering workers will feed thousands of people traveling to the Super Bowl, but can’t afford to feed their own families. I stand in solidarity with @unitehere_sofla. @AmericanAir needs to ensure @LSGSkyChefs pay their workers living wages.
1223073414568562688 2020-01-30 18:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The character of a president matters — and we have to make that clear this November.  https://t.co/hQobfKY7Fx
1223062089582940162 2020-01-30 17:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the most erratic and incompetent commander in chief we've ever had. After four years of his self-made chaos, we'll need a president who is ready to clean up the mess on day one.  https://t.co/TCOjc3aubF
1223049506775883777 2020-01-30 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> With just four days until Iowa and one day until our critical end-of-month fundraising deadline — your support has never been more important. Every donation — big or small — goes a long way in this final stretch.  Chip in today to help fuel our campaign:  https://t.co/WHzkM56Sas
1223025600459231232 2020-01-30 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can't let Donald Trump define us as a nation — we are so much better than who he thinks we are. Let’s choose to be the more perfect union we've always aspired to be and restore the soul of this nation.  https://t.co/zqQnWXRPcN
1222988102270013440 2020-01-30 13:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In four days, Iowans will gather in every corner of the state to set our nation on the path to picking the next president. It's a big responsibility — and we need your help to talk with as many folks as possible about what's at stake. Take action today:  https://t.co/0yBebrK3rY
1222950101724864515 2020-01-30 10:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s no understatement to say that Donald Trump represents an existential threat to the future of our country. He has repeatedly shown little understanding of — and zero regard for — our laws, our values, or our democracy.  We have to get him out of the White House.
1222926194502447104 2020-01-30 08:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ending gun violence is on the ballot. We have to take on the powerful gun lobby and pass common-sense measures that will keep our kids safe. I've beaten the @NRA twice — and I'll do it again as president.  https://t.co/lrgFPskUrf
1222724095051214848 2020-01-29 19:31:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> As I’ve said many times, health care is deeply personal to me, like it is for so many Americans. I’m proud to stand with @SEIU1199NW to fight for safe staffing, patient care, and fair pay.
1222698443463782400 2020-01-29 17:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The true character of a person is revealed in the Oval Office. We saw it with President Obama. We're seeing it with President Trump — and what we've witnessed from this president over the last three years makes clear that we can't give him another four.  https://t.co/SEb3XztnKI
1222691999364657152 2020-01-29 17:24:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump has slammed the door shut in the face of families fleeing persecution and violence. On day one, I will eliminate President Trump’s decision to limit asylum and end the MPP program. #RestoreAsylumNOW
1222685860497215488 2020-01-29 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I've spent my entire life bringing people together to get big, difficult things done. And I intend to do that as your president — unifying our country at the moment we need it most. There’s no limit to what we could do if we come together.  https://t.co/DTgRBe7X6H
1222666986317942789 2020-01-29 15:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Equal pay for equal work is common sense — and long overdue. That's why the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first law that the Obama-Biden Administration signed 11 years ago today. We have to continue the fight until we close the gender pay gap once and for all.
1222655410005397504 2020-01-29 14:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who respects religious freedom.  https://t.co/5PrjnXCig5
1222633013068161025 2020-01-29 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The decision to allow the Trump Administration to discriminate against immigrants based on wealth is a cruel betrayal of our values. The next four years could have a generational impact on our federal courts — we have to make Donald Trump a one-term president.
1222602815505301510 2020-01-29 11:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I need your help if we're going to restore the soul of this nation. With the Iowa Caucuses just days away, your donation is more important than ever.  Chip in $5 to help fuel our campaign:  https://t.co/HlWMIhCyki  https://t.co/RfI3EuTCcI
1222561289790246912 2020-01-29 08:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Climate is on the ballot. If we don’t get Donald Trump out of the White House and take action now to address the climate crisis, our planet may never recover.  https://t.co/Xu0IrxdYTQ
1222346121944715267 2020-01-28 18:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump’s demonstrated failures of judgment and his repeated rejection of science make him the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health challenge.  https://t.co/PH4vF5taDa
1222333539049332736 2020-01-28 17:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Imagine all the progress we could make in the next four years. We could make health care a right, lead on climate change, and get assault weapons out of our schools. It could all be a reality — but first, we have to beat Donald Trump.  https://t.co/O0FZ2Z1nlx
1222323147418017794 2020-01-28 16:58:42 -0800 <JoeBiden> A peace plan requires two sides to come together. This is a political stunt that could spark unilateral moves to annex territory and set back peace even more. I've spent a lifetime working to advance the security &amp; survival of a Jewish and democratic Israel. This is not the way.
1222307450495389696 2020-01-28 15:56:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> Iowans, on Feb. 3rd, you have a chance for a twofer. You can ruin Donald Trump's night, and you can ruin Senator Ernst’s, too.  https://t.co/NU8hk2TOAf
1222241683938725888 2020-01-28 11:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let's remember one thing when it comes to impeachment: Donald Trump is on trial because he's afraid to run against me. He knows I’ll beat him this November.
1222213749857234946 2020-01-28 09:44:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Health care is personal to me. Deeply personal. And I guarantee you that if I'm elected president, I will protect your family's health care as if it were my own family’s.  https://t.co/Uj15uqjsCi
1222007101389770759 2020-01-27 20:02:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> Iowa caucus-goers take note. Joni Ernst just spilled the beans. She and Donald Trump are scared to death I’ll be the nominee. On Feb. 3rd, let’s make their day.
1221987724095361024 2020-01-27 18:45:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> No family in search of a better life should be denied permanent residency because they don't meet Donald Trump's wealth test.  The United States of America should be open and welcome to all — not just the wealthy.
1221954793481990145 2020-01-27 16:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let's be clear: Donald Trump's Muslim ban was never about safety — it was a blatant ploy to fan the flames of bigotry and score points with his political base. I will end it.
1221938435511836673 2020-01-27 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> With just one week until the Iowa Caucus, we need your help to bring us across the finish line. Every door knocked, phone call made, or dollar chipped in goes a long way in this homestretch. Head to  https://t.co/ie4bECkx0e to get involved.  https://t.co/7F1dyHYd4V
1221906978332561408 2020-01-27 13:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On #HolocaustMemorialDay and the 75th anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation, we honor the millions of Jews and other victims whose lives were extinguished by the Nazi regime. Today and every day, we must give hate no safe harbor to ensure such atrocities never again occur.
1221890408009084936 2020-01-27 12:19:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> Selling off public services to private interests at the expense of workers and their communities should be a non-starter. Congratulations to the members of @ATUComm, who went on strike for 84 days to fight for their rights — and won.
1221880050951176192 2020-01-27 11:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Climate change poses an existential threat to our future — and we are running out of time to address it. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and rally the world to meet the urgency of this moment.  https://t.co/7kNfqn3EGi
1221852279097171968 2020-01-27 09:47:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm grateful to have the endorsement of the @scj. The battle for the soul of this nation begins in Iowa — and I'm confident that together, we'll make Donald Trump a one-term president and take back this country.
1221657342204350464 2020-01-26 20:53:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congrats @MichelleObama on winning a Grammy for telling your story with strength — and with grace. Jill and I are so thrilled for you. Just beat Barack to an EGOT, will ya?
1221556054141669382 2020-01-26 14:10:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I are sending our prayers to the Bryant family and to everyone who lost loved ones in today’s crash. It’s a reminder of how special — and fragile — life is. And it’s a reminder that we’ve got to make every day count.
1221513133321150464 2020-01-26 11:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Make no mistake: Our best days still lie ahead. If we come together and act as one America, there's nothing that we can't accomplish.
1221222865783132160 2020-01-25 16:06:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> The seas are rising. Australia is burning. And in this moment of crisis, our President thinks windmills cause cancer. Solving the climate crisis, starts with beating Donald Trump. And once I do, we'll pass my ambitious climate plan.  https://t.co/uClGwalbRW
1221213660191739904 2020-01-25 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Firefighters represent the best of America — they put their lives on the line every single day and selflessly rush toward danger to save others.  I'm grateful for the endorsement of @IAFFNewsDesk. There's no group of people I'd rather stand with.  https://t.co/KXWOONKaXl
1221195476843868160 2020-01-25 14:17:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every American deserves access to safe, clean drinking water. We have to hold polluters accountable and rid our water of unsafe levels of these chemicals for good.
1221176414625509377 2020-01-25 13:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Happy Lunar New Year to all those celebrating throughout the country. I'm grateful for the contributions that the AAPI community has made to enrich America's diversity. I hope the Year of the Rat brings good fortune, health, and happiness to all.
1221163328300408832 2020-01-25 12:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> One of my favorite parts of the campaign trail is meeting folks across the country and hearing their stories. So my team and I are picking one lucky person to sit down with me for a cup of joe.  Chip in today for your chance to win:  https://t.co/IYZ70gr2h9  https://t.co/YKzqbOMTvs
1221135646107955200 2020-01-25 10:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s be clear: Transgender equality is the civil rights issue of our time. There is no room for compromise when it comes to basic human rights.
1220857649748758529 2020-01-24 15:55:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> After four years of Betsy DeVos and the Trump Administration, our students and educators will need strong advocates in the White House who will repair the damage they have caused. That's exactly what they'll have with me and @DrBiden.
1220828240408870912 2020-01-24 13:58:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> 34 U.S. troops have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury after Iranian missiles struck their base in Iraq. Donald Trump brought us to the brink of war—then dismissed the injuries as “headaches.”  The idea that the commander in chief would take this lightly is disgusting.
1220813019917111297 2020-01-24 12:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The stakes of this election couldn’t be higher. Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he poses a threat to America and the world. We have to beat him.  https://t.co/yaf8S3gEF1
1220769483410702339 2020-01-24 10:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Immigrants have always made our country stronger. Our diversity is, and has always been, our greatest strength. Donald Trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does.  https://t.co/XQblLTH61O
1220731734469140480 2020-01-24 07:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The next president will face the enormous task of picking up the pieces left by President Trump. They will have to salvage our reputation, rebuild confidence in our leadership, and mobilize the world to meet new challenges. There will be no time to lose.  https://t.co/oizwBqMFNL
1220549484133961729 2020-01-23 19:30:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> My Dad used to say, "don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value." Your 2020 budget cuts Social Security and Medicaid while protecting giveaways to the wealthiest. You've shown us what you value.
1220529945174298627 2020-01-23 18:13:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> Great news out of Utah. No child should be subjected to the vile, immoral practice of conversion therapy. We have to ban it at the federal level and make sure every young person is affirmed and accepted just as they are.
1220513043504910337 2020-01-23 17:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I tell people that when a family experiences tragedy, the most important thing they can do is to turn their grief into purpose. @fred_guttenberg found his purpose — and his courage and determination have helped fuel the fight for gun safety reform.  https://t.co/CAEHM0zBeI
1220485109209423872 2020-01-23 15:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> U.S. troops hurt in Iran's missile attack are being evaluated for traumatic brain injuries. To Trump, it's just “headaches.” We need a president who respects our service members and honors our sacred duty to care for our wounded warriors.  https://t.co/lqzSDWezk7
1220456672017223680 2020-01-23 13:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s not hyperbole to say Donald Trump is a threat to our planet. We have to get him out of the White House and treat the climate emergency like the existential threat that it is. Our future depends on it.
1220437294609387520 2020-01-23 12:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On the anniversary of a hopeful moment, it's clear Trump's Venezuela policy is a dead end. Millions are suffering with the Maduro regime still in power.  https://t.co/dvUGFlTFNO
1220415903185006592 2020-01-23 10:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s going to take everyone rolling up their sleeves and doing their part to beat Donald Trump and take back this country. And with just 11 days until Iowa, your help has never been more important. Head to  https://t.co/0yBebrK3rY to take action from anywhere in the country.
1220182792304308225 2020-01-22 19:13:42 -0800 <JoeBiden> When we divert public funds to private schools, we undermine the entire public education system. We've got to prioritize investing in our public schools, so every kid in America gets a fair shot. That's why I oppose vouchers. #Espinoza
1220162986863542272 2020-01-22 17:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Empathy matters. I think it's important — not only for leaders — but for everybody to treat people with respect.  https://t.co/5HhEOowbBg
1220145370908352512 2020-01-22 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> An administration that gives trillions in tax cuts to giant corporations and the super-wealthy but cuts food assistance for the most vulnerable in our society is morally bankrupt.
1220104098969681920 2020-01-22 14:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 47 years ago today, #RoevWade recognized a woman's constitutional right to choose — but that right is under attack across the country. We must codify Roe into law and fight back against any state laws that violate it.
1220090128196100101 2020-01-22 13:05:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> My administration will not cut Social Security or Medicare benefits. Period. We’ll expand them. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is saying he would consider sacrificing seniors' benefits to protect tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and big companies. We have to defeat him in November.
1220063078643093506 2020-01-22 11:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our students and educators deserve better than four more years of Betsy DeVos.  https://t.co/ItIVwhBcDC
1220009534736994313 2020-01-22 07:45:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every morning I get up, I think to myself, "Is Beau proud of me?" He’s the one who made me promise to stay engaged — and that promise guides me every day.  https://t.co/EYHItOpeML
1219798086127509505 2020-01-21 17:45:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to end Citizens United, but we can't stop there. It's time we eliminate all private dollars from federal elections and return our democracy to the people.
1219788577443340288 2020-01-21 17:07:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> I've been fighting to protect — and expand — Social Security for my whole career. Any suggestion otherwise is just flat-out wrong.  https://t.co/KWIIJgFqGk
1219762850098319360 2020-01-21 15:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our government should work for everyone — not just the powerful or super-wealthy. We need to:  - Eliminate all private dollars from federal elections - End Citizens United and dark money groups - Increase transparency and accountability
1219742544877301760 2020-01-21 14:04:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> Make no mistake, Obamacare is on the ballot this November. Coverage for millions of Americans and protections for pre-existing conditions are on the ballot.  We have to protect the progress we've made and show up to the polls to defend the Affordable Care Act.
1219731392873013248 2020-01-21 13:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ten years ago, the Supreme Court unleashed an unlimited flood of dark money into our politics with its Citizens United decision—further corrupting our politics &amp; eroding faith in our democracy.  It’s time we end Citizens United. Add your name if you agree:  https://t.co/WJ5YRnXGPm
1219699683943014401 2020-01-21 11:14:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I was reminded this weekend by Pastor McCallum that we've got to bring a sense of community back to this country. That work starts now.  https://t.co/TB2R8sg3z7
1219476824264257537 2020-01-20 20:28:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> Social Security is the bedrock of American retirement. And in my administration, we won't just protect it. We'll expand it.  https://t.co/Uwilx0GlDQ
1219469818237259776 2020-01-20 20:00:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thanks for acknowledging this, Bernie. These kinds of attacks have no place in this primary. Let’s all keep our focus on making Donald Trump a one-term president.
1219449299760832514 2020-01-20 18:39:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> The courage shown today by the lawmakers, staff, and gun safety advocates in Richmond is inspiring. It's long past time the calls for reform are met with concrete action that ends our gun violence epidemic. #IStandWithVirginia today, and every day, until the job is done.
1219414303469522945 2020-01-20 16:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> From my days as a public defender to my time as Vice President — I've spent my entire career fighting against discrimination and championing civil rights. I'm running for president to bring that fight to the Oval Office and give everyone a full share of the American dream.  https://t.co/y015JDgrti
1219394286439084033 2020-01-20 15:00:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> In times of crisis and division, a president should seek to calm and heal. But time and again, President Trump has chosen to further stoke the flames.  He is poison to the soul of our nation.
1219363972672978946 2020-01-20 13:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” As we seek to restore the soul of this nation from a long moral lapse, we look to those words and take solace that this too shall pass and justice will prevail. #MLKDay
1219350885521858562 2020-01-20 12:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Honored to have won Jacquelyn's endorsement.  https://t.co/tGpNZjXacu
1219265521159458819 2020-01-20 06:28:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump's poisonous rhetoric and divisive politics have brought America to an inflection point. In this moment, we have an enormous opportunity to take the next great step forward as a nation.  Let's get to work. We can do this, together.  https://t.co/4jTqAI3aCj
1219070147543158784 2020-01-19 17:32:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is a big victory for South Carolina. The right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is — we have to break down barriers to the ballot box and ensure every American can make their voice heard.
1219004502566674432 2020-01-19 13:11:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> The big banks didn't need an additional $32 billion in savings, and their shareholders certainly didn't need an extra $21.5 billion in payouts.  It's time we ensure corporations pay their fair share and that our country rewards work — not wealth.
1218985478013235200 2020-01-19 11:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The 60th anniversary of our alliance with Japan reminds us that close partnership and deep cooperation are among our greatest assets. I understand the value of our alliances; they make us stronger. I would build on this legacy, rather than dismantling it.
1218945416596795393 2020-01-19 09:16:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> I stand with the snow plow drivers who work day in and day out to keep our roads safe, often in dangerous conditions. Every worker in this country deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages and benefits. Stay safe out there, @IBT_320.  https://t.co/hVLXy2urWP
1218930361402634242 2020-01-19 08:16:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you @Captsully for sharing your story. There’s a lot of kids who I bet needed to hear it.   Being different isn’t a barrier to success. It can give you the strength to save lives in a crash landing — or even run for President.
1218684496293384192 2020-01-18 16:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump continues to embrace corruption at home and abroad. Rather than addressing the root causes pushing people to flee Central America, he has undermined anti-corruption bodies—first in Guatemala and now in Honduras.  https://t.co/bJzaXo3XAQ
1218658070512861184 2020-01-18 14:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There used to be a basic bargain in this country—when you worked hard, you shared in the prosperity you helped create. But CEOs and Wall Street continue to put profits over workers. It's wrong.  We have to restore the dignity of work and ensure everyone earns what they deserve.
1218622334929518593 2020-01-18 11:53:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Together, we're going to beat Donald Trump and take back this country.  Chip in if you’re ready to leave him in the dust:  https://t.co/wyp2zOcUWA  https://t.co/qCgcncjpln
1218594149558972416 2020-01-18 10:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Weapons of war have no place in our communities. It’s time we take on the @NRA and ban assault weapons for good.
1218567473768747008 2020-01-18 08:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Vermont — you don't have to wait until March 3rd to cast your ballot, you can early vote now! Head to  https://t.co/bj5863RbJr to find all the info you need to make your voice heard in the primary.  https://t.co/L4oMQotl0g
1218327140053082114 2020-01-17 16:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Happy birthday, @MichelleObama. You’re a shining light in the lives of all that have the honor of knowing you. Jill and I are grateful to call you a dear friend.  But don’t tell Jill — I’m still eating ice cream. And I’m not sorry.  https://t.co/YSvEKrvlRk
1218305723706363913 2020-01-17 14:54:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who respects our troops — and who will restore honor and integrity to the Oval Office.  https://t.co/q9o1dUJ00h
1218305640042504192 2020-01-17 14:54:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump says he prefers war heroes who "weren't captured." He attacks Gold Star families. Now he calls our generals “losers," “babies” and “dopes."  He degrades the office he holds every day.  https://t.co/mvLLdHCzRz
1218294441255014403 2020-01-17 14:10:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> No malarkey here.  https://t.co/7ODeSCfYMu
1218285113164824577 2020-01-17 13:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Minnesota — early voting is now open! Don’t wait until March 3rd to cast your ballot, head to the polls and be one of the first in the nation to make your voice heard in the primary.  Find everything you need to know here:  https://t.co/WGNqS2VPDH  https://t.co/PfCV0FiHLq
1218245602623909890 2020-01-17 10:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It is a moral failing when children are ripped from their parents' arms, locked away in overcrowded detention centers, and denied toothbrushes and soap.  We have to end Donald Trump's cruel policies and build a fair and humane immigration system.
1218169872791764994 2020-01-17 05:55:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> This isn't just about who I am, this is about who we are as a country. We're tough, resilient, but always full of hope. With every fiber in my being, I believe there’s not a single thing we can't do—if we do it together.  https://t.co/GfPWX1VTvH
1217982368499236864 2020-01-16 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hate never goes away; it just hides. And when leaders give it oxygen — as Donald Trump has done — it comes roaring back.  https://t.co/NsCSRzlWlk
1217971138162298881 2020-01-16 16:45:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> America’s farmers have had enough of your empty promises, Mr. President.  https://t.co/9NSJj7pRjY
1217962049726226433 2020-01-16 16:09:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let's be clear: white supremacy, racism, and violence have no place in America. We have to root out these evils and give hate no safe harbor. If we stand together, we will win the battle for the soul of our nation.
1217937084876513282 2020-01-16 14:30:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> Voting is a right.
1217918195115257856 2020-01-16 13:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A president has to be able to not only fight — but heal and bring our country together. I promise you that’s what I will do if I’m elected.  https://t.co/MiRb0eGq9H
1217891772862468096 2020-01-16 11:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The character of our nation is on the ballot in this election. We are so much better than who Donald Trump thinks we are — and we have to prove that this November.  https://t.co/dToLAHQ2Hd
1217864525640278020 2020-01-16 09:41:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> If true, this constitutes an unprecedented attack on our Foreign Service. Amb. Yovanovitch spent her life advancing U.S. interests, only to be defamed by this administration. Our diplomats deserve better. It's inexcusable that Sec. Pompeo won't defend them.
1217637216937267206 2020-01-15 18:38:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> America has never lived up to our promise of equality for all, but we've never stopped trying. Virginia brought us closer to that highest ideal today by ratifying the long overdue #ERA.  Women's rights should be explicitly in our Constitution—not left to the whims of legislators.
1217613689068642305 2020-01-15 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm more optimistic about our future today than I was when I got elected to the Senate as a 29-year-old. If we come together and unite this country, there's not a single thing we can't do.  https://t.co/LGNHTgei6W
1217604963825848320 2020-01-15 16:30:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> My thoughts and prayers are with Mustafa Kassem's family at this difficult time. His death, after six years in an Egyptian jail, is an outrage. Americans unjustly detained anywhere in the world deserve our government’s full support and relentless efforts to secure their release.
1217583673282789377 2020-01-15 15:05:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> This seems like a great reason to rejoin the Paris Agreement, @realDonaldTrump.
1217570907176046592 2020-01-15 14:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m proud that today, our campaign is launching HBCU Students for Biden. This program will be dedicated to helping HBCU students throughout the country learn how to organize for our campaign.   Sign up here:  https://t.co/uDMyQf9hHx  https://t.co/blPhAsMK1m
1217546999433744386 2020-01-15 12:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm ready to debate Donald Trump on the economy. The American people are getting clobbered, and the wealthy are the only ones doing well. We have to rebuild the middle class, and this time, make sure everyone comes along.  https://t.co/C36Kym6X8J
1217516800369405952 2020-01-15 10:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Cornell is right — everything is at stake this November. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and unite this country. Because if we come together and act as one America, there is nothing that we can't accomplish.  https://t.co/RkNCr4M0ag
1217493376267886594 2020-01-15 09:06:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> Historically Black Colleges and Universities have always been the heartbeat of our country’s fight for justice. That’s why I’ll invest $70 billion in HBCUs and Minority-Serving Institutions.  When HBCUs rise, we all rise—join HBCU Students for Biden today:  https://t.co/oZQOh9KPTt  https://t.co/HqlwjwgeTU
1217321765174759424 2020-01-14 21:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I just got off the debate stage in Iowa, where we're in the homestretch before the caucus. With just 19 days left, every dollar counts.  Chip in if you're ready to take back this country and make Donald Trump a one-term president:  https://t.co/dZBws0E8HE  https://t.co/DJDvE02g5l
1217299473128443904 2020-01-14 20:16:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is the United States of America. There’s not a single thing beyond our capacity, if we do it together. Let’s go do it. #DemDebate
1217298932151263232 2020-01-14 20:14:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> With just 20 days until the Iowa Caucus, we need your help to fuel our campaign. Every donation—big or small—goes a long way in this homestretch.  If you liked what you heard at tonight's #DemDebate, please chip in what you can to keep our momentum going:  https://t.co/oHhLJeow4L
1217296167870115841 2020-01-14 20:03:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> Look, I’ve been the object of Donald Trump’s affection now more than anyone else on this stage. I’ve taken all the hits he’s delivered, and I’m only getting stronger in the polls. #DemDebate
1217289913969840130 2020-01-14 19:38:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> Republicans have savaged my only surviving son. They’ve spread lies about me that networks won’t even carry. It doesn’t matter if they go after me.  As President of the United States, I have to be able to not only fight — I have to heal. And that’s what I’ll do if I’m elected.
1217288891625025537 2020-01-14 19:34:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> Child care is personal to me: I was a single parent as a young senator. I commuted home to Delaware every night to tuck my kids into bed. Child care should be affordable for every parent. #DemDebate
1217286036092604417 2020-01-14 19:23:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Make no mistake, the situation with Iran is a crisis of Donald Trump’s own making. He claimed walking away from the Iran deal would deter Iranian aggression and result in a better deal. He failed on both accounts.  https://t.co/S2nsclIN1B
1217284316973207553 2020-01-14 19:16:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> Under the Biden administration, labor and environmental groups will be at the table to negotiate trade agreements. Period.  https://t.co/gKXwU2SpVu
1217281361247178752 2020-01-14 19:04:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> Medicare should be able to negotiate prices with drug companies. #DemDebate
1217280340114448384 2020-01-14 19:00:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve been very clear about what my health care plan would do: Build on Obamacare by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system easier to navigate. #DemDebate
1217275855401103360 2020-01-14 18:42:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we don’t write the global rules of the road for trade, cyber, climate change, and so much more, they may be written by China or other nations that don’t share our values. #DemDebate
1217273974427652097 2020-01-14 18:35:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> I wouldn’t meet with Kim Jong Un without pre-conditions. By meeting with him, Donald Trump gave Kim Jong Un what he was looking for: legitimacy. I will work closely with our allies and hold China accountable for its lack of pressure on the Kim regime’s bad behavior. #DemDebate
1217270827873460226 2020-01-14 18:22:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> No president can take our country to war without the informed consent of the American people. #DemDebate
1217270360443424768 2020-01-14 18:20:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> There’s a big difference between sending tens of thousands of American combat troops to the Middle East indefinitely – which I oppose and will end – and using small teams of special forces to support local forces doing the fighting to advance our common security. #DemDebate
1217269640893734912 2020-01-14 18:17:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> No one should shed a tear for Qassem Soleimani. But Trump’s reckless escalation and thoughtless withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal has made America less safe. We need a return to diplomacy and a steady hand at the wheel to navigate an increasingly dangerous world. #DemDebate
1217268959508078592 2020-01-14 18:15:10 -0800 <JoeBiden> When Trump discarded the Iran nuclear deal he promised it would produce a “better” one and curb Iranian aggression—the reverse happened. Iran has restarted its nuclear program and become more provocative. I’ll return to smart, disciplined diplomacy to address the threats we face.
1217267798025568256 2020-01-14 18:10:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> In 2009 President Obama asked me to oversee our effort to bring home our combat troops. I’ll put my record and my judgment up against anyone in terms of who is the right person to be Commander in Chief. #DemDebate
1217261367234711552 2020-01-14 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m about to step on stage for tonight’s #DemDebate in Iowa. Make sure to follow along here and on @TeamJoe for updates throughout the night, and tune in to @CNN at 9 PM ET to watch live!
1217250530164183040 2020-01-14 17:01:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> So much of what’s tearing this country apart can be fixed if we treat each other with basic dignity and respect once again. That starts with having a president who leads by example.
1217198381812080643 2020-01-14 13:34:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump has once again sided with corporations over American workers by making it easier for them to get away with wage theft and overtime violations.  It's time we put workers' rights over corporate greed and ensure everyone has the workplace protections they deserve.
1217145604691771392 2020-01-14 10:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re in a battle for the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. He has:  - Fanned the flames of hatred and bigotry - Embraced dictators - Ripped children from their parents' arms - Degraded our national character  We have to get him out of the White House.
1217091659076337664 2020-01-14 06:30:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> Why are you so obsessed with me, Mr. President?  https://t.co/BbAawEvQo6
1216920521369096192 2020-01-13 19:10:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm married to a teacher, I see firsthand how difficult it is. We've got to let educators do their job so our students can succeed - that means paying them the salaries they deserve and giving them the respect that they've earned.
1216906004308414465 2020-01-13 18:12:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> From day one, Donald Trump has been determined to roll back every environmental protection he could get his hands on.  At a time when the climate crisis is pushing our planet to the brink, we should strengthen protections — not weaken them.
1216888913199013889 2020-01-13 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The stakes of this election could not be higher. Eight years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of our nation. We can't let that happen.  We have to do everything in our power to make him a one-term president.
1216873556241416193 2020-01-13 16:03:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> When we said to give us your tired, poor, and huddled masses, we absolutely did not mean "unless they are fleeing violence."
1216842742145462275 2020-01-13 14:01:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> Transit workers are being attacked every day, often while buses are moving, putting bus drivers and riders in harm's way. That's why I strongly support the Transit Worker and Pedestrian Protection Act to protect our workers from harm while doing their job.
1216818448900263938 2020-01-13 12:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump has no strategy when it comes to Iran. No endgame. The only way out of his self-made crisis is through diplomacy — clear-eyed, hard-nosed diplomacy grounded in strategy, that's not about one-off decisions or one-upmanship.  https://t.co/yfb8OE98Xu
1216788361198866434 2020-01-13 10:25:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> Come on. Your administration has been arguing in court to repeal protections for people with pre-existing conditions.  You're trying to take health care away from millions of people. The least you could do is be honest about it.
1216758302421352451 2020-01-13 08:26:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Cory, you campaigned with joy and heart, and instead of just talking about bringing people together, you did it every day. You made our politics better just by running. Grateful to you and looking forward to your continued leadership.
1216546909579567104 2020-01-12 18:26:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Puerto Rico should not be treated any differently than if this happened anywhere else in America — it's wrong. We should be surging all the help that is needed to fix the damage done by the earthquakes.  https://t.co/AIAuQy2Fjs
1216495106037035011 2020-01-12 15:00:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> There’s enormous opportunity once we get rid of Donald Trump. We can:  - Address the climate emergency - Build a more inclusive middle class - Build on Obamacare - Ensure our government works for everyone — not just the powerful
1216464610318061577 2020-01-12 12:58:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump’s reckless policies have needlessly endangered our interests in the Middle East. But none of us should be under any illusions about the Iranian regime, and the Iranian people — like all people everywhere — have the right to peaceful protest. The world should support them.
1216424855257534464 2020-01-12 10:21:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Gracias por su apoyo, Mayor @EricGarcetti. Estoy orgulloso de caminar junto a los bomberos, los Angelenos, y los Americanos. Y hoy, me siento orgulloso de caminar junto a ti. Vamos.  https://t.co/X0WRq7QEnD
1216422087138693120 2020-01-12 10:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you for your endorsement, Mayor @EricGarcetti. I’m proud to walk with firefighters, Angelenos, and Americans. And today, I’m proud to walk with you. Let’s do this.  https://t.co/I01t0L2wXI
1216160510183428096 2020-01-11 16:50:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> I want to congratulate my friend Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller on making history. I've known Tom for years, he has never been afraid to take on the tough fights and has always served with honor and integrity—Iowa and our nation are better because of it.  https://t.co/plv5WDvUbc
1216109024040476672 2020-01-11 13:26:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I've seen firsthand how hard our educators work for little pay and with few resources. They deserve better. It's time we support our educators by giving them the pay and dignity they deserve.  https://t.co/d1o4WnUNrt
1216081341965590529 2020-01-11 11:36:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> What kind of nation are we if we simply accept that kids learn active shooter drills with their ABCs? We have to take on the @NRA and pass common-sense gun safety reforms to protect our children.  https://t.co/d76FxbwBuB
1216056642313359361 2020-01-11 09:57:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congratulations to President Tsai and the people of Taiwan for another successful election. You are stronger because of your free and open society. The United States should continue strengthening our ties with Taiwan and other like-minded democracies.
1216053407779360768 2020-01-11 09:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Members of Teamsters Local 104 are striking against ASARCO for their unfair labor practices—I called into the picket line to support them. Every company should provide its workers with the pay and benefits they've earned—especially one that pulls in over $1 billion in profits.  https://t.co/Pm1EYxodmU
1215808474501844992 2020-01-10 17:31:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> Firefighters represent the best of America — courageous, selfless, and always answering the call to duty. I'm grateful to those who are heading to help our friends in Australia battle devastating wildfires.
1215786650137055234 2020-01-10 16:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Being a nation of immigrants is and has always been one of our greatest strengths. Our diversity has always made us stronger, but Donald Trump doesn’t get that.  https://t.co/W8ORewXTYA
1215740345113141248 2020-01-10 13:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Make no mistake: the situation with Iran is a crisis of Donald Trump's own making. He brought us to the brink of war with no plan and no strategy.  He is the most erratic and incompetent commander in chief we've ever had.  https://t.co/LkmJvh1FAn
1215703603098288129 2020-01-10 10:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I've released 21 years of my tax returns. Why haven't you released any of yours, Mr. President?  Release your taxes or hush up about corruption.  https://t.co/g1C7l4imKW
1215653271961919489 2020-01-10 07:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump brought us dangerously close to starting a new war with Iran without any semblance of a plan.  This moment requires a leader who will be ready on day one to pick up the pieces and repair the damage Trump has caused.  https://t.co/HDNnbR8tEB
1215457388825923584 2020-01-09 18:16:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> I started the Cancer Moonshot so we could be the generation that finally cures cancer.  You then tried to slash nearly $1 billion for cancer funding.  We're lucky that the cancer rate is down, but we're luckier that Congress stopped you.
1215393056603561984 2020-01-09 14:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This election is about the soul of America — and a nation that allows our epidemic of school shootings to continue has a troubled soul. We have to beat the @NRA and get weapons of war off our streets. Lives depend on it.  https://t.co/WtSljHo3ka
1215358611024678913 2020-01-09 11:44:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Facebook continues to put their profits over the truth — allowing politicians like Donald Trump to spend an unthinkable amount of money on paid disinformation. Our democracy is worse off for their failure to confront this.
1215298432958529537 2020-01-09 07:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are so much better than who Donald Trump thinks we are. We don’t have to give in to his dark, petty, angry vision of America. We can choose to be the more perfect union we have always aspired to be — and restore the soul of this nation.  https://t.co/nkD23GxirG
1215082273822953472 2020-01-08 17:26:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> Instead of using his statement today to lay out a coherent strategy on Iran, Donald Trump used it to mislead the country on the Obama-Biden record. He's been President for three years. It's time he stops blaming President Obama for his failures.
1215082272682119170 2020-01-08 17:26:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm thankful no one was hurt in last night's attack. But we're only in this mess because Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran Deal (which even his advisors said was working), turned his back on our allies, and had no strategy for what comes next.
1215069324538499072 2020-01-08 16:34:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> Gabby is one of the strongest people I know. The resilience she has shown is remarkable. I'm inspired by her courage in turning tragedy into purpose and grateful for her relentless determination to make our country a safer place for all.
1215054324553764864 2020-01-08 15:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 3,820 days — that's how long it's been since the federal minimum wage was last raised. It’s unacceptable. Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour nationwide should be just our starting point for ensuring workers receive the pay they deserve.  https://t.co/pL3qZXsCJu
1215009026125303811 2020-01-08 12:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Pope Francis is absolutely right. As a nation, we have a moral obligation to ensure everyone has access to the care they need. Health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the few.  https://t.co/c84y4GAMCq
1214980085339623425 2020-01-08 10:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to rebuild the middle class. But this time, we have to make sure that people historically left out of the middle class — whether due to race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or religion — have the chance to be included in our success.  https://t.co/YTwf2WYOYd
1214722638733406209 2020-01-07 17:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m going to hold off on commenting on the news tonight until we know more, but there is one thing I will say: Jill and I are keeping our troops and Americans overseas in our prayers. We hope you’ll keep them in yours.
1214675579498192898 2020-01-07 14:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump says he wants to end endless wars in the Middle East, yet he is bringing us dangerously close to starting a new one.  https://t.co/lTXpzBrqQR
1214669387417952258 2020-01-07 14:05:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> Estoy con el pueblo de Puerto Rico, nuestros conciudadanos, en este momento de necesidad. Es inconcebible que gran parte del arduo trabajo de la recuperación ante desastres aún no se haya hecho. Tenemos que ofrecer apoyo concreto a Puerto Rico antes de que se pierdan más vidas.
1214646310256726016 2020-01-07 12:33:42 -0800 <JoeBiden> I stand with the people of Puerto Rico, our fellow citizens, in this moment of need. It’s unconscionable that so much of the hard work of disaster recovery continues to be left undone. We've got to deliver concrete support for Puerto Rico now before more lives are lost.
1214641417160724484 2020-01-07 12:14:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> Nicolás Maduro is a dictator. I strongly condemn his regime’s violent takeover of the Venezuelan National Assembly, the country’s sole remaining democratic institution.
1214627763832807424 2020-01-07 11:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the most reckless &amp; incompetent commander in chief we've ever had. Every day he directs American national security is a dangerous day for the world.  We have to get him out of the White House. Chip in to help make him a one-term president:  https://t.co/rvjLIX0Fxy
1214607032113913857 2020-01-07 09:57:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> At 1:00 PM, I'll be speaking about the escalating situation with Iran and the imperative need to restore respected, responsible, and dignified leadership on the world stage. Tune in to watch live:  https://t.co/wjXqg8F4Z9
1214340404289703936 2020-01-06 16:18:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump wants to ignore climate science when making infrastructure decisions. In the Biden Administration, every dollar spent toward rebuilding our roads, bridges, buildings, the electric grid, and our water infrastructure will be used to reduce and withstand a changing climate.
1214298343435915264 2020-01-06 13:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On Día de los Reyes, as Christmas comes to a close, we are reminded of the call of the three kings: to give of ourselves without expectation, seek peace no matter how long the journey, and know that a bright future is within reach. Jill and I wish a Happy Three Kings’ Day to all!
1214267892482469888 2020-01-06 11:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let's be clear: Donald Trump does not have the authority to take us into war with Iran without Congressional approval. A president should never take this nation to war without the informed consent of the American people.
1213987660802465793 2020-01-05 16:56:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> I stand in solidarity with those marching in New York against the rise of anti-Semitism. This is what the battle for the soul of our nation looks like — and it's up to all of us to reject intolerance in all its forms and give hate no safe harbor.
1213981505443287040 2020-01-05 16:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our Statue of Liberty invites in the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. But Donald Trump has slammed the door in the face of families fleeing persecution and violence. Jill traveled to Matamoros to shed light on how these policies hurt asylum seekers.  https://t.co/2Bwwl2pEzq
1213955345372065792 2020-01-05 14:48:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is a crisis of Donald Trump’s own making. He claimed pulling out of the Iran deal would deter Iranian aggression and result in a better deal. He has failed on both counts.  He is the most erratic and incompetent commander in chief we’ve ever had.
1213908021304332288 2020-01-05 11:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hey @realDonaldTrump, do you think the American people want another war in the Middle East? Des Moines certainly doesn’t.  https://t.co/uFgQuqg1oL
1213663155743842304 2020-01-04 19:26:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> The more the walls close in on this guy, the more irrational he becomes.  https://t.co/Nba7Color1
1213606448699232257 2020-01-04 15:41:39 -0800 <JoeBiden> The world is burning, yet Donald Trump continues to deny the evidence of climate change before all of our eyes. We have to get him out of the White House and take urgent global action to combat the climate crisis before it’s too late.
1213573089910493184 2020-01-04 13:29:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> This simply shouldn’t happen in America. Folks deserve access to affordable, quality long-term care in their homes.   We have to fight for Alex and those who use long-term care.
1213555699671851015 2020-01-04 12:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can overcome four years of Donald Trump, but if we give him eight years in the White House he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation. We can't let that happen.  https://t.co/LPhHZS08UE
1213515434420391937 2020-01-04 09:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On the trail, I hear countless stories from folks whose lives have been changed by Obamacare. We can't afford to start over—we need a president who will protect and build on it to ensure everyone has access to quality, affordable care.  https://t.co/99TUE7n9Gs
1213265034601611264 2020-01-03 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The prospect of direct conflict with Iran is greater than ever. Does Donald Trump have a strategy for what comes next?  Nothing we have seen from this Administration suggests that they are prepared to deal with the risks we now confront.  https://t.co/RF7DD3rcDb
1213217722508570624 2020-01-03 13:57:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a leader who will be ready on day one to pick up the pieces of Donald Trump's broken foreign policy and repair the damage he has caused around the world.  https://t.co/mB6i1U2yPv
1213131655474376705 2020-01-03 08:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our world has been set on edge by an erratic, unstable, and dangerously incompetent commander in chief. The stakes could not be higher. Every day that Donald Trump directs American national security is a dangerous day for the United States and the world.  https://t.co/EoWjabVp3u
1212954848666234880 2020-01-02 20:32:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> My statement on the killing of Qassem Soleimani.  https://t.co/4Q9tlLAYFB
1212922129886388224 2020-01-02 18:22:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump stacked the Supreme Court with justices to try to overturn Roe v. Wade—and now Republicans are seizing the opportunity to restrict a woman's constitutional right to choose. We have to fight these attacks and ensure this choice remains between a woman and her doctor.
1212908938590670848 2020-01-02 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're just one full day into 2020 and there have already been at least three mass shootings across the country.   Enough is enough. We have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to end this gun violence epidemic.
1212898749305020416 2020-01-02 16:49:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> Before the holidays, Jill walked across the Gateway International Bridge into Matamoros, Mexico, where families are enduring inhumane conditions. Jill witnessed the cruelty of Trump's policies and the resiliency of those risking their lives to seek asylum.
1212871441093255168 2020-01-02 15:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If you're a teacher or a firefighter, you're probably paying more in taxes than Amazon or Netflix. We've got to make sure corporations pay their fair share.
1212811057313583106 2020-01-02 11:01:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm excited to share that we raised $22.7 million this last quarter — our biggest quarter so far this campaign! Thank you to everyone who chipped in what you could — your support means the world to me. You truly are the heart of our campaign.  https://t.co/L53z9YbLsX
1212794433617436672 2020-01-02 09:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Like Vicky said, we need a president who will restore integrity to the White House.  https://t.co/i8k2OwsK7k
1212768009430937601 2020-01-02 08:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It was a privilege to work with @JulianCastro during the Obama Administration, and a true honor to be in this talented field of candidates with him. He led his historic campaign with grace and heart and used his platform to lift the voices of others. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
1212556035283705858 2020-01-01 18:07:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day that Donald Trump remains in the White House puts the future of our planet at risk. We have to beat him this November and take immediate action to address the climate emergency.
1212540258681851905 2020-01-01 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This election is about the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul.  https://t.co/cwzycLJV0d
1212524152608833536 2020-01-01 16:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> With just over one month until the Iowa Caucus, we need all hands on deck to talk with folks about what's at stake in this election.  Join our team today and let's get to work:  https://t.co/gnaFCAUzju
1212442112219844609 2020-01-01 10:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every single human being deserves to be treated with dignity. Everyone. The poor and the powerless, the marginalized and vulnerable, the “least of these.” That has been the animating principle of my life and my faith.  https://t.co/BwmOVQjxVk
1212180387260010496 2019-12-31 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our final fundraising deadline of 2019 is just hours away and we need your help. Every donation — big or small — goes a long way to helping us make Donald Trump a one-term president.  Chip in before midnight to help us reach our goal:  https://t.co/CznFJFHT2T
1212153964206198789 2019-12-31 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As we move into the New Year, there's one thing I know: in 2020 we're going to beat Donald Trump and take back this country.
1212131972295929856 2019-12-31 14:02:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> 2019 was a year of record violence — it will be a moral failure if we allow 2020 to be the same. We have to elect leaders with the courage to take on the @NRA and pass common-sense gun safety reform. We have to end this epidemic.
1212112439623458826 2019-12-31 12:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Next year could give us one of two things: a new administration or four more years of Donald Trump.  We can defeat him, but only with your help. Chip in what you can before our midnight deadline:  https://t.co/e9CcZTIZ9s
1212059591569297408 2019-12-31 09:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It will take years to repair the damage Betsy DeVos is doing to our schools. Our students and educators deserve a Secretary of Education who values our public schools — and is actually an educator.  https://t.co/ydZmEIGDcj
1211808506522849280 2019-12-30 16:37:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> We all said that Donald Trump’s trade war would lead to job losses and higher prices.  And now, it’s leading to job losses and higher prices.  I didn't read “Art of the Deal,” but this is the textbook definition of a failed negotiation.
1211791575270866945 2019-12-30 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tomorrow marks our end-of-year fundraising deadline and we need your help to reach our goal. Our campaign relies on supporters like you giving $5, $10, $20 at a time.  Chip in to help us end the year on a strong note:  https://t.co/66fN2OSJLE  https://t.co/bfTcNfh9Bx
1211772701095944195 2019-12-30 14:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Health care should be more than just a luxury reserved for those who can afford it. It’s a right we all deserve – one that is central to our dignity, and to who we want to be as a country.  https://t.co/CMJWaJu9Yv
1211734952263352320 2019-12-30 11:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My dad had a saying: “Joey, the greatest sin of all is the abuse of power.”  Right now, our democracy is at risk. We’ve got to come together and fight back against Donald Trump — Democrats, Republicans, Independents alike.  https://t.co/uZBwyJFD9V
1211698965441372160 2019-12-30 09:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Scripture is clear: It’s not enough to just wish the world were better. It’s our duty to make it so—including by leading the world in addressing the climate crisis and providing a roadmap to citizenship for those contributing to our communities.  https://t.co/BwmOVQjxVk
1211466200909336576 2019-12-29 17:57:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congressman Lewis has always fought in the name of building a more just, more fair country. If there's anybody who can take the fight to cancer, it's you, John. Jill and I are sending our prayers to you and your family. Keep the faith, and keep up the fight.
1211403770027839489 2019-12-29 13:49:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No one in America should work full time and live below the poverty line. It’s past time we raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and provide a reliable pathway to the middle class.  https://t.co/oAAnBGTCeo
1211332550775304193 2019-12-29 09:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump will stop at nothing to sabotage Obamacare and roll back the progress we've made. We have to protect the ACA and build on it to ensure every American has access to quality, affordable care.  https://t.co/kpR8YxOFMY
1211305062280118274 2019-12-29 07:16:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> The horrifying rise of antisemitism is tearing apart the fabric of our communities and the soul of this nation. We've got to stand together as a country and fight these flames of hatred.  My deepest sympathies are with the victims, their families, and the Jewish community.
1210961103955447808 2019-12-28 08:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our democracy is in trouble. We’re at the breaking point. And we need a president who will rise above the personal attacks and reach out to unite this nation.  If we come together and act as one America, there's nothing we can’t accomplish.
1210946792369610752 2019-12-28 07:33:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> The subpoenas should go to witnesses with testimony to offer to Trump’s shaking down the Ukraine government — they should go to the White House.
1210946790104666113 2019-12-28 07:33:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> But I am just not going to pretend that there is any legal basis for Republican subpoenas for my testimony in the impeachment trial. That is the point I was making yesterday and I reiterate: this impeachment is about Trump’s conduct, not mine.
1210946785847468033 2019-12-28 07:33:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> I want to clarify something I said yesterday. In my 40 years in public life, I have always complied with a lawful order and in my eight years as VP, my office — unlike Donald Trump and Mike Pence — cooperated with legitimate congressional oversight requests.
1210698120566194176 2019-12-27 15:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our end-of-year fundraising deadline is quickly approaching — and we need your help to reach our goal in order to make the investments in Iowa necessary to win.  With just 38 days until the caucus, we need every dollar we can get. Chip in today:  https://t.co/Kdq4kVimfs
1210685537499123712 2019-12-27 14:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is a threat to the future of our planet. Over the last year, he has rolled back regulations on:  - Methane leaks - Auto pollution - Clean water protections  - Endangered species protections  We have to get him out of the White House.  https://t.co/Dv1wjpEIRp
1210667921615265798 2019-12-27 13:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is a big victory in the fight for voting rights. We should be making voting easier — not harder — and ensure every American can make their voice heard at the ballot box.  https://t.co/CShn7DPLBH
1210631934445010944 2019-12-27 10:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Next year the American people will decide who we are as a nation and, perhaps even more importantly, who we want to be. We are so much better than who President Donald Trump thinks we are.  https://t.co/xcT9ARiajP
1210320381502009351 2019-12-26 14:04:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I would like to send our best wishes to everyone celebrating Kwanzaa. Today is the start to a seven-day reflection on the rich heritage of African-American culture, remembering the seven principles.
1210261112672997378 2019-12-26 10:08:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is cutting food assistance for 700,000 people, but somehow found $1.4 billion for his sham of a border wall. This administration is morally bankrupt.
1209911690235531264 2019-12-25 11:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When we say Merry Christmas from the entire Biden family, that means even the dogs.  https://t.co/PblQHBH792
1209873051946491906 2019-12-25 08:26:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> May your time with loved ones be full of peace, laughter, and joy. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. With love, from my family to yours.  https://t.co/L7mwR4nBKd
1209594095573884928 2019-12-24 13:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hope you all are having as much fun this holiday as I did answering these questions:  https://t.co/hOYtYs8mCz
1209283729610424321 2019-12-23 17:24:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> There is no denying the existential threat of climate change — and time is running out to address it. If we give Donald Trump another four years in the White House, our planet may never recover.
1209263668736745473 2019-12-23 16:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s simple: companies should have to compete for workers just like they compete for customers. We should get rid of non-compete clauses and no-poaching agreements that do nothing but suppress wages.  https://t.co/lEipvZdShu
1209248569565368321 2019-12-23 15:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our firefighters work tirelessly to make our communities safer, better places to live. We need a president who supports them and rewards work, not wealth.  https://t.co/ncy4GgZ8SO
1209218293841743872 2019-12-23 13:04:42 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t let the scourge of gun violence tear our communities apart any longer. We need to take on the @NRA and pass common-sense reforms to end our gun violence epidemic.
1209181879460450304 2019-12-23 10:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump should release his taxes or shut up about corruption.  https://t.co/5G8VwWsyx0
1209149164090744833 2019-12-23 08:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> After the most corrupt administration in modern American history, the next president faces a big task: restoring faith in American government. We must root out corruption and ensure our government works for the people — not the powerful.  https://t.co/oZnl5qhhuY
1208941777513844738 2019-12-22 18:45:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. We can’t sit by while hate crimes surge — fueled by a president who fans the flames of white nationalism. It’s up to all of us to reject intolerance in all its forms and give hate no safe harbor.
1208937771336753153 2019-12-22 18:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@DrBiden and I send our warm wishes to everyone celebrating Hanukkah in the United States and around the world. Chag Sameach!
1208902263508553729 2019-12-22 16:08:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> America's farmers are being undermined by Trump's broken promises. No one knows that better than Iowa. We need a president who will keep his word.
1208878734691975168 2019-12-22 14:35:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> If Donald Trump ever makes you feel like this, chip in $5 to help us get him out of the White House:   https://t.co/6K1v9cXRWn  https://t.co/2r8kUyYHbT
1208828299629277190 2019-12-22 11:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve dedicated my life to public service. We need a president who honors that duty.  https://t.co/nNLb7MjZYt
1208566206044803077 2019-12-21 17:53:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> Michael Cohen Michael Flynn Rick Gates Paul Manafort George Papadopoulos Roger Stone  Donald Trump has surrounded himself with people who flout our laws — we shouldn’t be surprised that he thinks he is above the law. We deserve better as a country.
1208549507773947904 2019-12-21 16:47:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> If anyone has reason to be angry with Republicans, it’s me. I have no love for them after the way they’ve attacked me and my family. But we have to unite this country and get things done.  https://t.co/GYFzcjMcAm
1208477824258072576 2019-12-21 12:02:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> TJ: Stay strong  Me, Jill, and the whole Biden family are with you. Not just in spirit — for anything.  You have the right attitude. You are going to beat this and when you do, we are going to be there to celebrate.    Love you, and we're here with you.
1208463620377661442 2019-12-21 11:05:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we have to ensure everyone comes along.  https://t.co/H8XjoicQnR
1208422096474390528 2019-12-21 08:20:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> I don’t care whether you’re an undocumented immigrant, an asylum seeker, or born in the US. Forcing people to choose between being reunited with their kids and risking arrest sets a new standard for cruelty.   This idea is Stephen Miller’s. The responsibility is Trump's.
1208152309550714882 2019-12-20 14:28:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> When Champ and Major go to the vet, I want them to get the best care, and for their caretakers to be paid a fair wage. @marspetcareUS are standing in the way of unionization efforts at @VCAPetHealth and @bluepearlvet. Vet techs deserve a voice in the workplace.
1208101266280386560 2019-12-20 11:06:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> It has now been nearly 300 days. It’s time for @senatemajldr McConnell to do his job and bring this bill up for a vote. Lives depend on it.  https://t.co/rFzGmuMUMf
1208081407215652870 2019-12-20 09:47:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m more optimistic about our future today than I was when I got elected to the Senate as a 29-year-old. If we come together and act as one America, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish.
1207889817461243904 2019-12-19 21:05:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> We had a great night at tonight’s #DemDebate, and I really appreciate your support. Let’s keep this momentum going — if you can, chip in $5 to help fuel our campaign now:  https://t.co/17qqwjr0eW  https://t.co/hEaa5daSSP
1207888690997014528 2019-12-19 21:01:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> China commits enormous human rights abuses, and denies its citizens access to basic information — all while Trump looks the other way. If I am president, human rights won't be blacked out of the conversation.
1207887014353350658 2019-12-19 20:54:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> We've got to level with the American people. Don't play games with them. Tell them the truth and be authentic.  https://t.co/PdJCTVnuU2
1207885405850361856 2019-12-19 20:48:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> If you believe we need to bring empathy back to the White House chip in $5:  https://t.co/5kbka2BrL9  https://t.co/s3mGJHxXBB
1207870357631381505 2019-12-19 19:48:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> I just stepped off tonight's #DemDebate stage, where I discussed my bold vision for our future and how I'll deliver real change for American families. It was a great night, but now I need your help – chip in $5 to keep our momentum going:  https://t.co/SfGQSd4CM9
1207867825349640193 2019-12-19 19:38:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> The ability to make change will come down to three things:   - Who can beat Trump? - Who can help flip the Senate? - Who can turn big ideas into change?   I am the best candidate on stage to do all three. #DemDebate
1207865574795161600 2019-12-19 19:29:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> The climate emergency presents an enormous opportunity for our nation to take action. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and tackle this crisis. #DemDebate  https://t.co/1NpOrW2Eo1
1207862146534649856 2019-12-19 19:15:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s be clear — Medicare for All not only ends private health coverage, it eliminates millions of jobs, and increases taxes on the middle class. #DemDebate  https://t.co/PCN0yggK4Y
1207859230675537920 2019-12-19 19:04:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> I have long been a skeptic on Afghanistan. We must learn the lessons of the past 18 years. It is long past time to end America’s longest war and focus on what is achievable: a narrow counterterrorism mission. #DemDebate
1207846568767954944 2019-12-19 18:13:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> I refuse to accept the notion that we can never get to a place where we have cooperation again. If that’s the case, we’re dead as a country. When we can’t convince them, we have to go out and beat them. #DemDebate  https://t.co/mQqU7aRc4f
1207843729454829573 2019-12-19 18:02:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> The United States and our partners make up more than half of global GDP. If we stand together, China won’t be able to withstand the pressure. We should be mobilizing our allies to meet this challenge, not driving them away. #DemDebate
1207842283455991809 2019-12-19 17:56:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> America's commitment to Israel’s security must be unwavering. The Obama-Biden administration provided unprecedented levels of assistance, including for Iron Dome. But true peace and security for Israelis &amp; Palestinians requires a two-state solution. Trump has set us back.
1207840984928849920 2019-12-19 17:51:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> If anyone has reason to be angry with the Republicans and not want to cooperate it's me, the way they've attacked me, my son, my family. I have no love. But the fact is we have to be able to get things done and when we can't convince them, we go out and beat them. #DemDebate
1207839405504974853 2019-12-19 17:45:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need to restore integrity to the office of the Presidency. And it's time we got that underway. #DemDebate  https://t.co/ZZMLhU3CQi
1207838763826716675 2019-12-19 17:42:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> The middle class is getting killed. 40% of farmers in the midwest couldn’t pay their bills last year. We have to make sure the middle class has a shot, and that’s why we must change this Presidency now. #DemDebate  https://t.co/790cFmj5Oa
1207837874726559747 2019-12-19 17:39:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> The science is clear: we need action now, and we can't do it alone. As president, I will take unprecedented action at home and abroad to tackle the climate crisis head on. #DemDebate  https://t.co/SyVhWMnAaE
1207833664530370560 2019-12-19 17:22:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> My north star as president will be rebuilding the backbone of this country: the middle class. And, I’m going to make sure that this time everyone comes along. #DemDebate
1207829446075539457 2019-12-19 17:05:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> The House carried out its constitutional duty in impeaching Donald Trump. Regardless of the outcome in the Senate, we must stay focused on doing everything we can to ensure he doesn’t get elected to a second term. Join us:  https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW
1207825781965164550 2019-12-19 16:51:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m about to step on stage for tonight’s #DemDebate in LA. Follow along here and on @TeamJoe for updates throughout the night, and tune in to @PBS and @CNN at 8 PM ET to watch live!
1207824644163670016 2019-12-19 16:46:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our children's future and the success of America stands on the shoulders of public school educators. Educators deserve to have fair wages and the resources they need to be able to do their jobs.
1207808580474327041 2019-12-19 15:43:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The defining characteristic of the Trump Administration is the abuse of power.
1207785176169877510 2019-12-19 14:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe Burrow worked hard to reach the pinnacle of college football, but he never forgot the everyday struggle of the community he came from. Joe - your humility is inspiring. Thank you for reminding us to never forget those less fortunate than us.   https://t.co/EYbtU86c0D
1207718244582342656 2019-12-19 09:44:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> John Dingell was an American patriot and a selfless public servant — and Debbie Dingell has carried his legacy in the House with grace and dignity. This is equally as cruel as it is pathetic, and it is beyond unconscionable that our President would behave this way.
1207690082553139201 2019-12-19 07:52:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump failed to repeal the ACA in Congress. Now he has turned to the courts to sabotage it — and is threatening protections for more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions in the process. We need to protect Obamacare — and build on it.
1207479041256755201 2019-12-18 17:53:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump abused his power, violated his oath of office, and betrayed our nation. This is a solemn moment for our country. But in the United States of America, no one is above the law — not even the President.
1207464563781832706 2019-12-18 16:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> With just 47 days until the Iowa Caucus, we need your help to talk with voters across the country about what's at stake in this election. You can make a difference from wherever you live by going to  https://t.co/0yBebrssAq to get involved.
1207458021539926017 2019-12-18 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Deberíamos dedicar las mentes más brillantes de Estados Unidos a resolver la epidemia de violencia armada. Estos fondos para la investigación sobre las causas y la prevención de la violencia armada debieron haberse otorgado hace mucho tiempo.  https://t.co/Of7ISxdfbf
1207439146031206411 2019-12-18 15:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we’re going to ensure that everyone comes along.  https://t.co/Ldks3fIeYT
1207425053312180224 2019-12-18 14:19:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hate didn’t begin with Donald Trump, and it won’t end with him. But this is a defining moment in our nation’s history. A moment where we are once again called to fight against the same forces of hate and intolerance that we've battled throughout history.  https://t.co/7uUXqyD1Zs
1207408947054776320 2019-12-18 13:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We should be dedicating America’s brightest minds to solving the gun violence epidemic. This funding for research on the causes and prevention of gun violence is long overdue.  https://t.co/Of7ISxdfbf
1207371953348079616 2019-12-18 10:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Glad to hear @UNITEHERE11 and Sodexo reached a tentative agreement that provides workers with the wages and benefits they deserve. I look forward to joining the debate tomorrow to discuss how I'll strengthen our unions and build an inclusive middle class.  https://t.co/NbAbdMI5nw
1207355897191776257 2019-12-18 09:44:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> @brianschatz @CarolynBMaloney It is long past time that every American has 12 weeks of paid leave to address their own health needs or care for any of their loved ones.
1207355595579256832 2019-12-18 09:43:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's about time that federal workers get paid parental leave. Congratulations to @BrianSchatz and @CarolynBMaloney for pushing this bill over the finish line in Congress.  https://t.co/UlhL1s87HC
1207334708398448640 2019-12-18 08:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president our children can look up to.  https://t.co/WbQUecrEI9
1207105195655585792 2019-12-17 17:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he proves how morally unfit he is to lead our country. We must make him a one-term president.
1207080533018193927 2019-12-17 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@JohnKerry is a patriot who has dedicated his life to serving our country. I'm lucky to call him a friend and honored to have his endorsement.  https://t.co/gU0ACEDu0L
1207061658922672128 2019-12-17 14:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s call this what it is: a right-wing effort to influence our elections and make it harder for folks to vote. We have to fight these partisan attacks on our democracy and ensure everyone can make their voice heard at the ballot box.  https://t.co/Wncpg6VcP2

1206765960285184000 2019-12-16 18:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Amazon, Netflix, General Motors, Chevron, Starbucks, and 86 other corporations paid less in federal income taxes than you did last year. It's wrong — and it needs to end.  It's time corporations pay their fair share.  https://t.co/kdixyRIilp
1206742052978872321 2019-12-16 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must take on the @NRA and get these weapons of war off our streets.  https://t.co/qRtP71LPtI

1206288313323180032 2019-12-15 11:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Trump Administration is recklessly loosening regulations on greenhouse gas emitters. As president, I’ll ensure these corporations are held accountable.  https://t.co/sw0QAa4Nlr

1205571256575287296 2019-12-13 11:32:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> I won't be crossing a picket line. We’ve got to stand together with @UniteHere11 for affordable health care and fair wages. A job is about more than just a paycheck. It's about dignity.
1205569268647112704 2019-12-13 11:24:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> The right to vote is the most sacred American right there is — and we can protect it by restoring the Voting Rights Act, stopping foreign interference in our elections, fighting back against gerrymandering and calling for automatic voter registration. #LetUsVoteFL
1205539587520638977 2019-12-13 09:26:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tom Joyner is like no other. @TJMShow and his presence in the community were legendary, and his work on HBCUs will make a difference for generations.

1205518218368040961 2019-12-13 08:01:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> I applaud the Senate's landmark legislation formally recognizing the Armenian Genocide. If we don't fully acknowledge the past, “never again” loses its meaning. The facts must be as clear and as powerful for future generations as for those whose memories are seared by tragedy.
1205272369024995328 2019-12-12 15:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump continues to deny the scientific evidence in front of his own eyes — and we’re all paying the price. We must get him out of the White House and treat climate change like the existential threat it is.  https://t.co/X1jaCtz1c3
1205248712861085698 2019-12-12 14:11:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must restore our nation's commitment to humane and effective immigration policies. As president, I'll provide a fair and just system that helps to grow and enhance our economy, and secure our  cherished values.  https://t.co/29QNatX4Wg

1205163547023556609 2019-12-12 08:32:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump’s reckless decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement has put our ability to confront the climate crisis in jeopardy. It proves he doesn’t have any idea of what we’re up against, despite indisputable evidence. And it again confirms that he's incapable of real leadership.
1205162897577373696 2019-12-12 08:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ll rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one—and rally the world to push our progress further and faster. It’s time to put an end to Trump’s shameful abdication of leadership. The future of our country and the world our children and grandchildren inherit hangs in the balance.

1204938921659916289 2019-12-11 17:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must take urgent action to end Donald Trump’s draconian immigration policies. In my first 100 days, we will:  - End his inhumane asylum policies - End wasteful efforts to build a wall - Reverse “Muslim bans” - Reverse his “public charge” rule - Protect Dreamers &amp; TPS holders
1204925080381382658 2019-12-11 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump has bullied our neighbors in Central America and abandoned U.S. leadership in the region.

1204916272330399744 2019-12-11 16:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You shouldn’t be forced to give up the health insurance and benefits that you fought for. Period.  https://t.co/sqNVioTmDM

1204887331716714496 2019-12-11 14:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Being a nation of immigrants has always been one of our greatest strengths. Our diversity makes us stronger. Donald Trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does.  https://t.co/cQSjBrRF1o
1204835741554987008 2019-12-11 10:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Immigration has always made us stronger—it’s essential to who we are.

1204585513912602626 2019-12-10 18:15:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can't afford four more years of a president who denies the scientific evidence in front of his eyes. We must get Trump out of the White House and treat climate change like the existential threat it is.
1204570242204090369 2019-12-10 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump is leading the most corrupt administration in modern American history. At every turn, he has used the power of the presidency to benefit his own personal interests. It has got to end.  I'll ensure our government works for all Americans — not just the powerful.

Trump continues to side with the brutal Kim Jong Un regime at the expense of American leadership, our allies, and our security.

Trump’s failed policies are destroying American jobs.
1204176397058609152 2019-12-09 15:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 36,878 — that’s how many Americans have died from gun violence so far this year. We cannot go on like this any longer. We must take action to end our gun violence epidemic.
1204152489689460736 2019-12-09 13:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is erratic, unstable, and dangerously incompetent. Every day that he directs our national security is a dangerous day for the United States.  https://t.co/aGUxe4ItmQ

1203101564723810304 2019-12-06 15:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Couldn't have said it better myself! I’m honored to have @JohnKerry join me for the #NoMalarkey barnstorm.  https://t.co/qMLSGkG91x
1203095560988823552 2019-12-06 15:35:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> We deserve to know what Donald Trump is hiding.
1203088557927288832 2019-12-06 15:07:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, House Democrats led the way by passing a bill to restore the Voting Rights Act. All but one Republican voted against it. Shameful. Strengthening our democracy should not be a partisan issue. #HR4 #RestoreTheVote
1203088557075828736 2019-12-06 15:07:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Voting Rights Act used to be one of our best tools to fight state laws designed to suppress the vote — particularly the votes of people of color. Then it was gutted by the Supreme Court, and Congressional Republicans have refused a legislative fix.
1203075643996549120 2019-12-06 14:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m so proud and so humbled to have @JohnKerry's support. He is an American hero, statesman, visionary, and friend. His endorsement and partnership mean the world to me.  https://t.co/RShmQw3F2n
1203041670285033472 2019-12-06 12:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm proud to stand with @SEIU1984 and NH’s state employees as they fight for fair wages — Governor Sununu cannot shortchange workers with a contract that doesn't fairly compensate them. #UnionsForAll #NHPolitics
1203025060539355137 2019-12-06 10:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@DrBiden and I send our prayers to those affected by today's tragic shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola. We're grateful for the brave first responders who rushed to the scene and selflessly risked their lives to save others.
1202972212384288768 2019-12-06 07:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about dignity. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything is going to be okay—and mean it. Too many people today can’t do that.  We have to rebuild an inclusive middle class and restore the dignity of work.
1202776170162507778 2019-12-05 18:26:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This administration is morally bankrupt.
1202761574332739584 2019-12-05 17:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who is respected on the world stage.  https://t.co/Hqv6T06Mtv
1202729362283470848 2019-12-05 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congratulations @AFLCIO on 64 years of empowering workers to bargain for what they deserve. The 40-hour workweek, paid leave, health care protections, a voice in your workplace safety — it’s all because of unions. It’s time we recognize that.
1202718037868048385 2019-12-05 14:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Nuestro presidente debería ser capaz de cumplir con una prueba simple: entender que los puertorriqueños son ciudadanos americanos y que tienen derecho a, y merecen, el mismo apoyo del gobierno de los Estados Unidos que todos los demás ciudadanos.  https://t.co/SdGNYLnS07
1202716779962937346 2019-12-05 14:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our president should be able to meet a simple test: understanding that Puerto Ricans are American citizens, and that they are entitled to—and deserve—the same support from the United States government as every citizen.  Donald Trump has failed that test.   https://t.co/SG3yG0evPv
1202707216249344001 2019-12-05 13:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> DREAMers are Americans — and it’s time we make it official. We must keep our promise to them and provide a pathway to citizenship.  https://t.co/3yFphHXXpi
1202683919310741504 2019-12-05 12:19:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump continues to embarrass us on the world stage. We need a president who is ready on day one to repair our global reputation and restore American leadership abroad.  But I can't get to the White House without your help, chip in today:  https://t.co/gA52lvCDoa
1202664182950195200 2019-12-05 11:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I’ll make sure giant corporations and the super-wealthy pay their fair share in taxes — and then invest that money in growing a stronger, more inclusive middle class.  https://t.co/DN8qxaLCXD
1202613599610515456 2019-12-05 07:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump is destroying American leadership and credibility abroad. As president, I'll rebuild a modern, agile U.S. Department of State—investing in and re-empowering the finest diplomatic corps in the world.  https://t.co/90w0xT1012
1202418564185108481 2019-12-04 18:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My administration will spark the second great railroad revolution to propel our nation's infrastructure into the future and help solve the climate emergency.  https://t.co/0LEAtfweyv
1202401954644865024 2019-12-04 17:39:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The world is laughing at President Trump. They see him for what he really is: dangerously incompetent and incapable of world leadership.  We cannot give him four more years as commander in chief.  https://t.co/IR8K2k54YQ
1202321676337324032 2019-12-04 12:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Take a look inside the #NoMalarkey bus with my favorite road trip partner, @DrBiden.  https://t.co/P6l93iqigR
1202302550227275787 2019-12-04 11:04:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in a battle for the soul of America. It’s time we come together, remember who we are, and take this country back.  https://t.co/HJEtURsyZr
1202275119927717888 2019-12-04 09:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Nearly 1 in 3 women worldwide are subjected to physical violence, rape or stalking by a partner at some point in their lives. As president, I’ll tackle this epidemic head-on, and work to end violence against women. #16Days  https://t.co/UlBIhBkGU2
1202054917994766336 2019-12-03 18:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Trump Administration's "Infrastructure Weeks" have been a bunch of malarkey. As president, I'll make a transformational investment in our nation's infrastructure and future.   https://t.co/hQHA5bIeZa  https://t.co/pPd81hckon
1202037302265925634 2019-12-03 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I applaud Monday's sentences against seven of the men found guilty of killing Honduran environmental leader Berta Caceres. Environmentalists and human rights activists should not have to fear for their lives. #JusticeForBerta  https://t.co/6cXU5A80f8
1202028242187771904 2019-12-03 16:54:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every worker deserves fair wages, good benefits, and protections from sexual harassment. I’m proud to stand in solidarity with @hgsuuaw. I urge the university to negotiate in good faith to secure a fair contract with good health care benefits.
1202007103553933317 2019-12-03 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m running for president to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild a more inclusive middle class, and unite all Americans.  If you’re with me, let me know by chipping in to our campaign today:  https://t.co/NrwbCBIhx1
1201992004764200962 2019-12-03 14:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Kamala Harris is an incredible talent with unlimited potential. Her career has been defined by taking on those who abuse power and seeking equity and justice for all people. Her intellect and insight will continue to be needed by the Democratic Party and the country.
1201973129515556864 2019-12-03 13:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Everyone deserves the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care. My administration will give people the choice between their existing plan and a Medicare-like public option. It’s the most effective way to achieve universal coverage.
1201684287411675137 2019-12-02 18:07:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> @DrBiden @MeghanMcCain Confirmed: true.
1201681960533286912 2019-12-02 17:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the United States of America, we leave nobody behind — no matter your race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability. We need a president who understands that.  https://t.co/2a4Y74lX37
1201659815476563971 2019-12-02 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we don’t take urgent action to address the climate emergency, our planet may never recover. We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.  https://t.co/8zcoWXwKIY
1201644715583688704 2019-12-02 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My team and I are going to pick someone to fly out to come meet me on the trail and share a meal, all expenses on us. And yes, we can have ice cream for dessert!  Time is running out to enter — chip in for your chance to win:  https://t.co/YQMJE4zBYH  https://t.co/oQkCKI0fPf
1201629616072544256 2019-12-02 14:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must get these weapons of war out of our communities. #NoMalarkey  https://t.co/zuEKa4ENFV
1201614517270126592 2019-12-02 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve always believed we are strongest when we act as one America. If we come together and unite this country, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish.  If you agree, join our team today:  https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW
1201608225017217030 2019-12-02 13:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@GovernorBullock and I have always agreed on a central tenet of his campaign: every American deserves a fair shot. He has served Montana well and will continue to do so with fairness and strength. Thank you, Governor.
1201579284239962113 2019-12-02 11:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Meet Richard. Find out why he, like millions of Americans, supports protecting and expanding Obamacare.  https://t.co/Yp6G1ci0ag
1201574251045826566 2019-12-02 10:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> American leadership has served as the backbone of NATO since its founding 70 years ago — until President Trump. His abdication of America’s traditional leadership role could not come at a more critical moment for the alliance.  https://t.co/xDIRFzjyBe
1201327877569970176 2019-12-01 18:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 64 years ago today, Rosa Parks' courageous act forever changed our country and the course of history. We must continue to follow her brave example and speak out against injustice, wherever it is found.
1201303718391615493 2019-12-01 16:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re officially on the road for our eight-day #NoMalarkey Tour across Iowa!  https://t.co/cGSblBnHoZ
1201296419987972096 2019-12-01 16:26:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congressman and former Admiral @JoeSestak has served his country bravely for decades. He ran his campaign with the same standards of strength and respect he has held his entire life. Thank you for your service.
1201255903498002432 2019-12-01 13:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every voter counts. We need a president who is ready to listen to every voice.  https://t.co/PAXhdgwCkm
1201226459278385154 2019-12-01 11:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Over the last 30 years, the fight against #HIV has taught us to be big-hearted; to follow the science; to treat everyone with dignity and respect, and to protect the human rights of all who walk this planet. #WorldAIDSDay  https://t.co/wOrUA8esbS
1200932522177122304 2019-11-30 16:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Eight years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of our nation. We cannot let that happen.  We must make him a one-term president.
1200923714331656192 2019-11-30 15:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's clear who President Trump works for. His administration prioritized giant tax cuts for the super-wealthy and corporations — meanwhile, they've attacked food assistance every chance they've gotten. It’s heartless.  No one should go hungry in America.  https://t.co/u1hFBMAufw
1200882191875465216 2019-11-30 13:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Fired up and ready to go for the #NoMalarkey barnstorm!  https://t.co/4lpU7waqzh

Wishing you joyous, colorful celebrations throughout the country filled with music, quality time with family, and all blessings for new beginnings — Nyob Zoo Xyoo Tshiab!
1200860146924175360 2019-11-30 11:32:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> 26 years ago, I fought to get the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act passed — and established the background check system that has kept guns out of the hands of so many dangerous individuals.  I’ve taken on the @NRA and beaten them — twice. As president, I’ll do it again.
1200840667087413249 2019-11-30 10:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, and every day, I encourage you to shop locally and support the folks in your community working hard every day. #SmallBusinessSaturday  https://t.co/aAvftiI1W7

1200557551617626112 2019-11-29 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every single community should have access to clean, safe drinking water. Period.  As president, I will stand up to the abuse of power by polluters who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities.  https://t.co/4zGTt7wkFS
1200535154193653760 2019-11-29 14:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's time we start rewarding work, not just wealth. As president, I'll reverse Trump's tax cuts for the super-wealthy and build a stronger, more inclusive middle class.
1200506968273805312 2019-11-29 12:09:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tomorrow, we’re kicking off our eight-day, 18 county “No Malarkey” barnstorm across Iowa! I’d love to see you there. Head to  https://t.co/qm53SbH51r to find an event in your community.  https://t.co/YngzAn9vKZ

1200459405226938370 2019-11-29 09:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I greatly admire the work of @NobelPrize laureate @DenisMukwege and @PanziHospital for raising awareness and caring for survivors of sexual violence in eastern Congo. We must end impunity for perpetrators. #16Days
1200438644974198790 2019-11-29 07:37:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you @JeanneShaheen for leading the fight to ensure that women veterans have the resources they need to be safe from violence. One of my top priorities as president will be to renew and expand VAWA — including passing this bill.
1200099533683736577 2019-11-28 09:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have so much to be thankful for — today and every day.

We hope your day is filled with family and friends, laughter, and gratitude.  https://t.co/Sp0NGh1aaC

1199777914373328897 2019-11-27 11:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Many of those seeking asylum on our southern border are fleeing horrific forms of gender-based violence. As president, I will restore asylum status for domestic violence survivors &amp; spearhead an initiative to end violence against women and girls in Central America. #16Days
1199758536663658497 2019-11-27 10:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Obamacare provided protections to over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. It was a huge step forward, but we can’t stop there. I’ll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care.
1199729596213669896 2019-11-27 08:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We cannot let President Trump define who we are as a nation. America is hopeful and inclusive — we give hate no safe harbor and leave no one behind. We are everything that Donald Trump is not.  https://t.co/98nSHN3hSJ
1199516945105637376 2019-11-26 18:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’ve got to build a stronger, more inclusive middle class.

1199498573655625729 2019-11-26 17:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s not enough to wish the world was better — we have to make it so. That belief has guided my life as it has Rev. Dr. Frantz Whitfield's. He’s a pillar of Iowa's faith community, and I’m grateful to have his support.  https://t.co/LulKAlCc3x
1199471394612023303 2019-11-26 15:34:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Prescription drug corporations are profiteering off of the pocketbooks of sick individuals — it’s wrong.   It’s time to stand up to this abuse of power – and I’m ready to take on the battle as president. Read my plan:  https://t.co/ysfLJKi5xY
1199452953037484032 2019-11-26 14:20:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'd love to, but it's right before the New Hampshire primary — I'll be busy talking to voters about how I'm going to beat Donald Trump. Come join me!  You can sign up to join our team here:  https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW
1199434028656529414 2019-11-26 13:05:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s going to take all hands on deck to reach our end of month goal — I’d really appreciate your help. Chip in what you can:  https://t.co/G9Sk0juyUt

1199394771359416322 2019-11-26 10:29:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> The next president will face the enormous challenge of picking up the pieces of America's broken foreign policy under President Trump.   There’s no time for on-the-job training. We need a leader who is ready on day one.  https://t.co/Ty6bEoNl96
1199158331987742720 2019-11-25 18:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> South Carolina’s Social Security number requirement is an unnecessary burden that discourages folks from participating in our political process. It's wrong and should be reversed.    We should be making voting easier — not harder.  https://t.co/VFXIRVnZON
1199146000566243328 2019-11-25 18:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm incredibly honored to have the endorsement of Tom and Christie Vilsack. I know with their support, we can win the Iowa caucus, earn the nomination, and beat Donald Trump next November.  https://t.co/dZqI2XrqUS
1199133166050693121 2019-11-25 17:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The American people are still waiting to see your tax returns, @realDonaldTrump. What are you hiding?
1199119324616617985 2019-11-25 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must get Donald Trump out of the White House. Once we do, we can:  - Combat climate change - Rebuild a more inclusive middle class - Protect and build on Obamacare - Ensure our government works for all Americans — not just the powerful
1199108251746521089 2019-11-25 15:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I promise you that @DrBiden and I will be the best partners and fiercest advocates in the White House for America’s educators and students.  https://t.co/wvI2e6TWb8
1199095417205673984 2019-11-25 14:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> One of my favorite parts of being on the campaign trail is meeting folks across the country and hearing their stories. That's why I want to sit down and have dinner with you—and yes, we can have ice cream for dessert!  Chip in for your chance to win:  https://t.co/7gIhLtJOvK  https://t.co/dnnpiKOIS5
1199067734820057093 2019-11-25 12:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need to face the facts on climate change: it’s already here and it poses an existential threat to our future.   There is no time to waste. On day one, I’ll take the bold action necessary to protect our planet for future generations.  https://t.co/3OcUfD0v6H
1199037535827030023 2019-11-25 10:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@realDonaldTrump, you're a serial liar and the most corrupt president in modern American history. I can hardly wait to take you on.  https://t.co/vjEiGWqllR
1199004568618782722 2019-11-25 08:39:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, I join leaders and activists around the world in recommitting to ending violence against women everywhere. Donald Trump has undermined American leadership — I'll restore it, and work to address gender-based violence in all its forms.  #IDEVAW  https://t.co/ip9f6tDwLc
1198764486481629189 2019-11-24 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our students and educators cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos.
1198710380018704384 2019-11-24 13:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s time we remember who we are as Americans: we treat each other with dignity, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor.
1198691757342560258 2019-11-24 11:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Weapons of war have no place in our communities.   I’ve successfully taken on the @NRA to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines before, and I’ll do it again in the White House.  https://t.co/AbTUKdY7Bv
1198425251551629312 2019-11-23 18:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m running for president to build an inclusive middle class where everyone comes along — regardless of race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability.
1198411913413177347 2019-11-23 17:24:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Four more years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of this nation. We cannot stand by and watch that happen.
1198401343758774273 2019-11-23 16:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Health care is one of the biggest issues in this election. As president, I will ensure health care is a right, not a privilege — and give everyone the peace of mind they deserve. Read my full plan:  https://t.co/ysfLJKi5xY
1198384231254233089 2019-11-23 15:34:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Climate change is an existential threat to our planet — we must take action.   As president, not only will I recommit us to the Paris Agreement — I’ll lead the world to up the ante in addressing our climate emergency.   https://t.co/VdZQbhS0D7
1198347693141172224 2019-11-23 13:08:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you Tom and Christie Vilsack for your support. Together, we will win Iowa and move this country forward.  https://t.co/zuZm2sdGvU
1198294389061079040 2019-11-23 09:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our hearts go out to the families of Iranian protesters who were killed this past week. Iranians, like people everywhere, have a right to protest peacefully without being brutally attacked by their own government and having the internet shut down for days. The world is watching.
1198265196696891393 2019-11-23 07:41:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Trump Administration’s “Infrastructure Weeks” are a joke — but our crumbling roads and bridges are not.  We need a transformational investment in America’s infrastructure and future:  https://t.co/hQHA5bqDAA  https://t.co/JkONIQrBcA
1198004478697304064 2019-11-22 14:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history. He has to go. If you agree, chip in $5 to help us make him a one-term president:  https://t.co/uUZdOjfTAk
1197986862809268224 2019-11-22 13:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re officially on the ballot in South Carolina!  https://t.co/Ij7GWwiMwe
1197964213836222464 2019-11-22 11:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This election is about who we are and who we want to be. I believe we are a nation that welcomes those fleeing persecution and seeking asylum — not a nation that turns our back on them.  https://t.co/qoVGCnGl21
1197956663895982080 2019-11-22 11:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Corruption is Donald Trump’s middle name.
1197938041395875840 2019-11-22 10:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need to build an economy that reflects our values.  My administration will reverse the Trump tax cuts for the super-wealthy and corporations. We'll then use that money to build a stronger, more inclusive middle class.
1197911366385844225 2019-11-22 08:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Obamacare was and is a big deal. It saved lives and gave millions peace of mind. We cannot afford to tear it down and start over — we should protect and build on it.  https://t.co/34NCSYzoUa
1197693177454419969 2019-11-21 17:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s clear that Donald Trump has abused the power of the presidency. Full stop.  He is the most corrupt president in modern American history.
1197655932030869504 2019-11-21 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Campbell is an incredible young man, and I’m proud to have played a small part in his journey.  https://t.co/vi1bGh3FjY
1197636051243655168 2019-11-21 14:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We had a great night at the #DemDebate, but we need your help to keep this momentum going.  Chip in $5 now:  https://t.co/gNyw13YQyR  https://t.co/TqWHFrM3IK

1197598554023325697 2019-11-21 11:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The White House is not a place for on-the-job training. I'll be ready on day one.
1197389174158118912 2019-11-20 21:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s keep the momentum from tonight’s #DemDebate going. If you’re on #TeamJoe, chip in $5:  https://t.co/JVUW2xcEqe.  https://t.co/cDFHzXIiaX
1197388324941553666 2019-11-20 21:36:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to speak out, and speak loudly, about violations of human rights. #DemDebate  https://t.co/FeVoveXqzZ
1197383767918305281 2019-11-20 21:18:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is the United States of America. There is not a single thing we have not been able to accomplish once we set our minds to it.  Let's take back this country and lead the world again. #DemDebate  https://t.co/te4M9fRGCE
1197371844439027713 2019-11-20 20:31:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> I just stepped off the #DemDebate stage, where I laid out my bold vision for our future and what's possible if we unite this country.   If I made you proud tonight, can you chip in $5 to help power our campaign:  https://t.co/c2tnkkgYBj
1197370824325550080 2019-11-20 20:27:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> That’s all we have! Thanks for tagging along for tonight’s #DemDebate. Make sure to follow @TeamJoe to stay up-to-date on everything happening on the campaign.
1197370557920137217 2019-11-20 20:26:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to fundamentally change the culture of how women are treated in this country. #DemDebate  https://t.co/bvrK6yPvcd
1197362095093882880 2019-11-20 19:52:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. Period.  As president, Joe Biden will stand up to attacks on a woman’s constitutional right to choose and enshrine Roe into federal law. #DemDebate
1197360689586851840 2019-11-20 19:46:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> "In the United States Senate, I passed more major legislation than everybody on this stage combined." #DemDebate  https://t.co/G8HYd8eFHA
1197360235763191808 2019-11-20 19:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Over the last few days, there has been a lot of misinformation on where Joe Biden stands when it comes to our marijuana laws. Read the facts below. #DemDebate  https://t.co/JEgMfuBgLQ
1197358233863819264 2019-11-20 19:37:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> 25 years ago Joe Biden led the fight to pass the Violence Against Women Act and as president he’s going to build on it. #DemDebate    https://t.co/UlBIhBCiiC  https://t.co/urNJjGEg23
1197357837070094336 2019-11-20 19:35:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> "It's the Attorney General of the United States — not the president's private attorney." #DemDebate  https://t.co/30yUe3jgCd
1197357488833794048 2019-11-20 19:34:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe will take on changing the culture on our college campuses that enables sexual violence, building on the #ItsOnUs effort he started with President Obama. #DemDebate   https://t.co/DKraGp9Cmi
1197354401754734593 2019-11-20 19:21:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> Human rights should be at the core of our engagement with the world--not the periphery. As president, Joe Biden will hold accountable Saudi Arabia, China, and every nation that violates the human rights of their citizens. #DemDebate
1197352195248791552 2019-11-20 19:13:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> Under President Trump, the North Korean nuclear threat is getting worse, not better. As President, Joe Biden will coordinate closely with our allies and hold China accountable for not putting pressure on North Korea. He'll see Kim Jong Un for what he is — a ruthless tyrant.
1197349700590096389 2019-11-20 19:03:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> More than anything, we need a president who can deliver on climate change. Joe Biden has a proven record of bringing people together to achieve real, lasting solutions — at home and abroad. #DemDebate
1197346362435756032 2019-11-20 18:49:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s not who we are. We are better than this. #DemDebate  https://t.co/Gyo93iKomX
1197343917982801920 2019-11-20 18:40:10 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe Biden is a statesman with decades of experience on the world stage who can repair our relationships around the world and is ready to command our armed forces on day one. #DemDebate
1197343449818812417 2019-11-20 18:38:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> The next president will face a monumental task cleaning up Trump's mess. Joe Biden is the best candidate on the debate stage to immediately get to work restoring America’s place in the world. Because he’s done it before. #DemDebate
1197340834691256320 2019-11-20 18:27:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe Biden’s health care plan will offer a new choice for Americans: keep your private insurance or choose a public option like Medicare. #DemDebate  https://t.co/Zy3E30WjYx
1197340086049882112 2019-11-20 18:24:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> In a Biden Administration, plans with lower deductibles will become more affordable, coverage will be extended to more Americans, and the roughly 5 million low-income Americans who were denied Medicaid by their governors and/or state legislatures will finally gain coverage.
1197339556103761921 2019-11-20 18:22:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s lay out the facts: More Americans prefer a public option over Medicare for All. #DemDebate  https://t.co/j7K3fRNu92
1197339210316943360 2019-11-20 18:21:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe Biden has the quickest, most effective plan to achieve universal health care coverage - at 1/30th the cost of Medicare for All. And, he doesn’t get rid of employer-based health care. #DemDebate
1197331414087278592 2019-11-20 17:50:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are fired up and ready for Joe to take the stage at tonight’s #DemDebate!  https://t.co/V0iGMuq3yu
1197330806701744128 2019-11-20 17:48:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hey folks, it’s @TeamJoe here! We’ll be taking over Joe’s account tonight to keep you updated on all things #DemDebate. Grab some ice cream and follow along!  https://t.co/uXTJmM0dJH
1197330057003458560 2019-11-20 17:45:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m about to take the stage for tonight’s #DemDebate, so I’m passing the account over to my team. They’ll keep you in the loop throughout the night on everything happening. Follow along here and on @TeamJoe for updates. Tune in to @MSNBC at 9 PM ET to watch live!
1197324594291658752 2019-11-20 17:23:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> @NRA The fight ahead of us is about more than just having plans. It’s about repairing our soul—and it will take someone with the proven ability to bring people together.  I've done it before—and at tonight's #DemDebate, I'm going to show you why I'm the best candidate to do it again.
1197324217135620096 2019-11-20 17:21:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> @NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the values America stands for on the world stage. Values that have been tarnished by Trump.  I’m the only one on tonight's stage ready to rebuild our global reputation and restore our moral leadership on day one.
1197323780080705543 2019-11-20 17:20:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> @NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the responsibility we have to our children to take on the threat of climate change.   I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who helped secure the Paris Agreement and the largest-ever U.S. investment in clean energy.
1197323318988279808 2019-11-20 17:18:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where we can look our kids in the eye and tell them: “You will be safe at school.”  I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has taken on the @NRA and won twice—and I can’t wait to do it again.
1197323089710866432 2019-11-20 17:17:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where no one has to worry about whether they can afford health care.  I fought like hell to get Obamacare passed and I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has led a transformation of our health care system.
1197322172638912518 2019-11-20 17:13:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> This election is about the soul of our nation—and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. He has no regard for our Constitution and violates everything we stand for. It’s not hyperbole to say that this is about saving America.   We have to decide who we are and who we want to be.
1197297067552464897 2019-11-20 15:34:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I give you my word as a Biden: I will never stoop to President Trump's level.  https://t.co/1CAhAjKEju
1197203981652639745 2019-11-20 09:24:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> I am deeply disturbed by the news coming out of my law school alma mater, Syracuse University. We are truly in a battle for the soul of this nation, and it requires all of us to stand up together as a country against racism and bigotry. We must give hate no safe harbor.
1197196655914733568 2019-11-20 08:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On this Transgender Day of Remembrance, we honor the memory of those we’ve lost—at least 22 trans and gender non-conforming people killed this year—and recommit to ridding this hate-filled violence from our society. Everyone deserves to live open and proud and free without fear.
1197185331138891778 2019-11-20 08:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Something is wrong in America when the average Latina makes just over half what the average non-Latino white man makes. Donald Trump has undone much of what we did in the White House to fix the gender pay gap. When I'm president, I'll work to right that wrong. #LatinaEqualPayDay
1196956324678033409 2019-11-19 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This election is about the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul.
1196943739182182400 2019-11-19 16:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know we can beat Donald Trump in 2020—but we can’t do it without your help. We’re relying on grassroots donors like you to power this campaign and get our country back on track.  Chip in today to help us meet our November fundraising goal:  https://t.co/1Ll6sjGzlE  https://t.co/eCGh2O7W6I
1196863208708956166 2019-11-19 10:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> What he said.  https://t.co/L7upW0b6sl
1196841817796268032 2019-11-19 09:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We know in our bones this election is different. If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation. We cannot let that happen.  We must make Trump a one-term president.  https://t.co/EuEVkE424E
1196621515007111168 2019-11-18 18:49:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> The energy at the @NVDems’ First in the West event was incredible. Folks are fired up to take back our country and make Donald Trump a one-term president.   If you’re fired up too, join our campaign today and let’s get to work:  https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW
1196609185854701568 2019-11-18 18:00:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> It has now been 264 days. How many more senseless shootings must occur before Senate Republicans take action? Enough is enough.
1196577576644415489 2019-11-18 15:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There is a lot of talk out there on where I stand when it comes to our marijuana laws. Here are the facts:  https://t.co/oaoExCXud8
1196548637137997826 2019-11-18 14:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve witnessed the heroism of firefighters firsthand — selflessly rushing into danger to help others. They represent the best of our country. @DrBiden and I send our condolences to the loved ones of Worcester Fire Lt. Jason Menard for their loss.  https://t.co/Oyru0eAhgq
1196531929522282498 2019-11-18 12:53:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> Sunday night in a backyard. Monday morning at a store. We must do everything in our power to end this gun violence epidemic because we cannot go on like this any longer.  Our hearts go out to those affected by these senseless tragedies.
1196514662285754372 2019-11-18 11:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m inspired by the strength and resilience of Chrissy and survivors across the country, and proud of the change the Violence Against Women Act created, but we still have further to go.  Today, I released my plan to build on VAWA:  https://t.co/UlBIhBCiiC  https://t.co/xR6QIvyBHW
1196492012779966465 2019-11-18 10:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> China’s internment of nearly one million Uighur Muslims is among the worst abuses of human rights in the world today. The U.S. cannot be silent — we must speak out against this oppression and relentlessly defend human rights around the world.  https://t.co/PQp04TWjyd
1196485218091356165 2019-11-18 09:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve spent my entire career fighting the abuse of power. That’s what motivated me to write &amp; champion the Violence Against Women Act. The law helped change our culture—but there’s more work to do.  Today, I’m releasing my plan to end violence against women: https://t.co/UlBIhBCiiC
1196238724734095360 2019-11-17 17:28:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> Corporations need to pay their fair share in taxes.   I’ll reverse Trump’s giveaway to the super-wealthy and corporations because it’s time we reward work, not just wealth.
1196226513152069632 2019-11-17 16:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know if we come together and stand united as a nation - anything is possible.  https://t.co/jltWLWkLP2
1196212672129318912 2019-11-17 15:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> At the CNN Town Hall, I was asked what changes in American society I’m proudest of. Here’s what I had to say:  https://t.co/X5OF6rwlJy
1196159823848456193 2019-11-17 12:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m running for president to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we have to bring everyone along regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.
1196133903104274432 2019-11-17 10:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The American people deserve to know what the most corrupt president in modern history is hiding in his tax returns.  https://t.co/QMMT8FEs3E
1196093459486191616 2019-11-17 07:51:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump's intervention in the American military justice system to pardon service members accused or convicted of war crimes betrays the rule of law, the values that make our country exceptional &amp; the men and women who wear the uniform honorably. He is not fit to command our troops.
1195861609505120256 2019-11-16 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Foreign Service Officers who testified this week represent the best of America. They deserve our support &amp; thanks for their work to advance American interests, not the scorn &amp; harassment they get from the President. Every day, Donald Trump reminds us he's unfit to serve.
1195852045837836292 2019-11-16 15:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My favorite part of running for president is talking with people about their lives. So my team and I are going to pick someone to fly out to come meet me on the trail and share a meal, all expenses on us.   If you want to grab dinner, chip in today:  https://t.co/vSvhBcO8Qa
1195829055091879936 2019-11-16 14:20:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> America is more equal because of Chief Justice Mark Cady. His landmark decision brought marriage equality to Iowa and pushed our nation closer to our highest ideals. @DrBiden and I send our condolences to his loved ones. His integrity and commitment to justice will be missed.
1195810019020664833 2019-11-16 13:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I am deeply concerned about the unjust detainment of Jose Daniel Ferrer, a voice for change in Cuba, by the Cuban government. Ferrer must be released at once.
1195778813633822720 2019-11-16 11:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Two elections. Zero criminal convictions.  https://t.co/fyy1DLOac9
1195750124204503040 2019-11-16 09:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every loss is different, but I've found that the way you can overcome enormous tragedy in your life is by finding purpose in your life.  https://t.co/AEAK19E8I4
1195495446074077184 2019-11-15 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump continues to undermine registered apprenticeships—programs that provide a path to the middle class &amp; a good union job. As president, I will work to save these important programs &amp; ensure every American has the skills they need to get ahead. #SaveApprenticeshipWeek
1195484121369382913 2019-11-15 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need more than thoughts and prayers. We need action. We have to protect our kids. Now.  https://t.co/gHJfA0UlH6
1195448637645418497 2019-11-15 13:09:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm proud to support @LREAintheRock and those fighting to ensure every child has access to the quality education they deserve.  https://t.co/EhNK7AZIsz
1195435048272629761 2019-11-15 12:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Couldn't have said it better myself.  https://t.co/VA5Aql9ZFY
1195412147343261696 2019-11-15 10:44:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe these impeachment hearings will conclude that Donald Trump is a threat to our national security. Every day he sits in the Oval Office is a dangerous day for the U.S.   If you agree, chip in to help us make Donald Trump a one-term president:  https://t.co/6JQ0ZLPPku  https://t.co/pHsFeeAlt0
1195387132338155521 2019-11-15 09:04:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we don’t get Donald Trump out of the White House and take urgent, drastic action to address the climate emergency, our planet may never recover.
1195370876147027970 2019-11-15 08:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to heal the divisions in this country. If we come together and act as one America, there is nothing that we cannot do.  https://t.co/sN9ojRF1Sc
1195182618364596224 2019-11-14 19:31:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@realDonaldTrump, release your taxes or shut up about corruption.
1195179861796626432 2019-11-14 19:20:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> This ugly ideology has no place in America—it is both offensive and dangerous that it has taken root in the White House. Stephen Miller must go now. Then we must ensure Trump is shown the door in 2020—and that his hateful ideology never again is given a voice in the Oval Office.
1195179601053601792 2019-11-14 19:19:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. We’ve always known that Donald Trump’s cruel immigration policies are a violation of our core American values. Now we know the architect of those policies has embraced and fanned the ugly flames of white nationalism.
1195150674813751298 2019-11-14 17:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We will beat the @NRA.  We will pass common-sense reforms.   We must end our gun violence epidemic.
1195144385249198080 2019-11-14 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Can you chip in five dollars to ensure our volunteers have the materials they need to talk with voters?  Donate here:  https://t.co/i3Zmf0O4KD  https://t.co/tyhma32QCL

1195087508003901440 2019-11-14 13:14:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If you like your private health insurance plan, you shouldn’t be forced to give it up. If you don't like it, you should be able to buy into a Medicare-like public option.  That's the choice I will give Americans as president.  https://t.co/sHkmn3mDxP
1195062594039627781 2019-11-14 11:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Another school shooting. How long will we go on like this? No kid should fear their safety in school &amp; no parent should worry whether their kid will come home.  Our hearts go out to Santa Clarita, but prayers aren't enough. We need real gun reform to make our schools safer.
1194994646448922624 2019-11-14 07:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump campaigned on repairing our nation’s crumbling infrastructure. But after countless “Infrastructure Weeks,” he has failed to deliver results. It has to change.  Today, I'm calling for a transformational investment in our nation's future:  https://t.co/mHG958ffo8
1194800869373612032 2019-11-13 18:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Affordable Care Act An assault weapons ban The Violence Against Women Act  There is no one in this race who has a stronger record of passing important, consequential legislation than I do. I know what it takes to get the job done.
1194787028077989888 2019-11-13 17:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The American people deserve to know what Donald Trump is hiding in his tax returns.
1194771928541581313 2019-11-13 16:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We cannot turn a blind eye to the atrocities President Trump continues to carry out at the border. This is not who we are.  https://t.co/KhV9ds0hNy
1194763120696160256 2019-11-13 15:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I will always choose hope over fear.  https://t.co/InWLyqOPpL
1194739213427781633 2019-11-13 14:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You shouldn't be forced to give up the health insurance and benefits that you fought for. Under my plan, you will be able to keep them.  https://t.co/lJZ9fvPWeV
1194729146582126593 2019-11-13 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This decision puts the health of the American people at risk — it’s unacceptable. We must get Donald Trump out of the White House and choose science over fiction once again.  https://t.co/YqVaGecPgQ
1194711530874515456 2019-11-13 12:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> First Trump gave a green light to Erdogan to ethnically cleanse Kurds who helped us defeat ISIS. Now he welcomes Erdogan with open arms and sweetheart deals. It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that, once again, Trump’s personal interests, not US interests, are driving his policy.
1194696431409356800 2019-11-13 11:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to lead the world by our example and make clear that human rights, civil rights, and civil liberties matter to us.  https://t.co/Ma26IxrInO
1194672523750674433 2019-11-13 09:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every American deserves access to affordable, quality health care, and Obamacare’s open enrollment is happening now.

1194425898465972226 2019-11-12 17:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The next president will face an enormous challenge of picking up the pieces of America’s foreign policy and salvaging our reputation.  I'm the only candidate in this race ready for that job on day one — and 133 top foreign policy officials agree.  https://t.co/4c2Le1VIJV
1194416335637360642 2019-11-12 16:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Change starts at the local level — I learned that firsthand as a 28-year-old on the New Castle County Council. On #NationalRunforOfficeDay, I'm asking you to join me and run for something. There is too much at stake in 2020 to sit on the sidelines.  https://t.co/cEgKOoVhVI
1194412057560436737 2019-11-12 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump's erratic, impulsive decisions threaten our national security and set our world on edge. Every day that he sits in the Oval Office is a dangerous day for the United States.  https://t.co/QcUR5hVCdJ
1194384374902312962 2019-11-12 14:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every worker should have the chance to join a union which bargains to ensure they get paid a living wage and have protections against sexual harassment. That's why I'm proud to stand with @McDonalds workers who are striking in Detroit and across the country today.  https://t.co/r0y6uDM2na
1194367262284828678 2019-11-12 13:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Israel has a right to defend itself against terrorist threats. It is intolerable that Israeli civilians live their lives under the constant fear of rocket attacks. That's why our administration was such a strong supporter of Israel's life-saving Iron Dome.  https://t.co/aQOUdKZqq7
1194360467675848704 2019-11-12 13:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> DREAMers should be treated like the Americans that they are. It's past time for Congress to provide a pathway to citizenship and a fair shot at the American dream. #HomeIsHere  https://t.co/9CcEn8BUsm
1194339670626144257 2019-11-12 11:42:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Sandy Hook families who paid such a bitter price deserve their day in court – and all American families deserve laws that protect them, and that put their children, not big gun corporations, first.
1194328129264852993 2019-11-12 10:56:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I want to extend our best wishes to our friends in the Sikh community who are observing the 550th anniversary of the birth of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of Sikhism.  https://t.co/ojTCj2SR1j
1194317654485602307 2019-11-12 10:14:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> DREAMers know more about what it means to be an American than you ever will.
1194291151248986113 2019-11-12 08:29:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I will ensure DREAMers are recognized as the Americans they are. In the meantime, the Supreme Court should overturn Donald Trump’s cruel decision so that DREAMers can continue to live fully in the only country they have ever known. Their #HomeIsHere.
1194112965353627648 2019-11-11 20:41:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> I just finished tonight’s CNN Town Hall, where I laid out my vision for our future and how I’ll deliver real progress for working families.

1194109586594312192 2019-11-11 20:28:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump has violated his oath of office and betrayed our nation. He should be impeached.  https://t.co/4YWvi0HLxh

1194070842059214849 2019-11-11 17:54:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> Looking forward to joining @ErinBurnett for tonight’s town hall in Iowa to discuss what’s at stake in this election and why I’m running for president. Tune in to @CNN at 9 PM ET to watch live.
1194066544885731329 2019-11-11 17:37:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our veterans and their families represent the absolute best that our country has to offer. I had the honor of spending Veterans Day in Iowa with a few of them.  https://t.co/ziNM4qRHL2
1194053444337885184 2019-11-11 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The campaign trail is always more fun when you join, @DrBiden. What a great weekend in New Hampshire!  https://t.co/5zX5CZjM3N
1194047153045299201 2019-11-11 16:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump has repeatedly failed our veterans, and our sacred obligation as a nation: to properly prepare and equip our troops when we send them into harm’s way, and care for them and their families.   As president, I will meet our sacred obligation.  https://t.co/TCUYaKtz8l
1194001854604234752 2019-11-11 13:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We owe our veterans more than we could ever repay — and it’s our sacred obligation to care for them and their families when they return home.  Thank you to all who have served — on Veterans Day and every day.  https://t.co/SQBUj8nwmw
1193985496533196805 2019-11-11 12:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I understand the sleepless nights, wondering if your deployed child is safe, and all the added sacrifices military families face because their loved one chose selfless service.  As president, I'll take care of our troops and their families.  https://t.co/iNuNHlPsg1
1193973920325615619 2019-11-11 11:29:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Less than 1% of our population risks everything to protect our country — the other 99% of us owe them more than we could ever repay. #VeteransDay  https://t.co/ChF786cRlO
1193946489854124032 2019-11-11 09:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, I’m releasing my plan to ensure our veterans receive what they deserve: our respect and enduring gratitude, and the benefits they have earned.    Read my full plan:  https://t.co/TCUYaKtz8l
1193926357346082817 2019-11-11 08:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The most sacred obligation of our government is to do right by the men and women who defend our nation at war. Veterans Day offers us a moment to reflect on that obligation, and to recommit ourselves to all that it truly means.  https://t.co/X0YAR8r3Xj
1193699864577626113 2019-11-10 17:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Together we can, and will, make Donald Trump a one-term president.
1193681493421248512 2019-11-10 16:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We don’t say it enough — Barack Obama was a great president. And I’m proud to have worked alongside him.  https://t.co/5pIZxkNxyj
1193658844229988355 2019-11-10 14:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> HBCUs and MSIs play a vital role in our communities. As president, I’ll invest $70 billion in these institutions to improve affordability, build high tech labs and facilities, and support student success.  Read my full plan:  https://t.co/MxizpNiekL
1193639718069530624 2019-11-10 13:21:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m running for president to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild its backbone — the middle class, and unify all Americans.  If you’re with me, join us:  https://t.co/qN0D1vhO9N
1193621598898548736 2019-11-10 12:09:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The ACA was, and is, a big deal. It took generations of presidents trying to expand health care access, and President Obama and I got it done.   I’ll fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to tear it down—Republican or Democrat.
1193578817127899138 2019-11-10 09:19:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There is no denying the devastating effects climate change has on our planet — we need to take action.   As president, I’ll lead the world in addressing the climate emergency. Read my plan at  https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo.  https://t.co/hHMvdBHLY3
1193343686022770689 2019-11-09 17:44:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thirty years ago today, the people of Berlin tore down a wall and vanquished a dictatorship. We must not forget the lessons of 1989. The United States must reclaim its mantle as the champion of democracy. The stakes are simply too high.  https://t.co/3LkGwfzp6U
1193329171792977920 2019-11-09 16:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Because a union fought for their private health insurance plan, Marcy and her husband were able to retire with dignity and respect. That’s why my plan to protect and build on Obamacare will give folks the option to choose what’s best for them.  https://t.co/jtOPJDnE30
1193306522647838720 2019-11-09 15:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My plan to build on Obamacare will expand health care coverage and lower costs — without raising taxes on the middle class.  Proponents of Medicare for All can't say the same. Read my full plan:  https://t.co/ysfLJK0u9o
1193271531562000387 2019-11-09 12:57:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> A fresh Fall day in New Hampshire spent serving chili to our nation’s finest — firefighters.  https://t.co/9BRPyeDkLk
1193235303617748993 2019-11-09 10:34:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Health care is a right. Every American should have the peace of mind that comes from access to affordable health care, and we can get there by protecting and building on Obamacare.
1193208375959379968 2019-11-09 08:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to start rewarding work, not wealth. As president, I will build a stronger, more inclusive middle class — not cut taxes for the super wealthy.
1193002267911294979 2019-11-08 19:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Kids shouldn’t have to worry about their safety while they’re at school. Together — we’ll put an end to our gun violence epidemic.  https://t.co/LvfaqNbpz7
1192941637921579008 2019-11-08 15:07:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> This anniversary is not only a reminder of the cruelty these communities, especially Latinos, have tirelessly faced, but it is also a testament to their steadfast resilience in the face of prejudice to spark change, in California and across our country.
1192941636717891584 2019-11-08 15:07:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> 25 years ago, California approved Prop. 187 — a measure designed to strategically disenfranchise immigrant communities by stripping away access to health care and education.
1192915697397043200 2019-11-08 13:24:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump’s trade war is reckless, and hurting our farmers every day.  https://t.co/l1BIi9ffHm
1192890784988696576 2019-11-08 11:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s official — we’re on the ballot in New Hampshire.   Join us:  https://t.co/qN0D1vzpyn.  https://t.co/UcwiuobICO
1192856306110984193 2019-11-08 09:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every kid deserves a quality education and every family deserves to live in a safe, healthy community. That's why I support the California #SchoolsAndCommunitiesFirst initiative that will make corporations pay their fair share and invest in our communities to help them thrive.
1192630065210650624 2019-11-07 18:29:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m more optimistic about our future today than I was when I got elected to the Senate as a 29-year-old. If we unite this country, America’s best days still lie ahead.  If you agree, chip in today:  https://t.co/ybhgvXSyRD
1192624528754696193 2019-11-07 18:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I led the successful fight in the 1980s to stop Jeff Sessions’ nomination for a federal judgeship. I hope the people of Alabama will stop him from rejoining the Senate next year.
1192598356280762368 2019-11-07 16:23:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As California continues to burn, President Trump wants to withhold critical aid and abandon our firefighters when they need our support the most. It's reckless and cruel.  We must act now on climate change and support our firefighters and those affected by this disaster.  https://t.co/EahL0fozXo
1192574197312061441 2019-11-07 14:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The courage and determination of folks like @fred_guttenberg have turned the fight for gun safety reform from a cause to a movement.  Together, we will beat the @NRA and end our gun violence epidemic.  https://t.co/IeJ4yOQ16q
1192546011559784449 2019-11-07 12:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump wants to talk about corruption? That’s rich coming from the most corrupt president in modern history.  Tell Trump to release his taxes or shut up about corruption:  https://t.co/hc4cbU9CL8  https://t.co/ozhDumIxsv
1192531667086393345 2019-11-07 11:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Getting the Violence Against Women Act passed is one of the highlights of my whole career. Now Senate Republicans are refusing to reauthorize it. To all the advocates and survivors speaking out - your voice makes all the difference. It always has. So keep it up. #VAWA4ALL
1192504487933464576 2019-11-07 10:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’ve come too far with the Affordable Care Act to tear it down and start over. Building on Obamacare with a new public option is the best way to lower costs and achieve universal coverage.  https://t.co/QbdijSL0se
1192281015299035136 2019-11-06 19:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Proud to stand with the @GeneralMills @RWDSU members in their fight for a fair contract. Every worker deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages, good benefits, and job security.
1192252830276415488 2019-11-06 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he proves how unfit he is to lead our country. We cannot give him eight years in the White House.
1192245280747511808 2019-11-06 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Last night's results showed that Democrats can take back our country, starting with Virginia, and begin the hard work of growing a stronger, more inclusive middle class and restoring the soul of our nation.  Chip in to help us take back the White House:  https://t.co/Z9v6FGZH0r
1192236220178403329 2019-11-06 16:24:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm running for president to unite this country. There's nothing we cannot do if we do it together.  https://t.co/RnwM8UEVUq
1192183371931275264 2019-11-06 12:54:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If you have DACA status, and it expires within the year, it’s critical that you renew as soon as possible to protect your status until we find a permanent solution.  DREAMers are Americans — and it’s time we make it official. #HomeIsHere  https://t.co/EIxZz19kfv
1192157702916431872 2019-11-06 11:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hottest summer on record: 2019 Hottest September on record: 2019 Hottest October on record: 2019  There is no time to waste. We must get Donald Trump out of the White House and address the climate emergency. The survival of our planet depends on it.  https://t.co/0ex6xguIIQ
1192138073393397761 2019-11-06 09:54:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To the millions of people who get up every single day and make this country work: I see you, and I will never stop fighting for you. You are the backbone of America.  https://t.co/GdCmhoKtT8
1192090510544031744 2019-11-06 06:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congratulations to Governor-Elect @AndyBeshearKY on his hard-earned victory. He has served the people of Kentucky well as attorney general — the Commonwealth is in good hands with him in the governor's office.
1191928063581466625 2019-11-05 19:59:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight, by voting in Democratic majorities in both chambers of the General Assembly, Virginians sent a clear, powerful message that will resonate across this nation and shake the walls of the White House.  https://t.co/78UbWLWX4h
1191887960884559872 2019-11-05 17:20:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> The growing mountain of evidence makes one thing clear: We must impeach Donald Trump.
1191857222956933120 2019-11-05 15:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I have fought for the Democratic Party my whole career. That’s not something everyone in this primary can say.  https://t.co/JCNqAlbSo0
1191856467877474304 2019-11-05 15:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Obamacare protects over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions — including Joe and Michelle’s son Matt. We cannot afford to tear it down and start over. We should protect and build on it.  https://t.co/yX6jDCg8fG
1191845646711439360 2019-11-05 14:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ten years ago today at Fort Hood. Two years ago in Sutherland Springs. In total, 39 lives taken because of our gun violence epidemic. We must honor the memory of those we lost with concrete action on gun safety reform.
1191830044676481024 2019-11-05 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump's Cuba policy hurts families on &amp; off the island. Administrations of both parties have supported family reunification, and I support @DebbieforFL &amp; @DonnaShalala's work to reunite Cuban families. As president, I will reinstate the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program.
1191792297907613696 2019-11-05 11:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Proud to stand with folks in Las Vegas fighting against a proposed ordinance that effectively criminalizes homelessness. Like we did in the Obama-Biden Administration, we should focus on providing housing first and work to find long-term solutions to end homelessness.
1191773421018812423 2019-11-05 09:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The U.S. is the strongest nation in the world not just because of the example of our power, but also because of the power of our example.  That’s what has always set us apart on the world stage, and that’s something Donald Trump will never understand.  https://t.co/omaa5OTMc0
1191743221715607553 2019-11-05 07:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Faith, hope, and dignity sound good to me.  https://t.co/iVd6fc3qTy
1191720572427751426 2019-11-05 06:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today is Election Day in Kentucky, Mississippi, New Jersey, Virginia, and cities across the nation. Your vote matters — find your polling place, bring a friend, and head to the polls to make your voice heard:  https://t.co/841UwMNWxp
1191520469570244609 2019-11-04 16:59:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> 11 years ago tonight.  https://t.co/WZOSk0QOGB
1191500021062963200 2019-11-04 15:38:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> 250 days. @Senatemajldr McConnell, do your job and bring the universal background check bill up for a vote.
1191482414398394369 2019-11-04 14:28:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve released 21 years of my tax returns — why hasn’t President Trump?  He should release his taxes or shut up about corruption.
1191466397655818243 2019-11-04 13:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As the climate crisis worsens each day and California burns and Iowa floods, Trump continues to abandon science and our international leadership. He just notified the United Nations of our official withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. It's shameful.  https://t.co/5UikQrsS3u
1191431165686747138 2019-11-04 11:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump has turned his back on those he promised to help. He thinks he’s being tough with his trade war, but he’s really being reckless. And American workers are paying the price.   I will ensure our policies put American workers first.  https://t.co/oui5atVxXl
1191404741470781448 2019-11-04 09:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A country that ignores the threat to the very survival of this planet isn’t just troubled — it’s morally bankrupt.  We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and take urgent action to address the climate emergency.
1191370012826755078 2019-11-04 07:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Is anyone surprised that all it takes is a $100 saw to breach Trump’s wall? This whole exercise was a stunt and a sham from the beginning. The only thing the wall has succeeded in doing is tarnishing the image of our nation in the eyes of the world.  https://t.co/9d8lNoCEth
1191182469434880000 2019-11-03 18:36:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is a dangerous decision by the Trump Administration. We should be strengthening our clean water protections and holding polluters accountable for their actions — not loosening restrictions on toxic waste.
1191165061232021504 2019-11-03 17:27:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> This Tuesday, we have the opportunity to set an example for the nation  and turn the Virginia state legislature blue. But only if everyone turns out to vote:  https://t.co/ZsLycRC1bv  https://t.co/TVtZJQR9hI
1191153082954067974 2019-11-03 16:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 100 days until the New Hampshire primary. One year until Election Day 2020.  There’s no time to waste, chip in $5 now to help us make Donald Trump a one-term president:  https://t.co/4Y0hGTrRTg  https://t.co/QSSsgFZ8iJ
1191125400610594816 2019-11-03 14:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In a Biden administration, we will lower health care costs and achieve universal coverage — and we will do it without raising taxes on the middle class.  https://t.co/gm6jgUINzt
1191113069495123969 2019-11-03 14:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump's decision to close America's doors to refugees fleeing persecution is cruel and shortsighted. As president, I will restore America's historic commitment to welcoming those whose lives are threatened by conflict and crisis.  https://t.co/74BfkIbBPd
1191100234849554433 2019-11-03 13:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> With just 100 days until the New Hampshire primary, we need your help to grow our grassroots team and talk with voters in every corner of the Granite State.  Join us:  https://t.co/GCxsKwFY4h  https://t.co/8W26ixL39p
1191080605464715264 2019-11-03 11:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In one year, we will give Trump a nickname of his own: Former President Donald Trump.
1191032287007084545 2019-11-03 08:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have one year to determine the mark Donald Trump will leave on our country. There's too much at stake to take the next year for granted. We must work together to take back the White House, win the Senate, hold the House and elect Democrats down the ballot. #OneYearOneTeam
1190821258667184128 2019-11-02 19:41:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> Progress is bringing people together to get real results. It’s not accusing someone of being a Republican because they don’t share your approach to achieving universal health care. I know what it takes to get things done. I fought to pass Obamacare — I will fight to build on it.
1190800509868871681 2019-11-02 18:19:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The greed of drug companies fueled the opioid epidemic that has ravaged communities in every corner of the country. It’s time we hold pharmaceutical companies accountable.  https://t.co/bVjnbAskhr
1190774773854461952 2019-11-02 16:36:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our military deserves a commander-in-chief who ensures they have what they need when we send them into harm's way. Donald Trump betrays this sacred obligation. By abandoning partners who risk everything to stand at our side, Trump makes every future mission harder for our troops.
1190766925904859137 2019-11-02 16:05:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> No American should be denied shelter, medical care, or critical services because of who they are or who they love. As president, I will reverse these cruel and discriminatory acts from @realDonaldTrump and @mike_pence, and I'll start by signing the Equality Act into law.
1190755746188791809 2019-11-02 15:21:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> The majority of middle class Americans don't think their kids will have the same standard of living they have — that's never happened before. Under my administration, every American will have a fighting shot.  https://t.co/6QituGhlka
1190705322295463937 2019-11-02 12:00:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> Once Donald Trump is out of the way, there is nothing we can’t do.  https://t.co/LBk2gxdaTr
1190680760132481029 2019-11-02 10:23:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> It all starts in Iowa, on February 3rd. Together, we're going to take this nation back from Donald Trump.  https://t.co/9G1dQfBEzi
1190635254559711237 2019-11-02 07:22:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> First thing I will do as president is rejoin the Paris Climate Accord and rally the world to push our progress further and faster. #LJ19  https://t.co/oo1jgDBk0M
1190462029477416963 2019-11-01 19:54:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can ensure every American has access to the quality, affordable health care they need — and we can do it without taxing the middle class. #LJ19  https://t.co/c5svZ6pUvz
1190451661887672320 2019-11-01 19:12:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must get Donald Trump out of office. Once we do, the road is clear for significant change. #LJ19  https://t.co/OdaH2JXoik
1190441645273223168 2019-11-01 18:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The #TeamJoe energy at tonight’s #LJ19 Celebration was incredible. With just 94 days until the Iowa Caucus, we need your help to build the strongest campaign possible.  Chip in $5 today:  https://t.co/B5b58W9VNz

1190415472803627013 2019-11-01 16:49:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Together, we will win Iowa, win this nomination, and beat Donald Trump. #LJ19  Join us:  https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW  https://t.co/qOJDxtVjjs
1190409181406355457 2019-11-01 16:24:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the wake of tragedy in his hometown, @BetoORourke responded with compassion and leadership, looking into the eyes of people who just lost loved ones and pledging his total resolve. His passion for solving our gun crisis has been inspiring to anyone who has seen him.
1190390428140331009 2019-11-01 15:09:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m about to join #TeamJoe at our #LJ19 Celebration Pre-Party in Des Moines, Iowa. Tune in to watch live:  https://t.co/fHa6WSpU0n
1190376717606674433 2019-11-01 14:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The values of patriotism, friendship, and faith that Scranton instilled in me have defined my entire life — and they’re the values I’ll bring to the White House.  https://t.co/Gf7kJ5E4Zs
1190367406138560512 2019-11-01 13:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To every military family in our country: thank you, thank you, thank you.  https://t.co/aFycPRFNoB
1190322610850025472 2019-11-01 10:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The next president will inherit a world in disarray. There’s no time for on-the-job training — I’ll be ready on day one.
1190308769806372864 2019-11-01 09:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must stop penalizing and criminalizing poverty.  https://t.co/b50g289r7a
1190297697003212800 2019-11-01 09:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When it comes to health care, many Americans can't afford to wait for far off promises. Obamacare's open enrollment begins today. Head to  https://t.co/2Ls3d80By6 to find an affordable, quality plan that works best for you. #GetCovered
1190283604074496000 2019-11-01 08:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Together, we will beat Donald Trump like a drum. #LJ19  Join us:  https://t.co/gnaFCAUzju  https://t.co/0LYg1TsGiN
1190082267500236800 2019-10-31 18:44:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ll see you tomorrow.
1190080515916935169 2019-10-31 18:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight in Iowa, a teacher asked me what my top priorities would be as president. Here's what I told him:  https://t.co/LP7556f4sE
1190074727542321152 2019-10-31 18:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> One of my great honors as Vice President was speaking at the Air Force Academy commencement. We need a President who respects our troops.  https://t.co/KjtuyqWSUa
1190061350803951617 2019-10-31 17:21:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> I did. It made clear that you pressured a foreign government to interfere in our political process on your behalf. You violated your oath of office and betrayed our nation.  You should be impeached.
1190056356599877632 2019-10-31 17:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know it’s Halloween, but Donald Trump has really been scaring me lately.   Chip in $5 if he’s scaring you too:  https://t.co/tk6P0aq4iI
1190052078317686786 2019-10-31 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The American people can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump’s art of no deals.
1190044528591429632 2019-10-31 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Happy Halloween from the entire Biden family! We hope your night is filled with few tricks and plenty of treats.  https://t.co/BVlT681L53
1190011345258856463 2019-10-31 14:03:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump is undermining our health care and trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act at every turn. As a result, 400,000 additional children are uninsured. It’s cruel.  I will protect and build on Obamacare to ensure every American has access to the care they need.
1190001998218661888 2019-10-31 13:26:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@DrBiden and I are grateful for the brave first responders working around the clock to contain the California fires. Our thoughts are with the Californians affected by the fires; our prayers will be for your safety.  https://t.co/q4PKFvKnL5
1189992199221633024 2019-10-31 12:47:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> Sorry America, the correct answer is Snickers.
1189977839325655048 2019-10-31 11:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congress must do its duty to ensure that Donald Trump's assault on the Constitution does not seep beyond his presidency, with a lasting and devastating impact on our democracy.  https://t.co/6zBWnwEpxI
1189904861556547587 2019-10-31 07:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> The super-wealthy don’t need another tax cut. Period.  My administration will repeal the Trump tax cuts for the super-wealthy and reward work, not just wealth.  https://t.co/jeNEA1TUjW
1189680882350723073 2019-10-30 16:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump's erratic foreign policy has abandoned our allies, abdicated our leadership, and tarnished our reputation. It has to stop.  In a Biden administration, America will once again lead by example and rally the world to meet our common challenges.  https://t.co/qPHYk6SaDF
1189665529444937728 2019-10-30 15:08:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our planet cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump in the White House.
1189639862082834442 2019-10-30 13:27:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m not afraid to say the word union. America’s unions built the middle class — and in a Biden administration, we’ll work alongside them to rebuild it.  https://t.co/VZnCFtAEEB
1189631054153428999 2019-10-30 12:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are at a crucial moment. We can survive four years of Donald Trump, but if we give him eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation. We cannot let that happen.  Chip in to help us make Trump a one-term president:  https://t.co/swNOgJE8EM
1189614001472397317 2019-10-30 11:44:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman’s testimony made clear what we already knew: Donald Trump pressured Ukraine to interfere in our elections on his behalf and the White House tried to cover it up.  We cannot let Trump get away with this abuse of power. He must be impeached.
1189572921372622849 2019-10-30 09:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump’s reckless trade war is hurting farmers like Kevin—enough is enough.  Our farmers can't afford four more years of a leader who delivers nothing but empty promises. As president, I’ll stand up to China and pursue a trade policy that prioritizes American workers.  https://t.co/4BvAhlRVoy
1189562603158114307 2019-10-30 08:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Proud to stand in solidarity with @TWULocal100 and @Transportworker in their fight for a fair contract. The 40,000+ bus and subway workers who move New York deserve the dignity that comes with fair wages, good benefits, and job security. #TWUrally2019
1189543982294016000 2019-10-30 07:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve seen firsthand how hard educators work with little pay and few resources. We must do better. A Biden administration will ensure our educators finally receive the pay and dignity they deserve.  https://t.co/lvtfAz1xIE
1189360535269191680 2019-10-29 18:57:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> With Trump, it’s always all about him. It's all about beating his chest about what he's done, the stable genius that he is. We need a real leader.
1189342402181390336 2019-10-29 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> After almost three years on the job, Donald Trump is still unprepared to lead the world and unfit to lead our country. To clean up his mess, we need a leader who doesn't require on the job training. I'm prepared to get to work on day one.  https://t.co/k8D0gRVzP1
1189337368894918656 2019-10-29 17:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office is a dangerous day for the United States. His erratic, impulsive decisions threaten our standing in the world and make us all less safe.  https://t.co/8FqfCPE7Rv
1189327302733238272 2019-10-29 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Some Americans celebrate #NationalCatDay, some celebrate #NationalDogDay — President Trump celebrates neither. It says a lot.  It’s time we put a pet back in the White House.  https://t.co/6za6FUocfh
1189314719791763457 2019-10-29 15:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> For too long, corporations have stifled workers’ right to organize and collectively bargain for the pay and benefits they deserve.  That ends with a Biden administration.  We will hold corporations and executives personally accountable for interfering with the rights of workers.
1189302136930295812 2019-10-29 15:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Seven years ago, Hurricane Sandy devastated the East Coast. As we remember those we lost, we must renew our commitment to addressing climate change. Extreme storms will only become more frequent and powerful if we don’t take urgent action to tackle this crisis.  https://t.co/9TK6aBdoyx
1189294083669254145 2019-10-29 14:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I welcome the House’s passage of H Res 296, which recognizes and condemns the Armenian Genocide of 1915-23. By acknowledging this genocide we honor the memory of its victims and vow: never again.
1189274454741995520 2019-10-29 13:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Filipino-American History Month is an important opportunity to honor the rich history of the Filipino-American community, including the legacy of brave Filipino veterans who fought in World War II, and all the ways they strengthen our nation.
1189229156258594816 2019-10-29 10:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congratulations to the teachers of Dedham, Massachusetts, on a successful strike and for securing a fair contract. It's past time we support our educators by giving them the pay and dignity they deserve.  https://t.co/IaQtKGn8wl
1189207765039734785 2019-10-29 08:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Paying off your kids' student loan debt can feel overwhelming. We need a president who understands that.  https://t.co/VnCrEGh5mx
1189180586042318848 2019-10-29 07:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 1% of Americans put their lives on the line to defend the other 99% of us — we owe so much to our military men and women and their families. We must do better by those who sacrifice everything in service to our nation.  https://t.co/4JPY5wzs14
1188975484278845440 2019-10-28 17:27:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In a Biden administration, our:  - Secretary of Education will be an educator - EPA Administrator will know climate change is real - Attorney General will defend the Constitution, not the president
1188966500557824000 2019-10-28 16:51:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ten years ago, President Obama and I championed and signed into law the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.  As president, I'll enforce our nation’s hate crime laws, reverse Trump’s cruel and discriminatory acts, and sign the Equality Act into law.
1188956106573266944 2019-10-28 16:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> With less than 100 days until the Iowa Caucus, we need your help to build the strongest grassroots operation possible to win the nomination and make Donald Trump a one-term president.  Chip in what you can today:  https://t.co/hygEOhiacs
1188943523678081024 2019-10-28 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is not who we are. And as a nation, we will prove that next November. Families belong together.  https://t.co/dvYvFuB0Vq
1188912756868763650 2019-10-28 13:17:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> If President Trump had ever visited our troops serving in Afghanistan, he would know this isn't true.
1188900742456926208 2019-10-28 12:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump has no strategy for securing our nation against terrorist threats. He has no strategy for anything. Every day that he directs American national security is a dangerous day for the United States.
1188885642601590784 2019-10-28 11:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Kay Hagan was a courageous soul who lived every day of her too-short life with incredible dignity and character, even as the days became more difficult physically. Jill and I are deeply saddened by this news and extend our condolences to her entire family.  https://t.co/XBqATmVRec
1188860476756758529 2019-10-28 09:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Russians don't want me to be president, and Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee. But they picked a fight with the wrong guy — I’m not going anywhere.  We will make Donald Trump a one-term president.  https://t.co/OrszKw9Up8
1188638010587451395 2019-10-27 19:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No American President should welcome foreign interference in our elections.  https://t.co/fKzqhS9EC7
1188628951096279042 2019-10-27 18:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump.  https://t.co/KInHL475Gt
1188614606408900609 2019-10-27 17:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is the United States of America — if we pick our heads up and remember who we are, there’s not a single thing we can’t do.  https://t.co/x6H0KDWpVK
1188543135502098432 2019-10-27 12:49:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight on @60minutes I’ll lay out what I believe we need to do to ensure that America’s word means something again on the world stage. Tune in at 7pm ET.
1188538516231413765 2019-10-27 12:30:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> I couldn’t agree more, @Springsteen.
1188521492939603968 2019-10-27 11:23:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To all those taking part in the Festival of Lights, Jill and I send warm wishes for a joyous celebration — Happy Diwali and Saal Mubarak.  https://t.co/Lyrb65QmOZ
1188511929813200898 2019-10-27 10:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, we remember the lives taken one year ago at the Tree of Life Synagogue. We must constantly strive to live up to the American ideal that we're all created equal, while facing the harsh reality that hate has long torn us apart. The battle isn't over. We must end this hate.
1188474466155802624 2019-10-27 08:16:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> I congratulate our special forces, our intelligence community, and all our brave military professionals on delivering justice to the terrorist Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The world is better and safer without him in it.  https://t.co/miLSVWBT9l
1188458578383794176 2019-10-27 07:13:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump and his administration have no idea what hard-working, decent, ordinary Americans are going through. They don’t understand the middle class. I do.  https://t.co/r9t8xP5coN
1188255543682568193 2019-10-26 17:46:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> Institutional racism should no longer exist. As president, I'll put forward change to help put an end to it.  https://t.co/DQtPzGIfNq
1188218137080225793 2019-10-26 15:17:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> Even the dog knows that we can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump.  https://t.co/AEZhBIoq0Y
1188199370463821824 2019-10-26 14:03:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If you work hard, you should be able to share in the prosperity. That basic bargain is broken — it's time we restore it for all American workers.  My plan will ensure all workers can bargain for the pay, benefits and workplace protections they deserve.  https://t.co/nDK9O3fyly
1188179741037207554 2019-10-26 12:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We only have 100 days left until the Iowa Caucus. Chip in what you can to help us restore the soul of our nation:  https://t.co/jevK0T1Fj8  https://t.co/wP4D0H4EQC
1188167409657499648 2019-10-26 11:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump promised he would work for the forgotten American — instead, he’s forgotten about them.  From day one, my administration will be focused on building an inclusive middle class to ensure everyone has a fair shot at a better future.  https://t.co/9L4RuKrzkg
1188138469328965632 2019-10-26 10:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We only have 100 days left until the Iowa Caucus — and we need your help to organize and grow our team. Add your name to say you're ready to join the fight:  https://t.co/GCxsKwomFH.  https://t.co/YMZ7eCSuPD
1188129352258588673 2019-10-26 09:24:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> I am proud to stand with the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, and the contributions they have made to America's rich diversity.

1187892347293573121 2019-10-25 17:43:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There’s a war being waged on organized labor — and it’s only getting worse with President Trump in the White House.   As president, I'll strengthen organizing and collective bargaining rights to strengthen unions. If you’re with me, join my campaign:  https://t.co/giATOhj44a
1187880267635216384 2019-10-25 16:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Wall Street did not build the middle class — unions did. As president, I’ll ensure that workers are treated with dignity and respect. All workers must receive the pay, benefits and workplace protections they deserve. Read my plan:  https://t.co/c4MyVLMxlD.  https://t.co/ZHANcO7ghm
1187849484417536003 2019-10-25 14:52:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@SpeakerPelosi tiene razón. Trump y los Republicanos deberían dejar de jugar a la política y apoyar TPS para los Venezolanos ya.
1187849257748967424 2019-10-25 14:51:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Speaker is right. Trump and Senate Republicans should stop playing politics and support TPS protection for vulnerable Venezuelans now.
1187841535754358790 2019-10-25 14:21:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> Called into the @CTUlocal1 picket line to thank them for all they do for our students. It’s time we give our educators and school staff the pay and dignity they deserve.
1187839499176304640 2019-10-25 14:13:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Employers are interfering with workers’ efforts to organize and negotiate for a fair contract— it's wrong.   My plan holds corporations and executives personally accountable for interfering with organizing efforts &amp; violating other labor laws. Learn more:  https://t.co/c4MyVM48db
1187829299207954437 2019-10-25 13:32:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are not prepared for a pandemic. Trump has rolled back progress President Obama and I made to strengthen global health security. We need leadership that builds public trust, focuses on real threats, and mobilizes the world to stop outbreaks before they reach our shores.
1187815339809112064 2019-10-25 12:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A job is about a lot more than a paycheck—it’s about dignity, it’s about respect, it’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything is going to be ok. Too many people today can’t say that.  We’ve got to rebuild the middle class and restore the dignity of work.  https://t.co/we89bXzESZ
1187803260280696833 2019-10-25 11:49:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, I’m releasing my plan to strengthen worker organizing, collective bargaining, and unions.  To grow a stronger, more inclusive middle class — I'll make it easier for workers to unionize. It's time we start rewarding work, not wealth. Read my plan:  https://t.co/c4MyVM48db.  https://t.co/urgRVPu8pE
1187796717187555331 2019-10-25 11:23:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congressman Elijah Cummings was a lion of democracy and a powerful ally in the fight for the soul of our nation. I am honored to have served alongside him and known him as a friend. May his passion and purpose live on as he rests in heavenly peace.
1187541788317405185 2019-10-24 18:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump’s abdication of American leadership on climate change is dangerous. If we give him four more years, our planet may never recover.  On day one, I’ll rejoin the Paris Agreement and rally the world to push our progress further and faster.  https://t.co/NTeEjxbYln
1187527946262732801 2019-10-24 17:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump lacks the moral authority to lead our country. Every day he spends in the White House, he further debases the values and ideals of our nation. We must make him a one-term president.
1187516873195302912 2019-10-24 16:51:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If I'm elected president, my children will not sit in on Cabinet meetings or have offices in the White House.  https://t.co/ouGpUpjyYJ
1187511588250517504 2019-10-24 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The powerful gun lobby has controlled our politics for far too long. Enough is enough. We the people own this country — not the @NRA.
1187499005606936576 2019-10-24 15:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden Administration. And just like everything else he’s inherited in his life — he’s in the process of squandering it.  https://t.co/wZFKqjb8r2
1187464528310652931 2019-10-24 13:23:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The United States of America can be defined by one word: Possibilities.  https://t.co/C9IKvhlHNk
1187441627385733122 2019-10-24 11:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm running for president to rebuild the backbone of our country—the middle class. And this time, we'll bring everyone along, so every American family can live a life of dignity.  If you’re with me, join the campaign by pitching in what you can today:  https://t.co/mqQ09RPYuI
1187432819791929345 2019-10-24 11:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> At a time when labor is under attack and Trump's reckless trade wars threaten millions more farms and families around the country, @TimRyan has been a clear voice for those at risk of being left behind. He'll continue to be a fierce force for them in Congress.
1187157253876572160 2019-10-23 17:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I strongly support the Senate's approval of North Macedonia's NATO membership. The countries of the Western Balkans deserve to be part of a Europe whole, free and at peace and we should be supporting Euro-Atlantic integration across the region.   https://t.co/UUyOWL20z7
1187148145651781632 2019-10-23 16:25:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I would press for dialogue to prevent further violence and instability. Investing in Haiti’s prosperity and security is in the national security interest of the United States.
1187148144703950849 2019-10-23 16:25:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Trump Administration is abandoning the Haitian people while the country’s political crisis is paralyzing that nation.  https://t.co/fdnCLnLQ0a
1187141902518411264 2019-10-23 16:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm proud to stand with @seiuhcpa and Regional Hospital of Scranton workers in their fight for higher wages, access to affordable health insurance, and a fair contract that invests in the future of their hospital.
1187105915280871424 2019-10-23 13:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hoy estamos lanzando Todos con Biden.

1187088353646333953 2019-10-23 12:28:13 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump has no idea what it means to be a part of the middle class. I do.  https://t.co/ewJ1ZKymG6
1187086789401559040 2019-10-23 12:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s be clear, this ban is dangerous and directly violates a woman's constitutional right to choose. We must stop it.   As president, I will codify Roe into federal law and ensure this choice remains between a woman and her doctor.  https://t.co/IFgnRjBm8N
1187067411960197120 2019-10-23 11:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Rooted in Scranton, fortified in the halls of Congress, and proven in the White House — my values have never changed, and they never will. I won’t stop fighting for the hardworking Americans who make our country run every single day.  https://t.co/wNRzK1iso1
1187050047181119488 2019-10-23 09:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let's get something straight — unions built the middle class.  https://t.co/Zfp1rJP8NY
1187033941238321152 2019-10-23 08:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We all want the same thing — a life of dignity and a fair shot at a better future.  Donald Trump isn't capable of understanding that.  https://t.co/XwojGzfmY2
1187010406406950914 2019-10-23 07:18:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> WATCH LIVE: Joe Biden Speaks in Scranton, Pennsylvania  https://t.co/yNWHciXiGS
1186995473112018946 2019-10-23 06:19:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> This morning, I’ll be in my hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, to discuss my plans to build a middle class where everyone comes along. Tune in at 10:00 AM ET to watch live:  https://t.co/miqSzSTQfF
1186989582182694922 2019-10-23 05:55:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> Once again, Putin and the Russians are interfering in the elections and trying to pick our president -- this time they're coming after me.  Chip in $5 to send the message to Putin that the American people decide elections, not him:  https://t.co/6ehaYAjgxA  https://t.co/o1GTKnizUY
1186830433985748993 2019-10-22 19:23:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> This wasn’t the right word to use and I’m sorry about that. Trump on the other hand chose his words deliberately today in his use of the word lynching and continues to stoke racial divides in this country daily.  https://t.co/mHfFC8HluZ
1186776746428907521 2019-10-22 15:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The moral obligation of our time is to restore, rebuild, and respect the backbone of America—the middle class. That mission will be my North Star as president.
1186745289106972673 2019-10-22 13:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our gun and domestic violence epidemics are linked — and we must take action to end them both. Leader McConnell should allow a vote on the House-passed VAWA reauthorization to close loopholes and keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals.  https://t.co/ZSPWyJAgjl
1186728427845406720 2019-10-22 12:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Campbell is an incredible young man, and I’m proud to have played a small part in his journey.  To anyone working to overcome a stutter, my message is clear: never give up and never let it define you. #ISAD  https://t.co/e7JRgVRV3a
1186707540748275713 2019-10-22 11:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There used to be a basic bargain in America—when your company did well, you shared in the prosperity. We must restore that bargain &amp; stand up to corporate profiteering.  I support @Teamsters25 as they strike against @RepublicService for a living wage, health care, and pensions.
1186691273870233601 2019-10-22 10:10:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> Impeachment is not "lynching," it is part of our Constitution. Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent. It's despicable.
1186668533591236609 2019-10-22 08:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Las armas de asalto y los cartuchos de alta capacidad no tienen lugar en nuestras comunidades. Yo me enfrente al @NRA una vez antes para prohibirlos, y lo volveré a hacer en la Casa Blanca.  https://t.co/e8TmUxKfej
1186439854630023168 2019-10-21 17:31:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are truly in a battle for the soul of our nation, and it’s up to all of us to stand up and reject intolerance in all its forms. We must give hate no safe harbor.
1186421004270297088 2019-10-21 16:16:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Russian Facebook trolls are back — and this time, they're going after my campaign. We cannot let 2016 repeat itself.  Chip in $5 to our rapid response fund to help us fight back against their lies and foreign interference in our elections:  https://t.co/6ehaYAjgxA
1186410583647752192 2019-10-21 15:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump talks tough on trade but has nothing to show for it—other than pain for America's families. Mike Pence has been his complicit sidekick, propping up Trump’s reckless trade wars and slighting hard-working Americans across the country.  https://t.co/DPQRNCeA0A
1186352702420344832 2019-10-21 11:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines have no place in our communities. I’ve taken on the @NRA to ban them once before, and I’ll do it again in the White House.  https://t.co/e8TmUxKfej
1186326530206633984 2019-10-21 10:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> After the most corrupt administration in modern history, the next president faces a big task: restoring faith in American government. A Biden administration will ensure our government works for all Americans — not just the powerful.  https://t.co/Jy1UKwH7jd
1186292304295809027 2019-10-21 07:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the United States, health care should be a right for all — not a privilege for the few. As president, I will give Americans a new choice — a Medicare-like public option — to ensure everyone has access to the quality, affordable care they need.  https://t.co/gm6jgUrcaT
1186076633100406784 2019-10-20 17:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump has asked three foreign governments to interfere in our elections on his behalf. In full view of the American people, he has violated his oath of office and betrayed our nation.  He must be impeached.
1186064553563394049 2019-10-20 16:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Four years of Betsy DeVos is more than enough. We’re going to make sure the next Secretary of Education is a teacher.  https://t.co/6Bn4k3ATDl
1186034857706606592 2019-10-20 14:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m not going to be distracted by all of President Trump's lies, smears, distortions, and name-calling. I’m going to stay focused on the issues that matter to you—because action cannot wait when it comes to health care, or jobs, or education, or guns, or climate.
1185980499753406464 2019-10-20 11:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thoughts and prayers won’t end our gun violence epidemic.   It’s past time we take on the @NRA and pass common-sense gun safety reform — that starts with banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and requiring universal background checks.
1185710218828603392 2019-10-19 17:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hosting the G7 at Trump’s hotel? A president should never be able to use the office for personal gain.
1185688827622379520 2019-10-19 15:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s be clear — the effects of climate change are devastating. We need to take action.   As president, I’ll not only address this grave threat— I’ll lead the rest of the world in addressing the climate emergency. Read my plan at  https://t.co/FbsOsz7VzW.  https://t.co/llaQztOW1p
1185664668414529536 2019-10-19 14:11:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our firefighters and teachers should not be paying a higher tax rate than the super-wealthy. We’ve got to rebuild the middle class and, this time, make sure everyone comes along.
1185634972935344129 2019-10-19 12:13:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> These moments, getting to speak with all of you...that's what keeps me going. We need a leader who cares. That's why I'm running for President.  https://t.co/Y5jRFMp2hX
1185613330272010241 2019-10-19 10:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump has relentlessly fought to sabotage and repeal Obamacare — I will not stand for it.   I will protect and build on Obamacare as president, ensuring every American has peace of mind when it comes to their health care.  https://t.co/6khWa6SI78
1185597401727459333 2019-10-19 09:43:42 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is what being bought and paid for by the @NRA looks like. It’s cowardly.
1185371953869271042 2019-10-18 18:47:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump withheld Congressionally appropriated aid to Ukraine unless they granted him a political favor. It's the definition of quid pro quo.  This is no joke—Trump continues to put his own personal, political interests ahead of the national interest. He must be impeached.
1185352159069642752 2019-10-18 17:29:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’ve got to choose truth over lies — and that starts with getting Donald Trump out of the White House.
1185337261409427463 2019-10-18 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 15 years ago, I worked to help pass the North Korea Human Rights Act. We made our values clear to the brutal regime in Pyongyang. Trump has instead made excuses for the dictator in the North and refuses to appoint a special envoy for human rights in NK. It is disgraceful.
1185325383471620096 2019-10-18 15:42:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@realDonaldTrump, we have a message for you: release your tax returns or shut up about corruption.  Get yours today:
1185315115400253440 2019-10-18 15:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It is not just that Donald Trump is a liar. It is not just that he is corrupt. It is that every day he finds new ways to lie in an attempt to cover up his own corruption.  https://t.co/FVh70mc8kh
1185303941598339077 2019-10-18 14:17:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump está restableciendo fondos "específicos" a Centroamérica. Yo apoyo la restauración de financiación total para abordar las causas de la crisis migratoria, incluyendo ayuda para el desarrollo, el cual reduce violencia/migración. Políticas coercitivas en sí no son suficientes.
1185300147825188864 2019-10-18 14:02:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congratulations for making history, @Astro_Christina and @Astro_Jessica. Because of you, every girl knows that even the stars are not beyond her reach. #AllWomanSpaceWalk
1185257233942229004 2019-10-18 11:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> From day one, a Biden administration will be focused on rebuilding the backbone of our country — the middle class. And this time, we’ll make sure everyone comes along — regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.
1185239618574151681 2019-10-18 10:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Venezuela’s election to the UN Human Rights Council is a travesty. Nicolás Maduro is a dictator, plain and simple. His regime’s human rights violations and extrajudicial killings have been documented by the UNHRC.  https://t.co/n9DnSl5PfA
1185223198121627648 2019-10-18 08:56:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump is only reinstating “targeted” funds to Central America. I support full restoration of bipartisan funding to address root causes of the migration crisis—including the development aid proven to reduce violence and migration. Law enforcement alone is not enough.
1185212690714652673 2019-10-18 08:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Eliminate all private dollars from federal elections.  Overturn Citizens United and end dark money groups.  Ban lobbyists from donating to candidates they lobby.  It's time we ensure our government works for the people — not just the powerful.
1185005072352239624 2019-10-17 18:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When leaders like Admiral McRaven speak, we should listen. Donald Trump is a threat to our national security — his erratic, impulsive decisions make us all less safe. We cannot give him eight years in the White House.  https://t.co/DjAa3seQqf
1184981164785692672 2019-10-17 16:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the most reckless and incompetent Commander-in-Chief we’ve ever had.
1184966065220128768 2019-10-17 15:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every young person deserves to be affirmed and accepted exactly as they are — regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Today on #SpiritDay and every day, we must ensure LGBTQ youth hear that message loud and clear.
1184958515460411398 2019-10-17 15:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Proud to stand with @CTULocal1, @SEIU73, and every teacher and support staff member striking today for better staffing and quality schools for our students. It's time we support all workers with the pay and dignity they deserve. #FairContractNow
1184953482601779200 2019-10-17 15:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, we’re officially launching our fall line! Head to  https://t.co/CQm11tCOcn to stock up on new t-shirts, stickers, sweatshirts, and more.  https://t.co/OT8NGnGuoj
1184895256938065921 2019-10-17 11:13:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hosting a major foreign leader summit at a Trump hotel? Donald Trump continues to abuse his power to line his own pockets. Time to put up (your tax returns) or shut up Mr. President.
1184882263403782144 2019-10-17 10:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> From banning assault weapons to passing Obamacare — I know what it takes to pass important, consequential legislation. I'm the only person in this race with the proven ability to get the job done.  https://t.co/afK3fdTQxp
1184827750156242945 2019-10-17 06:45:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> Elijah Cummings was a true public servant, his life defined by the love of his community and a fierce commitment to ensuring truth wins over power. The whole Biden family sends our condolences to his wife, Maya, his children, and the entire city of Baltimore.  https://t.co/jYbvQwZI1a
1184650737630011393 2019-10-16 19:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Kurds were integral in helping us defeat ISIS — and too many lost their lives. Now, President Trump has abandoned them. It's shameful.
1184622551940636673 2019-10-16 17:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Diplomacy isn’t just a series of handshakes and photo ops. But Donald Trump doesn't understand that — and he never will.  https://t.co/ku67EeNg7v
1184607452248936449 2019-10-16 16:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The next president will face an enormous challenge of picking up the pieces of America’s foreign policy, salvaging our reputation, and rebuilding respect for the United States around the world.  We need a leader who will be ready on day one.  https://t.co/dUqxxmzuoe
1184595624441929728 2019-10-16 15:23:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump — what a delusional man.  https://t.co/kJAn9SewcW
1184577681624633344 2019-10-16 14:11:42 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m about to take the stage in Iowa to discuss Donald Trump’s reckless actions in Syria. Tune in now to watch live:  https://t.co/hnj0gIF0D1
1184565057352536064 2019-10-16 13:21:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> This afternoon, I'll be discussing Donald Trump's recent actions in Syria and how his erratic, impulsive decisions endanger our troops and make us all less safe. Tune in at 5PM ET to watch live:   https://t.co/6hXwCuCLsr
1184560895768137729 2019-10-16 13:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Unlike President Trump, I know what it takes to negotiate with Erdoğan. And if I were president, I would make him pay a heavy price for what he has done.  https://t.co/vv4P1q7B5S
1184545796349411328 2019-10-16 12:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The events of this past week in Syria have made clear just how dangerous Donald Trump is to our national security, to our leadership around the world, and to the lives of our brave men and women serving in uniform.  https://t.co/jnV8LxZ5vT
1184524243956097025 2019-10-16 10:39:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@realDonaldTrump, you want to talk about corruption? I’ve released 21 years of my tax returns — release yours or shut up.  https://t.co/5JFDINCSeQ
1184336164553216000 2019-10-15 22:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I won't need any on-the-job training. I'll be ready on day one. #DemDebate  https://t.co/LxNzmyI6yW
1184333537698291712 2019-10-15 22:01:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m relying on your support to power my campaign. Together, I know we can defeat Donald Trump and protect our democracy. Just $5 can make a difference. Chip in today:  https://t.co/Onuzp7zq47  https://t.co/1HciZmllWD
1184318490850856961 2019-10-15 21:01:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's time we pick our heads up and remember who we are. This is the United States of America — there is not a single thing we cannot do if we do it together.  https://t.co/Ft8Hswz212
1184309045294960641 2019-10-15 20:24:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> I just stepped off the #DemDebate stage, where I laid out my bold vision for the country and how I’ll deliver real progress for working families.  If you liked what you heard tonight, help us keep our momentum going by pitching in:  https://t.co/s5nd6p8r7o
1184308415948115968 2019-10-15 20:21:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have an erratic, crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear for his own re-election. #DemDebate  https://t.co/t7vkrWX0CC
1184306245584543747 2019-10-15 20:13:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> That’s all we have for tonight’s #DemDebate! Make sure to follow @TeamJoe to stay up-to-date on everything happening on our campaign.  https://t.co/tidV9ZfqT2
1184299888030474240 2019-10-15 19:47:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe Biden is the only candidate on the #DemDebate stage who has actually beaten the @NRA — and he did it twice.  As president, he will ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines once again. #DemDebate  https://t.co/5i5GcRJDr7
1184296664753983488 2019-10-15 19:35:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s put this in perspective: if you eliminate every single solitary soldier, tank, satellite, nuclear weapon, eliminate the Pentagon and it would only pay for 4 months of Medicare for All. 4 months.  Where do the other 8 months come from? Your paycheck. #DemDebate
1184294114319327233 2019-10-15 19:24:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. Period.   As president, Joe Biden will stand up to attacks on a woman’s constitutional right to choose and enshrine Roe into federal law. #DemDebate
1184291808110694400 2019-10-15 19:15:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> Medicare for All will cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years — and it will be paid for in part by raising taxes on middle class families.  Joe Biden has a better plan — he will protect and build on Obamacare to ensure everyone has access to quality, affordable health care.  https://t.co/Yg5auxKojQ
1184283057425133569 2019-10-15 18:40:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe Biden has a bold plan to end our gun violence epidemic. But it’s going to take more than plans—it’s going to take leadership and a proven ability to get things done.  He's banned assault weapons and high-capacity magazines before &amp; he'll do it again.  https://t.co/AbTUKdY7Bv  https://t.co/cHd98KZqLx
1184278950698201088 2019-10-15 18:24:39 -0800 <JoeBiden> “We have an erratic, crazy President who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy.”  #DemDebate
1184277161508851712 2019-10-15 18:17:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> Three — that's how many times President Trump asked foreign governments to interfere in our political process.  Why? Because he's scared. He knows Joe Biden will beat him like a drum. #DemDebate  https://t.co/ddRoalUIdt
1184275781943476224 2019-10-15 18:12:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> The United States has a vital national interest in Syria to ensure the lasting defeat of ISIS. We know that this terrorist group plotted to attack our homeland in the past, and we cannot let that threat re-emerge. #DemDebate
1184275485456588802 2019-10-15 18:10:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump betrayed our partners in the Syrian Democratic Forces and put at risk our gains against ISIS. This is a disaster of his own making. #DemDebate
1184273842925195269 2019-10-15 18:04:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, Joe Biden will repeal Trump’s tax cuts for corporations and the super-wealthy, and build a tax code that rewards work, not just wealth. #DemDebate
1184270938080206850 2019-10-15 17:52:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our firefighters and teachers work tirelessly to make our communities safer, better places to live. They should not pay a higher tax rate than the super-wealthy. #DemDebate
1184270737156313088 2019-10-15 17:52:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> On day one, Joe Biden will move to:  ✅ Eliminate the Trump tax cut for the super-wealthy ✅ Eliminate the unjustified loopholes in our tax code ✅ Use that money to invest in America’s future  #DemDebate
1184268060632502272 2019-10-15 17:41:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history. He must be impeached. #DemDebate  https://t.co/2MJI33u28D
1184266561168838662 2019-10-15 17:35:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t beat Donald Trump with double talk on health care.  Joe Biden doesn’t just know what his health care plan is—he knows how much it would cost, and how he would pay for it. #DemDebate  https://t.co/2EnBmoFTft
1184263647889121280 2019-10-15 17:23:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> Medicare for All will cost *checks notes* 30x more than Joe Biden's plan to protect and build on Obamacare — and it will be paid for in part by raising taxes on middle class families. #DemDebate  https://t.co/ICr2E7wFJ8
1184262429120835585 2019-10-15 17:19:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> “Russia, if you’re listening…”  “I would like you to do us a favor…” to Ukraine’s president  “China should start an investigation.”  Our President has asked three foreign powers to intervene in our elections on his behalf — and those are just the ones we know about! #DemDebate
1184259445909573633 2019-10-15 17:07:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> A president who puts his own self-interest ahead of the public good and national security poses a threat to each and every American in our daily lives.  Donald Trump should be impeached. Period. #DemDebate  https://t.co/eY2DAPne5d
1184258208514396160 2019-10-15 17:02:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hey everyone — @TeamJoe here! We’re taking over the account to keep you in the loop on tonight’s #DemDebate. Make sure to follow along for updates!  https://t.co/RkPKbgDexW
1184251765522341889 2019-10-15 16:36:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, we have to do more than beat Donald Trump.  We have to beat him like a drum.  When I take the #DemDebate stage tonight, I'm going to show you that I'm the best candidate to do just that.  Let's go.
1184251764884885505 2019-10-15 16:36:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> From the Voting Rights Act renewal, to the ban on assault weapons, to the Violence Against Women Act, to Obamacare, to the Recovery Act that kept us from sliding into a Depression, I’ve delivered progress for you.  I know what it takes to get it done.
1184251763928502272 2019-10-15 16:36:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> Fixing what's broken in this country will take vision—and yes, it will take plans. But that’s not enough.  It also takes the proven ability to get it done. And there is no one on tonight's stage who has a stronger record of passing important, consequential legislation than I do.
1184251763328729090 2019-10-15 16:36:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> This election is about you. Your children. Your family. And you can’t wait for a president fighting for you when it comes to health care, or jobs, or education, or guns, or climate. The world can’t wait for America to once again lead a stable, peaceful international order.
1184251762393436161 2019-10-15 16:36:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> For days, pundits have let Donald Trump define the conversation around tonight's #DemDebate.  Well, Trump doesn't get to pick the Democratic nominee. And I’m not going to be distracted by all his lies, smears, distortions, and name-calling. He’s picked a fight with the wrong guy.
1184242799710859264 2019-10-15 16:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Philadelphia's office cleaners work hard every day to keep the city's buildings clean. They deserve the dignity that comes with a living wage, access to health care, and a secure retirement. I stand with @32BJSEIU cleaners in their fight for a fair contract. #BuildingJustice
1184206057649909762 2019-10-15 13:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Overturning Citizens United isn’t enough. Ridding our politics of big money and corporate special interests demands more. We must go further.  I will introduce a constitutional amendment to get all private dollars out of our federal elections.
1184180892023087104 2019-10-15 11:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump is leading the most corrupt administration in modern American history. It’s got to end.  We must restore integrity to our government and ensure our elected officials work for all Americans — not just the powerful.  https://t.co/81eLH8nrvX
1183912875552722944 2019-10-14 18:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history.
1183899034336940032 2019-10-14 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The news from Fort Worth is heartbreaking. Atatiana Jefferson should still be alive today. We cannot allow this to keep happening, we must reform our policing practices and hold officers accountable for their actions.  https://t.co/f18kAHbFWH
1183891484858179584 2019-10-14 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the definition of corruption. At every turn, he has abused the power of the presidency to benefit his bottom line and weaponized the Executive Branch to serve himself.  I’ll ensure our government works for the people—not just Donald Trump.  https://t.co/oZnl5qySmw
1183876385087119363 2019-10-14 15:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Overturning Citizens United is an important step in ending the corrupting influence of money in our politics, but we must go further.  As president, I will introduce a constitutional amendment to eliminate all private dollars from our federal elections.  https://t.co/iGrbvPEsKf  https://t.co/7BASgRd0EN
1183842159658582017 2019-10-14 13:29:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America was built on a simple proposition: we're all created equal. We haven't yet fully lived up to that ideal, but we've never stopped trying.  Transgender folks deserve every right afforded to Americans — and as president, I will fight to secure those rights.  https://t.co/LvcqOZOxWq
1183821020530130946 2019-10-14 12:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On #IndigenousPeoplesDay, we recognize the resiliency of indigenous communities and celebrate their rich contributions to society—while recommitting to the work that remains to come to terms with our past as a nation, to honor our promises, and work to right our wrongs.
1183792582964346883 2019-10-14 10:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our Constitution begins with three simple words, “We the People” — not “We the Donors.” But for too long, corporations and special interests have corrupted our political process and rigged it in their favor.  Today, I’m releasing my plan to change that:  https://t.co/iGrbvPmRlF
1183575401966125059 2019-10-13 19:49:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Corporations should not value their profits over the health and safety of their employees. As president, I will significantly increase the number of inspectors within the pork and beef industries to ensure every individual has safe working conditions.  https://t.co/5KrOfy2ldD
1183554274002911232 2019-10-13 18:25:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump betrayed our partners, the Syrian Democratic Forces, and endangered our hard-won gains against ISIS. Our troops are left in the middle of a war with no plan other than retreat.  He has failed as Commander-in-Chief to safeguard our country &amp; protect our troops.
1183525825251020800 2019-10-13 16:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is a threat to our democracy. He must be impeached.
1183513242280366080 2019-10-13 15:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It is wonderful to see Sesame Street raising awareness about the effect of substance use disorder on families. We need to be doing more to help parents experiencing addiction and support children who end up in foster care because of this issue.  https://t.co/SItckU6oWk
1183506950857863173 2019-10-13 15:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Affordable Care Act has been under relentless attack for the past nine years — I will not stand for it. As president, I will protect and build on the ACA to ensure every American has peace of mind when it comes to their health care.  https://t.co/uw7Kk16p6a
1183487825016213506 2019-10-13 14:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you, @UFCW! I promise you won’t have a better ally in the White House if I’m president. I’m a union guy and always have been. Together, we can restore the soul of this nation.  https://t.co/Cmutbywwth
1183465897446563845 2019-10-13 12:33:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m about to take the stage at the @UFCW Presidential Forum in Iowa, where I’ll discuss my plans to strengthen America’s unions. Tune in to watch live:  https://t.co/0Ail0AXGgA
1183432316426829825 2019-10-13 10:20:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> The devastating effects of gun violence don’t end when the shooting is over—survivors may face mental health and substance use disorders in the months and years that follow.  Enough is enough. We must end this epidemic.  https://t.co/RPDUEeRTyd
1183173893055533058 2019-10-12 17:13:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> @SarahEMcBride @MaraKeisling @NCTEActionFund Thanks Sarah. I'm proud of you and so is Beau.
1183170484269174784 2019-10-12 17:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A good education should be a reliable pathway to the middle class—not saddle you with mountains of debt. My new plan will provide two years of community college without debt, double Pell grants, invest $50 billion in workforce training programs, and more.  https://t.co/lU9sfUkPUG
1183155384158052352 2019-10-12 16:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Immigrants have always made us stronger as a nation — our diversity has always been our greatest strength. Donald Trump doesn’t get that.  https://t.co/DjftXcvs09
1183136509785821184 2019-10-12 14:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump's attacks on Congresswoman Omar and Somali refugees have no place in our nation — let alone the White House.  A president should unite us around our shared goals and lift us up, not stoke the flames of hatred and tear us down.  https://t.co/WpWikGYt4b
1183116097450663939 2019-10-12 13:23:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> I was proud to work with Matthew’s parents, Judy and Dennis, to extend our hate crimes law to cover sexual orientation and gender identity. But there’s still more work to be done — we can’t rest until every single American can live open and proud without fear.
1183116096896937984 2019-10-12 13:23:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> 21 years ago, Matthew Shepard passed away after a brutal anti-gay hate crime — an attack that shook the conscience of our nation. As we honor his memory, we must remember that members of the LGBTQ community — especially trans women of color — are still targeted with violence.
1183079887134957569 2019-10-12 11:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump believes he can and will get away with anything he does. We all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it.  Now, he is shooting holes in our Constitution. We cannot let him get away with it.
1183052204481171461 2019-10-12 09:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We believe Americans should decide American elections. But Trump will do anything to get re-elected, including violating the most basic norms of our democracy. It's dangerous.  We cannot give him four more years in the White House.
1182789222505308162 2019-10-11 15:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our planet is at a critical moment — and if we re-elect Donald Trump, it may never recover.  On day one, I’ll take action to reverse the damage done by this administration and put America on track to lead the world in addressing the climate emergency.  https://t.co/LP25Ii1xA2
1182747194572460032 2019-10-11 12:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me make something clear to President Trump: I’m not going anywhere.  You’re not going to destroy me. And you’re not going to destroy my family. I don’t care how dirty the attacks get.
1182732850237304833 2019-10-11 12:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Living open and proud is a daily act of bravery — bravery that resides in the heart of every single LGBTQ individual.  To those who have come out and to those who haven’t, know that I’m proud of you. You are loved and you are accepted just as you are. #ComingOutDay
1182709950096777216 2019-10-11 10:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today is a reminder to every girl on the planet: nothing is beyond your capacity or capability. And all of us must work to ensure that girls around the world have the chance to participate fully in society and that their rights are respected. #DayoftheGirl
1182699419696799747 2019-10-11 09:48:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> To LGBTQ people suffering persecution anywhere: the American people are on your side. And as president, I will ensure the U.S. leads the world to defend human rights for all.
1182699418698559488 2019-10-11 09:48:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> LGBTQ rights are human rights. Uganda's proposed new law is inhumane. Using religion or culture to license discrimination is never justifiable. Period.  https://t.co/m54xkTraqm
1182688558672498689 2019-10-11 09:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Using religion or culture to discriminate against or demonize LGBTQ individuals is never justified—not anywhere in the world.  I will send a clear message from the top of our government: prejudice is prejudice, inhumanity is inhumanity, and the U.S. will not stand for it.  https://t.co/HUMcFVSSfA
1182504092817444865 2019-10-10 20:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I spent my night at the HRC forum talking about the fundamental respect every human being deserves. You spent yours showing how little respect for anyone else you have. America is so much stronger than your weakness, @realDonaldTrump.
1182501072734183426 2019-10-10 20:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Honored to be asked a question at tonight's #EqualityTownHall by my friend Judy Shepard. It was a privilege to work with her to secure the passage of legislation that extended our hate crimes laws to crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
1182473893841260544 2019-10-10 18:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to make sure that no hospital or health care provider can discriminate against someone simply because of who they are or whom they love. #EqualityTownHall  https://t.co/bVgmfgSA06
1182457032638631936 2019-10-10 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There is no distinction between mental health and physical health — it’s health. Period. We've got to combat the stigma and ensure everyone has access to the care they need and deserve. #WorldMentalHealthDay
1182442688030937089 2019-10-10 16:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Looking forward to joining @AndersonCooper at tonight’s #EqualityTownHall to discuss the work that remains in the fight for LGBTQ rights. Tune in to CNN at 8PM ET to watch live.
1182440674806788098 2019-10-10 16:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> For all the hard-won progress we've made in the fight for LGBTQ equality, we're not done — not nearly.  We must stand up to President Trump's dangerous attacks on the rights of the LGBTQ community and continue to fight for full equality.  https://t.co/Wtxpczcawj
1182435138300530688 2019-10-10 16:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Americans should decide American elections. Period.  https://t.co/oc5HavIiuf
1182374992274579457 2019-10-10 12:19:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I sat down with @MaraKeisling of the @NCTEActionFund to discuss the progress we’ve made on LGBTQ rights and the work that remains. Transgender equality is the civil rights issue of our time—I won’t stop fighting until everyone is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.  https://t.co/zaLAdKWBrV
1182351336299302912 2019-10-10 10:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump picked a fight with the wrong guy.  https://t.co/5s7izCLSzt
1182340904780218368 2019-10-10 10:03:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump made this decision on a whim, after a phone call with Turkish President Erdogan. There was no process. No consultation with our military, our diplomats, or our allies. Trump got rolled, plain and simple, because he has no idea what he's doing.
1182340903261868033 2019-10-10 10:03:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> But that's not all — he betrayed our brave troops, who sacrificed alongside them. He betrayed our word as a nation — raising doubts among our allies around the world about America's security commitments.
1182340902129487877 2019-10-10 10:03:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump sold out the Syrian Democratic Forces — the courageous Kurds and Arabs who fought with us to smash ISIS's caliphate — and he betrayed a key local ally in the fight against terrorism.  https://t.co/VWJDpISjy2
1182304779692691456 2019-10-10 07:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In full view of the American people, Donald Trump has violated his oath of office and betrayed this nation. He must be impeached.  https://t.co/ivRAqnHHZb
1182103452790509573 2019-10-09 18:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump has decided that we don't have the power or the political will to hold him accountable. He's not just testing us — he's laughing at us.  We must prove him wrong. He must be impeached.  https://t.co/4ahsVPiqxX
1182073253889622018 2019-10-09 16:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Like every bully, President Trump is lashing out because he’s afraid. He’s afraid of how badly I will beat him next November.  Let’s make his worst fear a reality:  https://t.co/a9zec0IrRf  https://t.co/kjrK3mzzjk
1182044180245352450 2019-10-09 14:24:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> Only a little farther north, Timothy Ragland won his race to become both the youngest and first African American mayor of Talladega. I'm confident they will serve the people of Alabama well.
1182044179192598528 2019-10-09 14:24:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> Last night, history was made in the birthplace of the civil rights movement, when Steven Reed became the first African American mayor of Montgomery.
1182041117640003584 2019-10-09 14:12:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump sees no limit to his power. He believes he can — and will — get away with anything he does.  https://t.co/wxCjXIubfM
1182028458735497216 2019-10-09 13:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, and our basic integrity — Donald Trump should be impeached.  https://t.co/fa14AGZdW9
1182019902204334080 2019-10-09 12:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Two days ago, Trump impulsively gave Turkey a green light to invade Syria, blindsiding our military. Today, we see the consequences—Turkish forces attacking the fighters that helped us take on ISIS. It’s a betrayal, takes pressure off the terrorist threat, &amp; leaves us less safe.
1182005917602201600 2019-10-09 11:52:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day Donald Trump is in the White House, he poses a grave threat to our democracy. We must make him a one-term president.  Help us defeat him by pitching in to our Beat Trump Fund before midnight:  https://t.co/wNHtfGmXsv
1181999504498843648 2019-10-09 11:26:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> With his words and with his actions, President Trump has indicted himself.  He should be impeached.
1181997336052080647 2019-10-09 11:18:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thanks for watching. Stop stonewalling the Congress. Honor your oath. Respect the Constitution.  And speaking of taxpayers, I’ve released 21 years of my tax returns. You?
1181984733162590215 2019-10-09 10:28:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> Join me now as I take the stage:  https://t.co/xQ62JANeIt
1181979945599455232 2019-10-09 10:09:13 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m about to take the stage in New Hampshire to discuss the grave threat Donald Trump poses to our democracy and the action we must take. Tune in now:  https://t.co/PNjixxCxrn
1181970371878277121 2019-10-09 09:31:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> This afternoon, I’ll be speaking about President Trump’s abuse of power and the grave threat he poses to our democracy. Tune in at 12:45 PM ET to watch live.  https://t.co/PNjixxCxrn
1181738548426416130 2019-10-08 18:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I send our best wishes to those taking part in the Hindu festival of Navratri. As the nine days of celebration come to a close, let us remain optimistic of the triumph of good over evil and the opportunity of new beginnings.
1181724707072040960 2019-10-08 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I have spent my entire career fighting the abuse of power.  Donald Trump has spent his entire career abusing his power.
1181712124197736448 2019-10-08 16:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In public and in private, President Trump has asked foreign governments to interfere in our elections on his behalf. It is an abuse of power. We cannot let him get away with it.  Chip in to our Trump Rapid Response Fund to help us respond:  https://t.co/1mJbMuzbH0  https://t.co/vPYBDxo3Nz
1181673117225115648 2019-10-08 13:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I wish Jewish communities around the world an easy fast as they gather to observe Yom Kippur. The Day of Atonement is an important reminder of the obligation we all share to reflect on our actions and recommit to our values in the year ahead. L’Shana Tovah.
1181638272419803136 2019-10-08 11:31:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump must stop stonewalling Congress and fully cooperate with the investigations. The American people deserve the truth.
1181625805513773057 2019-10-08 10:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No one should live in fear of being fired because of who they are or whom they love. We must stand up to President Trump’s relentless attacks on LGBTQ rights and continue the fight for full equality—because every American deserves to live open, proud, and free. #RiseUpOct8
1181612507397537792 2019-10-08 09:49:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> We will make historic investments in education and training to ensure every American has a reliable path to the middle class—regardless of their parents’ income or the color of their skin.  Wondering how the plan will benefit you? Take the quiz:  https://t.co/ba2juUMDUk  https://t.co/eBrukAxvzw
1181612506726506497 2019-10-08 09:49:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions play a vital role in our communities. A Biden administration will invest $70 billion in these institutions to improve affordability, build high tech labs and facilities, and support student success.
1181612505996627970 2019-10-08 09:49:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> A Biden administration will take concrete action to address the student debt crisis in our country. We will expand access to Pell Grants, more than halve income-based payments on undergraduate federal student loans, and make student loan forgiveness work for public servants.
1181612505115873280 2019-10-08 09:49:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@DrBiden calls community colleges America’s best kept secret — she's right. A Biden administration will invest in these institutions, providing every American with two years of community college or other high-quality training programs without debt.
1181612504365092864 2019-10-08 09:49:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> A good education should be a reliable pathway to the middle class. But for too many, earning a credential or degree after high school comes with a mountain of debt or is out of reach altogether.  Today, I’m releasing my plan to change that:  https://t.co/lU9sfUkPUG
1181362319193976833 2019-10-07 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Firefighters and teachers should not pay a higher tax rate than the wealthiest in our country. As president, I will reverse President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy and create a tax code that works for the middle class.  It’s time we reward work, not just wealth.
1181336650602950657 2019-10-07 15:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Abuse of power is the defining characteristic of the Trump presidency.  Donald Trump has abused the foreign policy of the United States to extract personal, political favors from multiple countries.  We must stop him.  https://t.co/5IojhccVq3
1181322054181761024 2019-10-07 14:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, I'm proud the campaign is launching Women for Biden. There's so much at stake in this election — and so much more work to do in the fight for women's health care, paychecks, safety, and families:  https://t.co/ZYn4CXKuc1  https://t.co/54v5rS7XLD
1181291857134919682 2019-10-07 12:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I will make passing the Equality Act a top legislative priority. A Biden administration won’t rest until we truly achieve full equality, and everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law.
1181291856480604160 2019-10-07 12:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A president should use the full might of the executive branch to secure justice, dignity, and safety for all. Instead, President Trump does the opposite — callously exerting his power over the most vulnerable.  We must send a clear message: We will not stand for this.
1181291855780237314 2019-10-07 12:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This week, the Trump Administration is set to argue before the Supreme Court that it’s legal to discriminate against someone simply because of who they are or whom they love. It’s a dangerous attack on the civil rights of LGBTQ Americans and everything we stand for.
1181263417765548032 2019-10-07 10:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We cannot, and will not, stand for President Trump’s corruption. We will beat him like a drum.
1180965202482778112 2019-10-06 14:57:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we stand together we can, and will, end our gun violence epidemic. Read my full plan to address this public health epidemic at  https://t.co/AbTUKdGwcV.  https://t.co/SjcCZfVbK7
1180946076590886912 2019-10-06 13:41:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump continuously dishonors everything it means to hold the office of President of the United States of America. We must make him a one-term president.
1180935003699580932 2019-10-06 12:57:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Elena @De11eDonne is the pride of Delaware. Wishing her well as she recovers — we need more professional athletes like her sharing their support for inclusive sports. I'm looking forward to seeing her back on the court soon.
1180917857242234883 2019-10-06 11:48:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> In my experience, asking a foreign government to manufacture lies about your domestic political opponent is not “done all the time.”
1180914870805352448 2019-10-06 11:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No family should be struggling to make ends meet. American farmers are hurting as a result of President Trump’s broken promises — his trade war is reckless.    As president, I’ll stand up to China and pursue a trade policy that prioritizes American workers. https://t.co/r2xsaneMlf
1180903546407010304 2019-10-06 10:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our planet just experienced the hottest September on record — yet President Trump continues to dismiss the devastating effects of climate change. As president, I’ll address this grave threat and lead the world in addressing our climate emergency.  https://t.co/btVh7yDdgD
1180887681913499648 2019-10-06 09:48:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's clear who President Trump works for. He gave giant tax cuts to the super-wealthy and corporations. Now, he’s cutting food stamp funding for the 3rd time. It’s cruel.  No family should go hungry in America.
1180879135670857730 2019-10-06 09:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I are devastated to hear about last night’s shooting in Kansas City. No one should ever have to fear that they, or their loved ones, may not return home due to senseless violence.  We must come together as a country to put an end to these tragedies once and for all.
1180658582125080581 2019-10-05 18:38:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day it becomes clearer, we cannot give Donald Trump four more years in the White House. Stand with me, and together we can make him a one-term president:  https://t.co/BKuXG8A15i
1180654653127692288 2019-10-05 18:22:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> And to Trump and those who facilitate his abuses of power, and all the special interests funding his attacks against me: Please know that I’m not going anywhere. You won’t destroy me, and you won’t destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.
1180654515302883329 2019-10-05 18:22:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> While the House does its job on impeachment, I’m going to stay focused on what matters: improving the lives of Americans and fighting to ensure that the United States is once again the leader of the free world.
1180654090600226817 2019-10-05 18:20:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s the same cynical playbook he returns to again and again. But this time it won’t work, because the American people know me—and they know him. I will put the integrity of my whole career in public service to this nation up against Trump’s lack of integrity any day of the week.
1180653952347574273 2019-10-05 18:20:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our first president, George Washington, famously could not tell a lie. Trump seemingly cannot tell the truth — about anything. He slanders anyone he sees as a threat. It's why is he is frantically pushing flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears against me.
1180653812081659906 2019-10-05 18:19:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> He does not understand the immense responsibility demanded of all those who hold the office of the president of the United States. He sees only the power – and how it can benefit just one person: Donald Trump.
1180653646142476288 2019-10-05 18:18:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day, more evidence is uncovered revealing that Trump is abusing the power of the presidency and is wholly unfit to be president. He is using the highest office in the land to advance his personal, political interests instead of the national interest.  https://t.co/NNpDITpwBV
1180629993774338052 2019-10-05 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Obamacare was, and is, a big deal. It covered 20 million additional Americans, protects over 100 million with pre-existing conditions, and has saved lives.  We can’t afford to tear it down and start over. As president, I will protect and build on it.  https://t.co/Wm7cm9sMEi
1180612126131527680 2019-10-05 15:34:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump is spending millions of dollars attacking me because he's scared I'll beat him.  But I’m not going anywhere. I won’t let Donald Trump choose the Democratic nominee.  https://t.co/k2YNjnlfEU
1180588471091695616 2019-10-05 14:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern history.  https://t.co/EjfAKdivy7
1180570854251548672 2019-10-05 12:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If there are any angels in heaven, they are all male and female nurses.  https://t.co/ImQGL8r04B
1180549224485838848 2019-10-05 11:24:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have a president who believes he is above the law and that there is no limit to his power.  He is wrong. We cannot let him get away with this.  Chip in to help us beat him like a drum:  https://t.co/d6wGkKd85B
1180519264257753088 2019-10-05 09:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the definition of corruption.
1180506681459040256 2019-10-05 08:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, and we must fight any and all attempts to overturn it. As president, I will codify Roe into law and ensure this choice remains between a woman and her doctor.  https://t.co/kaJbYWcYhL
1180273897301655552 2019-10-04 17:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Health care is personal to me like it is for so many Americans. I promise you, as president, I will protect your family's health care as I would my own.  https://t.co/BTS5MW1J7J
1180232373880922120 2019-10-04 14:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It has been 219 days since the House passed the bipartisan universal background check bill. Every day since, @senatemajldr McConnell has refused to bring it up for a vote.  Enough. How many more Americans must die for Senate Republicans to stand up to the @NRA and take action?
1180211734818279427 2019-10-04 13:02:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> Looking forward to joining @SEIU at the #UnionsForAll Summit this afternoon to talk about my plans to protect and strengthen America’s unions and rebuild the middle class. Tune in:
1180194280536707072 2019-10-04 11:53:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is who Donald Trump is.  A president who abuses the power of the Oval Office to win re-election, turns his back on the fight for democracy in Hong Kong, and puts his own self-interest above the public good.  We have to show the world who we are.
1180176254143778816 2019-10-04 10:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Extreme risk laws save lives. Period.  As president, I will incentivize states to adopt these important laws to help keep guns out of dangerous hands.  Read my full plan to end our gun violence epidemic:  https://t.co/AbTUKdY7Bv  https://t.co/gVurhsNdlO
1180151199644946432 2019-10-04 09:02:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's clear President Trump doesn't care about the farmers and manufacturers being crushed by his reckless trade war—just this week, 160 workers were laid off in the Quad Cities. Enough.  As president, I will end these failed policies and put American workers first.
1180131710551384066 2019-10-04 07:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m not surprised President Trump asked foreign governments for help to beat me and that his special interest friends are spending millions to attack me.  But we can't let the lies, smears, and distortions distract us from what's at stake in this election.  https://t.co/RE9qQ59wHB
1179915284297191425 2019-10-03 17:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The idea of Donald Trump attacking anyone’s integrity is a joke.
1179903959810617349 2019-10-03 16:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our children should not have to worry about their safety at school. Enough is enough. We must take action to end our gun violence epidemic.   https://t.co/AbTUKdY7Bv  https://t.co/FKVffIr49h
1179875019209371648 2019-10-03 14:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> You should need to pass a background check to buy a gun. Period.  I will enact universal background check legislation and close loopholes that allow guns to fall into the wrong hands.  Read my full plan to end gun violence:  https://t.co/AbTUKdGwcV  https://t.co/pEl8KBvwct
1179845362506448897 2019-10-03 12:47:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mr. President, you cannot extort foreign governments to help you win re-election. It’s an abuse of power. It violates your oath of office. And it jeopardizes our national security. I know you want to rig the primary and pick your opponent, but I’m not going anywhere.
1179832237182742530 2019-10-03 11:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re going to do more than just beat President Trump — we’re going to beat him like a drum.  https://t.co/A09Dh7Uqmp
1179813362739232768 2019-10-03 10:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> All the progress we've made on domestic violence and sexual assault has been because of people like Bonnie Campbell. Grateful for her kind words in reflecting on the history of the Violence Against Women Act.  https://t.co/tROLeoy3Me
1179605744745758720 2019-10-02 20:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I will put the integrity of my whole career in public service to this nation up against President Trump's long record of lying, cheating, and stealing any day of the week.  https://t.co/ABf0robBtr
1179547863577223168 2019-10-02 17:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Because of the courage and determination of folks like @GabbyGiffords and groups like @AMarch4OurLives, the fight for gun safety reform has gone from a cause to a movement.  We will end our gun violence epidemic — together. #2020GunSafety  https://t.co/khPWpR0FOc
1179536790312620039 2019-10-02 16:21:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump broke his promise to America's farmers. He campaigned on having their backs, but now his administration is abandoning them and claiming family farms might not survive.   I will expand opportunities for our farmers — not count them out.  https://t.co/8MHkvP8v6E
1179517664630206469 2019-10-02 15:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 52 years ago, Thurgood Marshall became the first African American Supreme Court Justice. A legal giant in the struggle for civil rights—he relentlessly pushed America closer to our promise of liberty, equality, and justice for all. His voice forever changed the course of history.
1179511372893360128 2019-10-02 14:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> En el 1994, el senador Feinstein y yo dirigimos la lucha para prohibir las armas de fuego para asalto y las revistas de alta capacidad. Luchamos contra el @NRA y los vencimos.  Como presidente, volveré a prohibir estas armas de guerra. Las sacaremos de nuestras calles.
1179506339812450304 2019-10-02 14:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In 1994, Senator Feinstein and I led the fight to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We took on the @NRA and got it done.  As president, I’ll ban these weapons of war once again. We will get them off our streets.   https://t.co/AbTUKdY7Bv  https://t.co/u06FKHQv6D
1179486054002376710 2019-10-02 12:59:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm about to take the stage at the #2020GunSafety Forum in Las Vegas to discuss my track record of taking on the @NRA and my new plan to end our gun violence epidemic.   Read the full plan at  https://t.co/KtCufs5X3q and then watch live:
1179483520026198023 2019-10-02 12:49:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is not how an American president should act.
1179464816273965056 2019-10-02 11:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thoughts and prayers won't end our gun violence epidemic. We need courage, and we need leadership. It's past time we take on the @NRA and pass common-sense gun safety reform.  Today, I released my plan to end our gun violence epidemic:  https://t.co/rY7zY4Z3gT
1179417780556312576 2019-10-02 08:28:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@DrBiden and I are sending our best wishes to @BernieSanders, Jane, and the whole Sanders family. Anyone who knows Bernie understands what a force he is. We are confident that he will have a full and speedy recovery and look forward to seeing him on the trail soon.
1179223189408419840 2019-10-01 19:34:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump is morally unfit to lead our country.
1179199820461797376 2019-10-01 18:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump asked a foreign government to interfere in our elections, and now he's spending $10 million on attack ads against me. It's clear that he is trying to influence the primary and pick his opponent.  Why? Because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum.
1179170376506474496 2019-10-01 16:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Weapons of war have no place on our streets.  We must take on the @NRA and ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. I’ve done it before, and I’ll do it again in the White House.  https://t.co/hdVTM6YVF7
1179156534808453121 2019-10-01 15:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> One of my favorite parts of debate night has become meeting our contest winners from around the country. God love ya, JoAnne. Thanks for coming to Houston.  Enter for your chance to join me at the next Democratic debate:  https://t.co/2nIkSTykmS  https://t.co/uPpiaxGe2s
1179142897184186370 2019-10-01 14:15:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> The brave people of Hong Kong deserve the full support of the United States as they demand the civil liberties and autonomy promised to them. Violent suppression is unacceptable. The world is watching.
1179123064275161095 2019-10-01 12:57:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump works for the @NRA.  I’ll work for the American people.  https://t.co/vnuXbsWfDM
1179096137036382209 2019-10-01 11:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Two years ago, we watched in horror as 58 precious lives were cut short in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. As we remember those we lost in Las Vegas, we must honor them with action. We cannot let the scourge of gun violence tear our communities apart any longer.
1178789868811341824 2019-09-30 14:53:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Wonder why President Trump is lying about me? It's because he knows that I will beat him like a drum.  Chip in $5 before tonight’s public fundraising deadline to help us defeat Donald Trump and stop the outrageous lying and cheating he engages in:  https://t.co/I2jAPpnURl  https://t.co/yWcclnx5Zo
1178745073564975105 2019-09-30 11:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Being middle class isn’t a number. It’s a value set. It’s about the issues that matter to every American family: a good education, economic opportunity, access to quality, affordable health care.  We've got to rebuild the middle class and, this time, ensure everyone comes along.
1178693484049510400 2019-09-30 08:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Harris County Deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal was a hero and a trailblazer who selflessly served his community every day. @DrBiden and I are keeping his family and loved ones in our hearts.  https://t.co/82ex0246hj
1178669353987903490 2019-09-30 06:54:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Grateful for the leadership of @fred_guttenberg for finding purpose in tragedy.  We will beat the @NRA and end our gun violence epidemic.  https://t.co/V5FaK1xDnu
1178470766049992704 2019-09-29 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump is trying to hijack this election. We cannot let him get away with it.
1178459189783470082 2019-09-29 16:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can combat climate change. We can end our gun violence epidemic. We can ensure every American has access to quality, affordable health care.  It’s all within our reach if we unite this country. There’s not a single thing we cannot do — together.
1178452395308851201 2019-09-29 16:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must end this epidemic of violence against the transgender community — especially trans women of color. It’s up to all of us to stand up and give hate no safe harbor.  Every American deserves to live open, proud, free and without fear.  https://t.co/zdfQYpEpbZ
1178417917899100160 2019-09-29 14:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s be clear, this attack is designed to weaken our unions and take away workers’ voices on the job. It’s wrong. I stand with Alaska’s public employees.  https://t.co/MbZxu1Ayzz
1178399295655075847 2019-09-29 13:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The science is clear: we cannot wait to take action on climate change.  On day one, I’ll take unprecedented steps to rally the world and tackle this crisis head on. We can and will solve this — together.  https://t.co/YPymjqJZzv
1178384195950989313 2019-09-29 12:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On Monday, $255 million in funding expires for historically black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions. Senate Republicans need to pass the #FUTUREAct now. Our students and educators cannot afford to wait.  https://t.co/tY4o2T36AN
1178344937030471680 2019-09-29 09:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump is trying to hijack this election to distract from how he has turned his back on America's families: sabotaging our health care, prioritizing tax cuts for the super-wealthy, and rolling back our progress on climate change.  We won't let him get away with it.
1178308698407686144 2019-09-29 07:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> To everyone in the Jewish community, @DrBiden and I wish you a very happy, healthy, and sweet New Year. #RoshHashanah  https://t.co/vSwRbJWKlz
1178100153426862081 2019-09-28 17:12:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Trump Administration is responsible for the largest reduction in federally protected land — it’s wrong. As president, I will reverse President Trump's actions and protect our precious federal lands for generations to come. #NationalPublicLandsDay   https://t.co/PMh0u3rvWc
1178054523316604929 2019-09-28 14:11:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need to take the next step in improving our nation’s health care system. The Affordable Care Act was an historic first step — we need to build on it, not start from scratch. I’ll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure everyone has access to affordable, quality health care.
1178033384041304064 2019-09-28 12:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It is long past time to address the devastating effects of climate change. As president, I will take action against those who knowingly harm our environment.  https://t.co/6BHbmlVB37
1178003436823965696 2019-09-28 10:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s clear — we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. It’s time to pick our heads up and show the world who we are. We are the United States of America — there is nothing beyond our capacity.
1177985569055334401 2019-09-28 09:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Yesterday in Las Vegas, we discussed the crucial need to address the gun violence epidemic. Folks, it’s time to pass common-sense gun safety legislation. I’ve beaten the @NRA twice — and as president, I’ll do it again.  https://t.co/5wRme6TCoJ
1177759630858080256 2019-09-27 18:39:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump has turned his back on America’s families. It’s time we rewarded work, not just wealth.  https://t.co/AwSdIyY11l
1177747248613974016 2019-09-27 17:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In America, health care should be a right for all. But time and again, President Trump has made it harder for underrepresented and underserved communities to access the affordable, quality health care they need.  It's shameful, and as president, I will reverse his actions.  https://t.co/CkgGpAekrl
1177719172513615872 2019-09-27 15:58:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are not a country that detains migrant children indefinitely or denies them access to soap, toothbrushes, or beds.  We are a country that welcomes those in search of a better life—the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free.  Trump doesn't get that.
1177680113644851201 2019-09-27 13:23:13 -0800 <JoeBiden> If those in power don't take action to end our gun violence epidemic, we must vote them out. Period.
1177650598868652033 2019-09-27 11:25:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> I remember when we had a president our children could look up to.  https://t.co/hW5VvXG5vU
1177629222518611969 2019-09-27 10:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe our elections should be decided by the American people — not foreign governments.
1177610095120867334 2019-09-27 08:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let's be clear, President Trump is trying to hijack this election.  This isn’t a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue.  https://t.co/me7g8R0h72
1177399960293167104 2019-09-26 18:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s been 11 days since @UAW workers started their strike to fight for higher wages, good benefits, and their fair share of the profits. It’s time for GM to come to the bargaining table with a fair offer that ends the strike and gets its workers back on the job.  https://t.co/rUYr35qFop
1177384860886994951 2019-09-26 17:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every American deserves access to quality, affordable health care—regardless of the state they live in.  We can't let President Trump continue to work with states to undermine Medicaid and prevent low-income Americans from accessing health care.  https://t.co/G55JpxxJHn
1177372529821986816 2019-09-26 17:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day it becomes clearer, the core values of our nation — our very democracy — are at risk with President Trump in the White House.  We must hold Trump accountable. We cannot let him get away with shredding our Constitution.
1177325721204613122 2019-09-26 13:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I want America to be the envy of the world again.  https://t.co/C69oPB7PHH
1177286714072731649 2019-09-26 11:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Income inequality is on the rise across the country — made worse by President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy. We've got to rebuild the middle class and, this time, we’ll make sure everyone comes along.  https://t.co/8aqkJJKkwg
1177246449043562497 2019-09-26 08:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have a President who believes there is no limit to his power, who believes he can do anything and get away with it, and who believes he is above the law.  This isn’t a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue.
1177226819646447621 2019-09-26 07:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If I am elected President, I guarantee you I will protect your family's health care as if it were my own. Because it's personal.  https://t.co/rkH4V5sVP1
1177046380503683072 2019-09-25 19:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Enjoyed sitting down with @jimmykimmel to talk about what’s at stake in this election and the urgent need to make Donald Trump a one-term president.  Tune in to @JimmyKimmelLive tonight!  https://t.co/P3zjYBGOIk
1177020459767873536 2019-09-25 17:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump pressured Ukraine to manufacture a smear against a domestic political opponent — the “transcript” made that clear. It’s an abuse of power that violates the oath of office and undermines our democracy.  Congress must hold him accountable.
1177007373937868800 2019-09-25 16:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Across the country, health care premiums are rising because of President Trump. His attempts to tear down Obamacare have rattled the insurance marketplace and driven up costs for hardworking Americans. It's unacceptable.  https://t.co/vXNaNKXrYW
1176981763626864641 2019-09-25 15:08:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump’s travel ban—the Muslim ban—remains one of his most egregious attacks on our core values. Spewing the politics of fear &amp; slandering an entire religious community as complicit in terrorism is wrong &amp; goes against everything we stand for. We must overturn the ban.
1176952008676388866 2019-09-25 13:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our president put personal politics above his sacred oath. The House must do its job and hold Donald Trump to account for his abuse of power. I will do mine, making my case for a presidency that will mean real help for those in our country who need it most.  https://t.co/NVbk9cnXEx
1176658394519916544 2019-09-24 17:43:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> Inspired by the courage and tenacity of @GretaThunberg. She is right — we cannot fail future generations any longer. We must take urgent, drastic action to address the climate emergency before it’s too late.
1176655052532047872 2019-09-24 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> El derecho al voto es el derecho más sagrado como estadounidense, y depende de nosotros hacer que se escuche nuestra voz en cada elección. Dirígete a  https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M para registrarte para votar y envíalo a cinco amigos para que también se registren.
1176646243952529408 2019-09-24 16:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump cut outreach programs that help people get health insurance coverage. At every turn, he has sabotaged the ACA and made it harder for Americans to access health care. It's wrong.  I'll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure everyone receives the care they need.  https://t.co/cqpSDxQeOm
1176622336415424512 2019-09-24 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Pressuring the leader of another nation to investigate a political opponent — to help win an election — is not the conduct of an American President.  https://t.co/XlaHbHxCMI
1176593538617884673 2019-09-24 13:25:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump's actions are an abuse of power. They undermine our national security. They violate the oath of office. If we allow a President to get away with shredding the United States Constitution — that will last forever.
1176551872225796096 2019-09-24 10:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The right to vote is the most sacred American right there is — and it’s up to all of us to make our voices heard in every election. Head to  https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M to register to vote and then send it to five friends to get them registered. #NationalVoterRegistrationDay
1176531008809816064 2019-09-24 09:17:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> Obamacare was, and is, a big deal. It covered 20 million additional Americans and protects over 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. We can't let President Trump and congressional Republicans tear it down.  Add your name if you agree:  https://t.co/rJSzuDYPcA
1176311538317053964 2019-09-23 18:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The pay gap that Native women face — due to both their gender and the color of their skin — is unacceptable. We must right these wrongs and close the gender pay gap once and for all. #NativeWomensEqualPay
1176303736957726721 2019-09-23 18:14:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Un verano. 26 tiroteos masivos. Incontables vidas truncadas.  No podemos seguir así. Ya es hora de que nos enfrentemos al @NRA, aprobemos la legislación sobre seguridad de armas y terminemos con nuestra epidemia de violencia.  https://t.co/ps0dX2aTCR
1176297697520713728 2019-09-23 17:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve seen firsthand how hard America’s teachers and support staff work with little support and few resources. They deserve better. I’m proud to support Chicago’s educators as they fight for fair wages, full staffing, and smaller class sizes.
1176291859745955840 2019-09-23 17:26:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> Amy, you have nothing to be ashamed of and every reason to be proud. Living open and free is a daily act of bravery — bravery that resides in your heart and in the hearts of LGBTQ people around the world. I’m proud to have you on our team. #BiVisibilityDay
1176284610876952576 2019-09-23 16:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I always enjoy attending the @PolkDems #SteakFry, but the energy that @TeamJoe brought this year made it my favorite one yet. Thank you for a great weekend, Iowa!  https://t.co/VHNVn7lFkh
1176266239968194561 2019-09-23 15:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> One summer. 26 mass shootings. Countless lives cut short.  We cannot go on like this. It’s past time we take on the @NRA, pass common-sense gun safety legislation, and end our gun violence epidemic.  https://t.co/U1tx4ggyVq
1176251140603863040 2019-09-23 14:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Wishing a happy birthday to the rock and roll legend, @springsteen. Your ability to connect with everyday Americans and the issues they face is unrivaled. We are all better off because of your talent, your passion, and your voice.
1176214515068887041 2019-09-23 12:19:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> So release the transcript of the call then.
1176202570492039168 2019-09-23 11:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump and congressional Republicans will stop at nothing to repeal Obamacare. We’ve seen how close they’ve come—just one vote away. We can’t give them another chance.  I'll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure everyone has access to quality, affordable health care.  https://t.co/uI8eOeFLpX
1176152993890263040 2019-09-23 08:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Republicans should never have allowed the 1994 ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines to expire.  As president, I’ll take on the @NRA once again to ban these weapons of war and get them off our streets.
1175993161770045441 2019-09-22 21:39:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight, you made history, @theebillyporter. And as you did it, you reminded us that there is so much more that unites us than divides us. You blazed a trail that will mean so much to so many young people who can now imagine themselves standing on that stage because of you.
1175939998853599239 2019-09-22 18:08:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s time we start rewarding work, not just wealth. America's workers deserve better. I’m proud to stand in solidarity with @UAW.  https://t.co/QgN1792VQq
1175933044357849089 2019-09-22 17:41:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m running for president to restore the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, everyone is going to come along.
1175912911849447424 2019-09-22 16:21:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must take action to end the gun violence epidemic. Enough is enough.  https://t.co/ShgTkAuZag
1175906620326461441 2019-09-22 15:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s be clear, Donald Trump pressured a foreign government to interfere in our elections. It goes against everything the United States stands for.  We must make him a one-term president.
1175896558870642689 2019-09-22 15:16:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, I proudly stood alongside @UAW members on strike in Kansas City as they fight for a fair contract. Everything that defines a middle class life is because of unions fighting for worker protections. I stand with you, and America stands with you.  https://t.co/5tejdcZXnJ
1175871246539591683 2019-09-22 13:35:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're going to beat Donald Trump. Like a drum. Join us:  https://t.co/w4ZGEZeA0y  https://t.co/sBGYPZR4Uc
1175853481346945024 2019-09-22 12:24:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure every American has access to affordable, quality health care. With my plan, if you like your private insurance, you can keep it.  https://t.co/ZJgtBOZHkU
1175842447445807104 2019-09-22 11:41:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m even more optimistic about the future of our country than I was as a 29-year-old in the Senate. We are the United States of America — together, there is nothing we can’t do.  https://t.co/I7hmPFVeIx
1175812248541040640 2019-09-22 09:41:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America was built by hard-working, ordinary people doing extraordinary things. It’s time we start rewarding work, not just wealth.  https://t.co/lLcF9p7mGa
1175524590359105536 2019-09-21 14:37:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> Desperate Donald Trump knows that I can beat him, so now he’s enlisting the help of a foreign government — once again. It’s an abuse of power and violates every basic norm of the presidency.  We cannot give him four more years in the White House.   https://t.co/cqhkBUviAs  https://t.co/vXmH3lTW6k
1175494632203051009 2019-09-21 12:38:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> There's a lot at "steak" in this election. #SteakFry  https://t.co/GTKxYoqo5C
1175482014327328768 2019-09-21 11:48:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> Not a joke, #TeamJoe is strong in Iowa. #SteakFry  https://t.co/JQISaemexx
1175473503556067333 2019-09-21 11:14:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> Stopped by #BidenFest to thank folks for their support before today's #SteakFry!  https://t.co/sGzr0RQVBU
1175469766955417602 2019-09-21 11:00:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> Eight. That’s how many times Donald Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate me and my family.  Why? Because he knows I'll beat him like a drum.  https://t.co/Oc303alcBi
1175443997378170880 2019-09-21 09:17:42 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's wrong what GM is doing to its workers — they deserve better. I'm proud to stand in solidarity with @UAW members on strike as they fight for fair wages, good benefits, and their hard-earned share of the profits.
1175430734624018434 2019-09-21 08:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Happy Homecoming, Delaware State University! I’m biased, but you are the greatest HBCU in the country.
1175403052301520896 2019-09-21 06:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today is a day to celebrate Armenia’s democratic progress and to honor Armenia’s history. That history is not complete unless we recognize, once and for all, the Metz Yeghern—the Armenian Genocide.  https://t.co/240N5ZXLLB
1175245262434033664 2019-09-20 20:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Before tonight's #LGBTQforum in Iowa, I shared why I believe everybody deserves to be treated with dignity and respect under the law — regardless of who they are or whom they love.  https://t.co/h53usuqLA9
1175223174692315139 2019-09-20 18:40:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> LGBTQ rights are the civil rights issue of our time. For all the hard-won progress made in the fight for equality, and for as much as we can celebrate how much better things have gotten, this fight is not over. I’m proud to stand by those who fight for it every day.  https://t.co/UTYvDoLD1R
1175185409963450373 2019-09-20 16:10:10 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, I am back in the Hawkeye State, discussing the issues that impact the lives of LGBTQ Americans at the #IowaForum. Tune in live:  https://t.co/vm5coaATNc
1175181383494488067 2019-09-20 15:54:10 -0800 <JoeBiden> If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country.  https://t.co/PblNGDarXU
1175174219304448005 2019-09-20 15:25:42 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, we remember and honor our nation's prisoners of war and those still missing in action. We have an obligation to fulfill our national promise to our military service members and their families to bring all our heroes home. You are not forgotten. #POWMIARecognitionDay
1175168003622625280 2019-09-20 15:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Last Friday, on the 25th anniversary of VAWA, @DrBiden delivered a powerful message and reminded us that there’s so much more to do. Thank you to @UNHSHARPP for the important work you do every day to support women at UNH.  https://t.co/bCfSLFyi1M
1175145103305764864 2019-09-20 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Saddened to hear of the passing of Maurice Ferré — the father of modern-day Miami. A trailblazer and a true public servant, he paved the way for others as the first Hispanic mayor of Miami. He will be deeply missed. Jill and I are keeping his loved ones in our hearts.
1175103830675066880 2019-09-20 10:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hace dos años, el huracán María tocó tierra en Puerto Rico, devastando la isla y robando la vida de miles. En ese momento en que nuestros compatriotas necesitaron más ayuda, el presidente Trump les falló.  https://t.co/wue61t3SdP
1175103075650080769 2019-09-20 10:43:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Two years ago, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico — devastating the island and killing thousands.  At a time when our fellow Americans needed help the most, President Trump failed them.  https://t.co/GXDDKmN3QV
1175085711340507136 2019-09-20 09:34:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Inspired by the courage and determination of young people across the world as they take to the streets for today’s #ClimateStrike. Climate change is an existential threat that we cannot wait to address. It's up to all of us to take action—future generations are counting on us.
1175081308793593862 2019-09-20 09:16:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> From Universal Pre-K to fighting for raising the minimum wage, @BilldeBlasio has a record of taking on the important issues we face as a nation. Thank you for running a campaign focused on lifting up working families.
1174884636285132800 2019-09-19 20:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@DrBiden and I are thinking of everyone in Texas affected by Tropical Depression Imelda. Please follow the instructions of local authorities and take all necessary precautions to stay safe during this flooding.  https://t.co/f1NIrLKhPU
1174844371230806016 2019-09-19 17:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our students deserve better than four more years of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos.
1174839245053321217 2019-09-19 17:14:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> We started @ItsOnUs with the goal of ending the epidemic of sexual violence on our college campuses. I’m proud of the progress we’ve made, but we have further to go. As we celebrate #5YearsOfItsOnUs, we must recommit to rooting out the toxic culture once and for all.
1174812914202509312 2019-09-19 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Wealthy special interests and corporations have dominated our politics for far too long.  It’s time we overturn Citizens United and create a public financing system for our elections.
1174802343931478016 2019-09-19 14:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Siempre estuve orgulloso de servir junto al presidente Obama, pero nunca más que cuando aprobamos la Ley del Cuidado de Salud a Bajo Costo. Como presidente, protegeré y ampliaré Obamacare para garantizar que cada estadounidense reciba la atención médica que merece.  https://t.co/a47rIpNP8P
1174762582168743936 2019-09-19 12:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I was proud to serve alongside President Obama every day, but never more so than when we passed the Affordable Care Act.  As president, I’ll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure every American receives the health care they deserve:  https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C  https://t.co/HBa1Ewy6tb
1174751257270964225 2019-09-19 11:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> South Carolina is one of only five states without a hate crime law. But this week, @SteveBenjaminSC and the Columbia City Council stood up and declared that hatred and bigotry have no place in their city.  https://t.co/KGqomC7Wvn
1174732383066542084 2019-09-19 10:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I are heartbroken at the passing of Dr. Emily Clyburn. She was a remarkable woman — an activist and community leader, a true partner throughout Jim's career in public office. Jim and the entire Clyburn family are in our hearts during this time of grief.  https://t.co/1DXYCSLgG1
1174688343235452930 2019-09-19 07:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s past time we ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We must get these weapons of war out of our communities.  https://t.co/yTQ4SvqIAR
1174413029120913408 2019-09-18 13:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m more optimistic about America’s future today than I was when I was first elected to the Senate as a 29-year-old kid. There’s not a single thing we cannot do — if we do it together.
1174372182463582208 2019-09-18 10:18:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who believes in science over fiction. As president, I will fight for rigorous fuel economy standards that protect our health, our environment, and our economy.
1174371856528367622 2019-09-18 10:17:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump continues his relentless effort to roll back the hard-fought progress we made in the Obama-Biden Administration. Higher auto emission standards make the air we all breathe cleaner, keep us healthier—and keep our auto industry competitive in the global marketplace.
1174344577865486337 2019-09-18 08:29:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> When domestic abusers have easy access to guns, the result can be fatal. Gov. Sununu should work with the NH legislature to keep guns out of the hands of abusers.   I wrote &amp; passed the Violence Against Women Act. I’ve taken on the NRA twice — and as president, I’ll do it again.
1174332875115827200 2019-09-18 07:42:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Another school year is starting. Another month of Senate Republicans’ inaction on gun violence. This powerful ad from my friends @sandyhook captures the physical and emotional consequences of that inaction.
1174137142345371648 2019-09-17 18:44:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> When I talk about our gun violence epidemic, I’m not only talking about the tragic mass shootings that make national news. I’m also talking about the shootings that occur every day in communities across the nation like Wilmington, Delaware.  We must take on the @NRA and end this.
1174123370075611137 2019-09-17 17:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No one should be fired simply because of who they are or who they love. We must pass the Equality Act and ensure LGBTQ Americans are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.
1174117581764141056 2019-09-17 17:27:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I can promise you that no one will work harder to earn the support of every Amtrak employee.  https://t.co/H7YupBImgi
1174108522319097857 2019-09-17 16:51:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America’s unions and workers are standing up and demanding better. Together, we will rebuild the great American middle class and ensure every worker receives the pay and benefits they deserve.  https://t.co/WvTJAAPUq3
1174096946153185281 2019-09-17 16:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Grateful for all the support at last night’s Galivants Ferry Stump in South Carolina! It’s time we get up, come together as a nation, and lead the world once again. Because there’s not a single thing we cannot do together.  https://t.co/JEoXLGXDWP
1174081091688288256 2019-09-17 15:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our firefighters and teachers should not be paying a higher tax rate than someone making $50 million a year.  We’ve got to repeal President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy and create a tax code that works for the middle class.
1174048879089803265 2019-09-17 12:54:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This afternoon, I’m joining @PhillyAFLCIO at the #Workers2020 Summit to discuss how a Biden administration will rebuild America’s middle class and strengthen the right to organize and collectively bargain. Tune in:  https://t.co/9C0dDa9HZ2
1174026985099714568 2019-09-17 11:27:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Cokie Roberts was a pioneer. Relentless in her pursuit of the truth and steadfast in her commitment to breaking down barriers for women in journalism—our country is better because of it. @DrBiden and I send our prayers to her loved ones at this time.  https://t.co/ARA804negW
1173994017664749568 2019-09-17 09:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you, South Carolina, for a great evening at the Galivants Ferry Stump. As I discussed last night, we’ve got to rebuild America’s middle class. That starts with repealing President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy and rewarding work — not just wealth.  https://t.co/ISrYut1BGO
1173794201240096768 2019-09-16 20:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s always good to be back at the Galivants Ferry Stump!  https://t.co/5Aq57vMzgk
1173760982625214467 2019-09-16 17:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 259 days into 2019.  300 mass shootings.  We cannot go on like this.
1173748651182710785 2019-09-16 17:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America’s farmers continue to pay the price for President Trump’s reckless trade war. He thinks he’s being tough, but it’s easy to act tough when someone else is feeling the pain.  As president, I’ll stand up to China and help working families.  https://t.co/UHhCVLetKD
1173716835000299523 2019-09-16 14:54:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> It is only with persistent effort, fortitude in our actions, and faith in ourselves and the future that change comes. It’s never easy. But I know there’s nothing we can’t accomplish if we stand together as Americans.  https://t.co/oivMtCiSJ8
1173696937381511172 2019-09-16 13:35:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hate only hides, it doesn't go away. We have not relegated white supremacy and racism to the pages of history. But the greatness of this nation has always been, and must continue to be, that we still strive to.  https://t.co/lvwgQLuRfg
1173676582621388806 2019-09-16 12:14:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> Being a nation of immigrants is one of America's greatest strengths. It doesn't matter where your family comes from — we're bound by the same ideals and made up of the same grit and determination to succeed.  https://t.co/wskp3AL5cb
1173396077749428224 2019-09-15 17:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have not relegated racism and white supremacy to the pages of history. Lynch mobs, arsonists, bomb makers, and lone gunmen. We must give hate no safe harbor.  https://t.co/YnyO7V4u0G
1173351282830131200 2019-09-15 14:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Los Estados Unidos es una idea que se ha fortalecido a través de las contribuciones únicas de la comunidad hispana. ¿Dónde estaríamos sin la juez Sonia Sotomayor, César Chávez, @HildaSolis, Dolores Huerta y otros que han mejorado nuestro mundo? #HerenciaHispana
1173350275920400384 2019-09-15 14:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America is an idea that has grown stronger through the unique contributions of Hispanic communities. Where would we be without Justice Sonia Sotomayor, César Chávez, @HildaSolis, Dolores Huerta and others who have changed our world for the better? #HispanicHeritageMonth
1173331871964585984 2019-09-15 13:24:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> A job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about dignity and respect.  Proud to stand with @UAW to demand fair wages and benefits for their members. America's workers deserve better.
1173320120321609728 2019-09-15 12:38:10 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. And at the historic 16th Street Baptist church, there’s no more powerful reminder of what’s at stake. And no more poignant example of what is demanded of us in response.  https://t.co/b74ujQlvQx
1173280566646431744 2019-09-15 10:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, we honor Addie Mae, Cynthia, Carole, Denise, and recommit to defeating the poisonous ideology of white supremacy that lit the fuse at the 16th Street Baptist Church.  https://t.co/6Rjs5ZcBTl
1173249588465213440 2019-09-15 07:57:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m speaking in Birmingham, Alabama, at the 16th St. Baptist Church memorial service. Join me in honoring those we lost:  https://t.co/dsf88Ot9Ka
1173245082641690624 2019-09-15 07:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> At 11:00 AM ET, I’ll be speaking at the 16th Street Baptist Church memorial service to commemorate the lives we lost 56 years ago. Join me in honoring Addie Mae, Cynthia, Carole, and Denise:  https://t.co/miqSzTbr7d
1173020604028661760 2019-09-14 16:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Gun violence tragedies are not inevitable. Together, we can end this epidemic.
1172999163098882048 2019-09-14 15:22:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> So great to visit the Ernest S. Sterling Student Life Center at Texas Southern University. Thanks for letting me join you for lunch. Go Tigers!  https://t.co/1Rb7dCYEvs
1172985612112150529 2019-09-14 14:28:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tomorrow, I’ll be in Birmingham, Alabama, to remember the lives we lost 56 years ago in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. Join me in honoring Addie Mae, Cynthia, Carole, and Denise at 11:00 AM ET.  https://t.co/0Lj0tKQXhI
1172983106682400768 2019-09-14 14:19:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Obamacare fue un gran avance: proporcionó protecciones a más de 100 millones de estadounidenses con afecciones preexistentes. No podemos parar allí. Como presidente protegeré y expandiré Obamacare para garantizar que todos tengamos acceso a atención médica asequible y de calidad.
1172982603109978113 2019-09-14 14:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Obamacare was a huge step forward—providing protections to over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. We can’t stop there. As president, I’ll protect &amp; build on Obamacare to ensure every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care.
1172963477524307968 2019-09-14 13:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My North Star as president will be rebuilding the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we'll make sure everyone comes along.
1172946364625543174 2019-09-14 11:53:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Debemos hacer todo lo que esté a nuestro alcance para abordar la emergencia climática. Como presidente, trabajaré para convertirnos en una economía de energía limpia con emisiones netas cero para el 2050. Volveremos a liderar el mundo en la lucha contra el cambio climático.
1172945861178822656 2019-09-14 11:51:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must do everything in our power to address the climate emergency. As president, I’ll put America on course to become a 100% clean energy economy with net-zero emissions by 2050. We will lead the world in the fight against climate change once again.  https://t.co/Wkc6eSZY8z
1172923966912114689 2019-09-14 10:24:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m running for president because we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. It’s time for us to pick our heads up and remember who we are — this is the United States of America. There’s not a single thing we can’t do.
1172900247061827584 2019-09-14 08:49:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> 25 years ago this week, Senator Feinstein and I led the charge to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We beat the @NRA and got it done.  As president, I’ll do it once again. We will get these military-style weapons off our streets.  https://t.co/VeF6tP1H2K
1172603857538441216 2019-09-13 13:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 25 years ago, the Violence Against Women Act was signed into law, forever changing the culture around sexual assault and domestic violence in our nation. It's one of my proudest accomplishments.  There's still more work to be done—and it's on all of us to finish the job. #VAWA25  https://t.co/skyMifaxqv
1172571394187628545 2019-09-13 11:03:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve learned that the way you deal with loss is by finding purpose — purpose in what you do. #DemDebate  https://t.co/TCfXXL4TwM
1172551764215623681 2019-09-13 09:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> "Nothing about VAWA was easy or uncontroversial. It took four years from when I first introduced the bill in 1990 until it passed."  Read my full op-ed on the 25th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act:  https://t.co/IKcElW5vif
1172530373563056129 2019-09-13 08:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> At last night’s #DemDebate, I discussed my vision for the country and how I'll deliver tangible progress on the most pressing issues facing working families.  I refuse to postpone American possibilities any longer. There’s enormous opportunity once we get rid of Donald Trump.  https://t.co/eBmbdUEpYX
1172345023901270022 2019-09-12 20:03:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> I just stepped off the #DemDebate stage, where I laid out why I’m the only candidate who can take big progressive policies and create tangible results for working families.  If you liked what you heard, help us keep this momentum going by pitching in:  https://t.co/btrAlw3PSA
1172342582451429381 2019-09-12 19:53:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> That’s all we have for tonight, folks! Thanks for following along. Make sure to follow @TeamJoe to stay up-to-date on what’s happening on the campaign. #DemDebate
1172341447359483906 2019-09-12 19:49:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need a president who can deliver progress on the most pressing issues facing Americans. Joe Biden will be that president. #DemDebate
1172341445723742209 2019-09-12 19:49:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> There was only one candidate onstage who has the experience—from Scranton, PA, to the White House—to hit the ground running as President. And that candidate is Joe Biden. #DemDebate
1172341443764998144 2019-09-12 19:49:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> There was only one candidate onstage who helped create—and then signed—a Pledge for Election Integrity, promising to use no disinformation or tolerate outside interference in the election or our democracy. #DemDebate
1172341442347319297 2019-09-12 19:49:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> There was only one candidate onstage who stood at President Obama’s side to lead a nation out of a recession and put middle-class Americans back to work. #DemDebate
1172341441013567490 2019-09-12 19:49:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> There was only one candidate onstage who has flipped a Senator's vote to help pass once-in-a-century health care reform. #DemDebate
1172341439549693953 2019-09-12 19:49:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ten candidates took the stage tonight. But there was only one candidate onstage who has defeated the NRA twice and passed an assault weapons ban. #DemDebate
1172336799688978432 2019-09-12 19:30:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> The American people know Joe Biden. #DemDebate  https://t.co/urSW35YKnJ
1172336133356707840 2019-09-12 19:28:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> It could take 10 years before we get to Medicare for All. We can't wait — people need help now and hope now. #DemDebate  https://t.co/o3G1DENRR4
1172334352807518211 2019-09-12 19:21:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> K-12 education isn’t enough. Many parents don’t have access to early educational resources for their kids. A Biden administration will provide Universal Pre-K, to help ensure that no child’s future is determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability. #DemDebate
1172334349322055682 2019-09-12 19:21:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must invest in resources that support our students' physical and emotional health. A Biden administration will double the number of psychologists, counselors, nurses, social workers, and other health professionals in our schools. #DemDebate  https://t.co/bXqEBbiYnc
1172334340274933760 2019-09-12 19:21:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> There will be no better advocates in the White House for our students and educators than Joe and Jill Biden.  Read our full plan for educators, students, and our future:  https://t.co/d1o4WnUNrt  #DemDebate  https://t.co/ygmktBYbEy
1172333171494379520 2019-09-12 19:16:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> Throughout his career, Joe Biden has:  Fought redlining.  Fought school lines drawn to keep races &amp; classes separate.  Fought to put public housing in white neighborhoods.  Fought for more resources to prosecute hate crimes.  #DemDebate
1172330813536362496 2019-09-12 19:07:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s important to have a plan that meets the urgency of this climate crisis. But it’s going to take more than plans—it’s going to take leadership. Biden has the relationships with key foreign leaders and the experience to get this done. #DemDebate
1172330811909013505 2019-09-12 19:07:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe Biden knows how to rally the world to meet the climate crisis because he’s done it before. Biden worked alongside President Obama to get the world—including China—to agree to the Paris Accord; and he will be prepared on day one of his presidency to push beyond those goals.
1172326924191854593 2019-09-12 18:51:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's past time to end the war in Afghanistan. Joe Biden has long believed that we should narrow our focus to counter-terrorism operations. We can't keep spending tens of billions of dollars every year to sustain a stalemate. #DemDebate
1172324333244444672 2019-09-12 18:41:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we don't write the rules to protect American labor and the environment, China will—and not in a way that advances our values. When it comes to trade, we've got to work with allies—not against them. #DemDebate
1172321785057968132 2019-09-12 18:31:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> For a socialist, Senator Sanders has a lot of confidence in corporate America. #DemDebate  https://t.co/J3gnqHrv4X
1172318832527953921 2019-09-12 18:19:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Obama-Biden Administration did NOT prosecute asylum seekers, or those coming here in search of opportunity. #DemDebate
1172318831437463552 2019-09-12 18:19:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Obama-Biden Administration did NOT terrorize families and indiscriminately target people who had lived here for years. #DemDebate
1172318830242041862 2019-09-12 18:19:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Obama-Biden Administration did not conduct workplace raids—in fact, it ended them. #DemDebate
1172318829034139650 2019-09-12 18:19:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> Attempts to compare President Trump and President Obama on immigration are far-fetched. #DemDebate
1172313314363240451 2019-09-12 17:57:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> Time and again, we’ve seen communities ripped apart by America’s gun violence epidemic. Enough is enough. It needs to end. As president, Biden will tackle this public health crisis. #DemDebate  https://t.co/ujHoQg8O33
1172312828893523969 2019-09-12 17:55:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> After people serve their time, they should have an opportunity to earn a good life and contribute to our country.  Joe’s plan will help give treatment, job training and education opportunities to people both during and after incarceration. #DemDebate  https://t.co/aJEaNV0Rgm
1172312450923806725 2019-09-12 17:54:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are tearing communities apart through mass incarceration. That's why the Biden administration would reform the criminal justice system by:  ✅ Reducing our prison population ✅ Eliminating racial disparities ✅ Making our communities safer  Learn more:  https://t.co/EjZUQBE2zW
1172310899882807296 2019-09-12 17:47:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> There’s enormous opportunity once we get rid of Donald Trump. #DemDebate  https://t.co/gkt6fq4Bvh
1172309499048165376 2019-09-12 17:42:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> Senator Sanders' Medicare for All plan would require raising taxes on the middle class.  Joe Biden: "There will be a deductible—in your paycheck."  #DemDebate
1172308431669055488 2019-09-12 17:38:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> Senator Sanders thinks corporations will give the money they would have spent on health care back to their workers. #DemDebate  Joe Biden:  https://t.co/CmnXUZZOc2
1172306422467416064 2019-09-12 17:30:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> "I know the Senator said she's for Bernie. I'm for Barack."  #DemDebate  https://t.co/PgloBlDka1
1172305542716354561 2019-09-12 17:26:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> 90% of Democrats support protecting and building on Obamacare with a public option like Medicare. #DemDebate  https://t.co/2bJKZYS0Xl
1172305094802432000 2019-09-12 17:24:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> Senators Sanders and Warren would put an end to the employer-sponsored and union-negotiated plans that more than 100 million Americans currently have.  That's a non-starter for us.  #DemDebate
1172304564483047424 2019-09-12 17:22:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s get the facts straight: Medicare for All will cost 30x more than Joe Biden’s health care plan—and it will be paid for in part by raising taxes on the middle class. #DemDebate  https://t.co/1NOJcXFFVs
1172299176656302081 2019-09-12 17:01:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hey everyone — @TeamJoe here! We’re taking over to keep you updated on all the things happening at tonight’s #DemDebate. Make sure to follow along and cheer on Joe!  https://t.co/hhhkT86OxT
1172295362679209984 2019-09-12 16:46:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ready. #DemDebate  https://t.co/GJXM4QRHd9
1172272423816880128 2019-09-12 15:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Helplessly watching your child deal with a life or death condition is one of the worst things a parent can go through. Jill and I are so glad to hear Sadie is doing well, @Bakari_Sellers, and our prayers are with your family as she recovers.  https://t.co/A1K3yPUpkO
1172249774554324997 2019-09-12 13:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump’s decision to take billions from the military to build his wall is an unabashed abuse of power. It endangers the American people and forfeits investments in our future, security, and children — all to score political points.  https://t.co/CeQr87Oxcv
1172212626715271168 2019-09-12 11:17:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Trump Administration is denying Temporary Protected Status to Bahamians escaping the devastation of Hurricane Dorian. It’s heartless and goes against everything we stand for as a nation.  The cruelty of this administration truly knows no bounds.
1172177884385075200 2019-09-12 08:59:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> Barack Obama was a great president. We don’t say that enough.  https://t.co/FLiYpg8jLR
1172169244131377152 2019-09-12 08:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Beth James is strong, courageous, and resilient. Her story is the story of millions of women all across this country. It’s why I worked so hard to pass the Violence Against Women Act — and it’s why I’m committed to changing the toxic culture that still pervades our society today.  https://t.co/gisDYqUDsQ
1171966155558248448 2019-09-11 18:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> All workers deserve the right to bargain for good wages, benefits and working conditions—including gig workers. That is why I'm pleased the CA Legislature passed AB5. As president, I will enact a federal law to ensure gig workers get the full protections they deserve.
1171957628643270659 2019-09-11 18:24:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Climate change doesn’t only threaten our environment — it threatens our economy, health, and national security. We must take urgent action to address this crisis before it’s too late.
1171778670421168134 2019-09-11 06:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Each 9/11, we remember that resilience and courage live in the hearts of all Americans—especially our brave first responders. 18 years later, we reaffirm that Americans will never bend to terrorism, and we will never forget those we lost.
1171580363757559809 2019-09-10 17:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> La fuerza de los Estados Unidos está y siempre ha estado arraigada en nuestra diversidad. Los inmigrantes siempre nos han hecho más fuertes. Donald Trump no entiende eso.
1171577846923350016 2019-09-10 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America’s strength is and has always been rooted in our diversity. Immigrants have always made us stronger. Donald Trump doesn’t get that.
1171561489087569920 2019-09-10 16:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Puerto Rico aún se está recuperando de la devastación del huracán María. Ahora, en lugar de apoyar la reconstrucción, Trump está desviando $400 millones de dólares para su construir su muro que estaban planificados para proyectos militares en Puerto Rico. Es inaceptable.
1171560230955565056 2019-09-10 16:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Puerto Rico is still rebuilding from the devastation of Hurricane Maria. Now, instead of supporting the recovery, President Trump is defunding $400 million in planned military projects in Puerto Rico to build his wall. It's unacceptable.
1171540350067806215 2019-09-10 14:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> JoAnne, the good news is the bad news: you won the contest, and you're coming to Houston with me. Grateful for JoAnne's support and that of our incredible supporters.  https://t.co/MalsrJMocw
1171518203974967296 2019-09-10 13:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> South Carolina lawmakers are rushing through an extreme law that is a direct violation of a woman’s constitutional right to choose. It’s wrong, it’s dangerous, and we must fight it. This decision should remain between a woman and her doctor.  https://t.co/MR1CTmA3rY
1171502013378527233 2019-09-10 12:13:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> 20 million people gained coverage under Obamacare. But after countless attacks on the law by the Trump Administration, the uninsured rate increased for the first time since 2010 — leaving an additional 1.9 million people uninsured.  As president, I'll defend and build on the ACA.
1171478441893552129 2019-09-10 10:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There is no distinction between mental health and physical health — it’s health. On #WorldSuicidePreventionDay, we must recommit to eliminating the stigma around mental health and ensuring everyone has access to the care they need.
1171462084237910016 2019-09-10 09:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s Election Day in #NC09 — grab a friend and get out and vote for @McCreadyForNC. Polls are open until 7:30 PM, and you can find your polling place here:  https://t.co/ZP5Ummu2Jw
1171430626781814784 2019-09-10 07:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I support @McCreadyForNC because of his honorable service to our nation &amp; because of his values: he'll fight to protect North Carolinian’s health care &amp; take on prescription drug companies.  If his opponent has his way, 44,000 people in #NC09 stand to lose their health coverage.
1171243617186439169 2019-09-09 19:06:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’ve got to choose science over fantasy — and that starts with getting rid of this administration.
1171184178890756096 2019-09-09 15:10:42 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every American deserves to retire with dignity. But today, too many people — especially older Americans — cannot afford their prescription drugs. I sat down with AARP to discuss how I’ll stand up to the abuse of power by drug corporations and lower costs for Americans.
1171167644357148673 2019-09-09 14:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m still fired up from the incredible energy at the #NHDems2020 convention. Thank you to everyone from @TeamJoe who came out to show your support!  https://t.co/TEJCpZLX9v
1171139287510913030 2019-09-09 12:12:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hurricane Dorian devastated the Bahamas, leaving nearly 70,000 people homeless. It’s our moral responsibility to do everything we can to help Bahamians — not turn them away.  This isn’t who we are.
1171125617179295744 2019-09-09 11:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> With Congress back in session, passing gun safety legislation should be the first order of business. It’s past time for Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans to stand up to the @NRA and take concrete action to end our gun violence epidemic.  https://t.co/S8GSiYmrVe
1171101458139353088 2019-09-09 09:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Young Americans are especially worried about climate change and know it is not just a domestic priority — it's a foreign policy one. I agree. And I'm ready to tackle this on day one.  https://t.co/evUnnqUCoS  https://t.co/vMgLVZlv5R
1171085855177334784 2019-09-09 08:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m inspired by John and grateful for his support. My message to him is clear: never give up and never let it define you.  https://t.co/y7Lo8whWOa
1170806514472247296 2019-09-08 14:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mexico isn’t paying for the wall. American military families are.   China isn’t paying for the tariffs. American farmers and manufacturers are.   The American people continue to foot the bill for President Trump’s senseless political games.
1170747878085681152 2019-09-08 10:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The deadliest mass shootings all have one thing in common: assault weapons.  It’s past time we get these weapons of war off our streets. I’ve banned them before, and I’ll ban them again in the White House.  https://t.co/iyKWqhyIIz
1170479358554910720 2019-09-07 16:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I’ll invest in our K-12 schools to eliminate the funding gap between majority white and non-white districts, and rich and poor districts. No child’s future should be determined by their zip code, parents’ income, or race.  https://t.co/hHruW4f2BZ
1170461742645706753 2019-09-07 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. We have to let them know who we are.   We choose hope over fear. Unity over division. Science over fiction. And truth over lies.   #NHDems2020  https://t.co/wClqhO5xO8
1170454192911044609 2019-09-07 14:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Obamacare prohibits insurers from denying coverage for the 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions.  President Trump wants to gut the ACA and tear that protection away. We can’t forget that.
1170410226039889922 2019-09-07 11:55:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's time we reward work, not just wealth.  https://t.co/5VHINGqBxu
1170376682164736000 2019-09-07 09:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The @TeamJoe energy outside of the #NHDems2020 convention was incredible!  https://t.co/rIeRpyyqZD
1170347157221720066 2019-09-07 07:44:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> Stopped by to say hello to @TeamJoe before this morning’s #NHDems2020 convention. Thank you for all your hard work! Keep it going!  https://t.co/xUyT5080Yj
1170170574104145920 2019-09-06 20:03:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to everyone who joined us in Laconia and New Castle. As I discussed this evening, we’ve got to do everything in our power to end this gun violence epidemic. That starts with passing universal background checks and banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.  https://t.co/4MR5KuQrDd
1170132070733103104 2019-09-06 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Las políticas de inmigración del presidente Trump son un asalto a la dignidad humana y todo lo que representamos como nación. Por esto hay que acabar con ellas.  https://t.co/otwGtLfHyM
1170130812114808832 2019-09-06 17:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump’s immigration policies are an assault on human dignity and everything we stand for as a nation. We must end them.  https://t.co/otwGtLfHyM
1170121500784881665 2019-09-06 16:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is the United States of America. There is not a single thing we have not been able to accomplish once we set our minds to it.  Together, we can and will meet the challenge of this climate emergency.  https://t.co/tiLZIyMRgQ
1170106904724553729 2019-09-06 15:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Iran Deal put Iran's nuclear program in a box. Trump walked away from the deal, and now Iran is advancing its program. This is another reminder that Trump's manufactured crisis is making the U.S., the region, and our world less safe.  https://t.co/KXD7Bdb5kU
1170078970441809922 2019-09-06 13:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The fight against cancer is personal for me — like it is for so many Americans. It’s why I’m committed to ending cancer as we know it.  https://t.co/NAsBNU0j6l
1170070320373477377 2019-09-06 13:24:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> America has stood as a beacon of hope for generations. Now, President Trump wants to slam the door in the face of those fleeing persecution. It's cruel and damages our global standing.  I'll ensure we meet our responsibility as a nation to the world's most vulnerable people.
1170057831317295105 2019-09-06 12:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We all have a responsibility to stand up and speak out when we see abuse of power. Silence is complicity.  https://t.co/y03WGsYigi
1170003221332537351 2019-09-06 08:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump stokes the flames of hatred, coddles white nationalists with messages of support, and preys on our deepest divisions. If we give him four more years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.  We can’t let that happen.
1169991645225308160 2019-09-06 08:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I always enjoy sitting down to chat with my friend @StephenAtHome. Check out a few of my favorite moments from the interview.  https://t.co/723faRbi6A
1169755841450401795 2019-09-05 16:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump is dead wrong on climate change. We’ve got to choose science over fantasy and treat it like the existential threat that it is.  As president, I would rally the world to take unprecedented action. There would be no empty chair at the G-7.  https://t.co/QvLCIM39oV
1169726901079822337 2019-09-05 14:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hace dos años, el presidente Trump intentó terminar con DACA, obligando a nuestros DREAMers a vivir con miedo y caos. Es cruel.  Los soñadores son estadounidenses. Es hora de que el Congreso cumpla con nuestra promesa y les proporcione un camino hacia la ciudadanía.
1169713311149154304 2019-09-05 13:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Two years ago, President Trump attempted to end DACA—throwing lives into chaos &amp; forcing our DREAMers to live in fear as the Supreme Court decides their fate. It's cruel.   DREAMers are Americans. It's time for Congress to keep our promise to them &amp; provide a path to citizenship.
1169697204962914304 2019-09-05 12:42:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Despite what the @NRA says, the assault weapons ban that @SenFeinstein and I championed worked. It saved lives.   I’ll ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines once again. We will get these weapons of war off our streets.  https://t.co/KpXXPzjYjJ
1169657946529120256 2019-09-05 10:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Last night, @StephenAtHome asked me what the defining factor was in my decision to run for president. My answer was clear: Charlottesville.  https://t.co/NN335Bxsvk
1169448838878441473 2019-09-04 20:15:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thanks for having me on, @jimmykimmel!
1169446050169384960 2019-09-04 20:04:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s critical to have a plan to combat climate change, but it’s going to take more than plans — it’s going to take leadership. I have the experience and relationships necessary to rally the world to meet the urgency of this climate crisis. #ClimateTownHall  https://t.co/aXvhwUDHMq
1169412790928453632 2019-09-04 17:51:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> That’s all we have for tonight’s CNN #ClimateTownHall! Make sure to follow @TeamJoe to stay up-to-date on everything happening on the campaign.
1169412485566406656 2019-09-04 17:50:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe Biden grounded his plan in the science — in what the world’s leading climatologists and the UN tells us we need to achieve. It provides a comprehensive path forward on how to address the most pressing issue of our time.  https://t.co/evUnnqUCoS
1169410953793933317 2019-09-04 17:44:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> Under Joe Biden’s plan for a clean energy revolution and environmental justice, we will:   ✅ Achieve a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050 ✅ Rejoin the #ParisAgreement on day one and rally the world to go further ✅ Stand up to polluters  #ClimateTownHall  https://t.co/7UP1GoZYUv
1169410289651130368 2019-09-04 17:41:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump continues to:  🔴 Deny the science in front of his own eyes 🔴 Attack the progress made by the Obama-Biden Administration 🔴 Spew lies like “windmills cause cancer”  Defeating him is essential to making any progress on climate change. #ClimateTownHall
1169409577730879488 2019-09-04 17:39:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> Climate change is an urgent threat to our environment, health, economy, and national security. There’s no time for on-the-job training. We need a leader who is ready on day one — and that’s Joe Biden. #ClimateTownHall
1169404997387345921 2019-09-04 17:20:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> The clean energy economy of the future presents an enormous opportunity. President Biden will create 10 million well-paying jobs in the United States that will grow a stronger, more inclusive middle class in communities across the country. #ClimateTownHall
1169404609795907584 2019-09-04 17:19:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face. It powerfully captures two core truths:  1️⃣ This is an existential crisis requiring immediate, ambitious action. 2️⃣ Our environment and economy are connected.  #ClimateTownHall
1169403859221041154 2019-09-04 17:16:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> If Joe Biden was president, there would be no empty chair at the G-7. #ClimateTownHall
1169402343567196160 2019-09-04 17:10:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can't turn a blind eye to the way in which environmental burdens are distributed unevenly along racial and socioeconomic lines.  Biden will right these wrongs and stand up to fossil fuel companies  who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities.
1169401097590648837 2019-09-04 17:05:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here’s the deal: Joe Biden introduced one of the first climate change bills in the Senate, and he’s been at the forefront of the fight ever since.  Don’t just take our word for it, @PolitiFact called Joe Biden a climate change pioneer. #ClimateTownHall   https://t.co/xti5vounyv
1169400747282358277 2019-09-04 17:03:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> On day one as president, Joe Biden will take action to put the United States on track to achieve a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions no later than 2050  Because action on climate change can’t wait. #ClimateTownHall  https://t.co/YWw0tFodt2
1169400376858226698 2019-09-04 17:02:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hey everyone — @TeamJoe here! We’re taking over for tonight’s CNN #ClimateTownHall. We’ll keep you updated as Joe Biden takes the stage to discuss his plans to combat climate change.
1169397351011762178 2019-09-04 16:50:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tune in to the @colbertlateshow tonight at 11:35 PM ET!  https://t.co/tkNbnttzMF
1169349413145387009 2019-09-04 13:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> For too long, partisan gerrymandering has allowed politicians to rig the political process and draw districts in their favor. Voters should choose their representatives — not the other way around.  https://t.co/RrJvJMcNyR
1169329281110949888 2019-09-04 12:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Looking forward to talking with @StephenAtHome about what’s at stake in this election and why I’m running for president.   Tune in to the @colbertlateshow tonight!  https://t.co/9gJ4KPSLeL
1169298578558394371 2019-09-04 10:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump promised Mexico would pay for his border wall. That was never going to happen. And now he’s raiding billions from our military to pay for it.   https://t.co/9sBLAZysdB
1169041131952168962 2019-09-03 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Four years of Betsy DeVos is more than enough.  As president, I’ll name a Secretary of Education who is actually an educator.
1169029052306345984 2019-09-03 16:27:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If those in power fail to take action on gun safety reform we must vote them out. Period.  https://t.co/xTEzC634Ca
1168973808621031424 2019-09-03 12:47:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is an important step by Walmart, but we must go further. If we want to end our gun violence epidemic, we must start by passing universal background checks and banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.  It's your turn to act, Senate Republicans.
1168946508349075456 2019-09-03 10:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As I told Pauline yesterday in Iowa, if there are any angels in heaven, they are all nurses.  https://t.co/A3rYhsGzok
1168922852415791104 2019-09-03 09:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In America, health care should be a right for all — not a privilege for the few. My plan to protect and build on Obamacare will expand coverage, lower costs, and ensure every American receives the care they need.  https://t.co/uw7Kk0ONHA
1168720519316664320 2019-09-02 20:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I've always stood with America's unions, and as president, I'll fight alongside them to protect and strengthen the right to organize and collectively bargain.  https://t.co/4VDjf0xqsT
1168693843509661696 2019-09-02 18:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The 40-hour workweek Minimum wage Overtime pay  They’re all because of unions. It’s time we recognize that.
1168667922845315072 2019-09-02 16:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Stopped for some Dairy Queen Blizzards with the team between events in Iowa.  https://t.co/GraJHqEAlq
1168639736984064004 2019-09-02 14:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Stopped by the Hawkeye Area Labor Council Labor Day Picnic to thank folks for their tireless work fighting for American workers. From fair wages to safe working conditions — we owe our unions so much.  https://t.co/1ALkfgImZF
1168625392619409408 2019-09-02 13:43:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> What a great few days in South Carolina. I’ll be back soon!  https://t.co/Wt2tq1Eq13
1168592616436436992 2019-09-02 11:32:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> Say thank you—because these are the people who make America run. Not the Wall Street bankers. Not the CEOs or hedge fund managers. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things.
1168592615048196098 2019-09-02 11:32:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> Say thank you to the people who build our roads and bridges. Keep our water systems working. Teach our kids and take care of the sick among us. Race into our burning buildings. Grow our food, build our cars, and pick up the garbage off our streets.
1168592613248815104 2019-09-02 11:32:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> This Labor Day, when you cross paths with someone working a job that makes your day-to-day life better—and I promise you, it will happen many times today—tell them "thank you."   Tell them you appreciate the work that they do. That it matters to you, and to your community.
1168544107289030657 2019-09-02 08:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This Labor Day, we celebrate the battles waged and victories won by organized labor. Unions built the great American middle class, and it’s time we recognize that.  I promise you if I’m elected president, unions will have no stronger champion in the White House.  https://t.co/u8kcyq5zBg
1168301256714014721 2019-09-01 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Together, we will beat the @NRA. We will end this gun violence epidemic.
1168260991404011520 2019-09-01 13:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It has been 186 days since the House passed the bipartisan universal background check bill.    @Senatemajldr Mitch McConnell and the Senate should pass it immediately.   Lives are at stake.
1168245891922161664 2019-09-01 12:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Les Gelb was a giant of American foreign policy, and several generations of thinkers and policy makers owe their success to Les' mentorship and intellectual generosity. @DrBiden and I send our deepest condolences to Judy, Adam, Caroline, Alison and all his grandchildren.
1168236077116796932 2019-09-01 11:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Yesterday, a 17-month-old was shot on our streets.    It’s past time we take on the @NRA, pass gun safety reform, and end this epidemic once and for all. We simply cannot go on like this.  https://t.co/Gih4m5iUFm
1167965983127945217 2019-08-31 18:02:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m heartbroken, sickened, &amp; angry. Weeks after the horror in El Paso, another community in Texas has been terrorized by gun violence. Enough. We must end this epidemic.  @DrBiden &amp; I send our thoughts to those affected &amp; thank our law enforcement who responded at great risk.
1167912444569759744 2019-08-31 14:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Obamacare covered 20 million additional Americans, protects over 100 million with pre-existing conditions, and allows young adults to stay on their parents’ coverage until age 26.  We can’t afford to tear it down and start over. We should protect and build on it.
1167880987356946432 2019-08-31 12:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On Thursday, 10-year-old Marcus asked me an important question about President Trump.  https://t.co/AJeUAXW5ST
1167852047057772546 2019-08-31 10:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Like all bullies, President Trump is trying to make himself seem stronger by picking on the most vulnerable among us — but I would have thought even he would understand that kids with cancer were off-limits.   He is morally unfit to lead this country.  https://t.co/nmG7dEwr6Q
1167842033559584768 2019-08-31 09:50:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> @GovernorBullock Thanks for the recommendation, @GovernorBullock! I’d love to try it next time I’m in Decorah.
1167826880776613894 2019-08-31 08:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m grateful for the sacrifice Tom made in service to our country. We owe our veterans more than we could ever repay — and it’s our sacred obligation to care for them and their families when they return home.  https://t.co/JXpPgGXbqz
1167807457822957568 2019-08-31 07:32:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@DrBiden and I are thinking of everyone in the path of Hurricane Dorian. Please heed the warnings from authorities, take steps to prepare, and stay safe.
1167558016301961216 2019-08-30 15:01:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our cash bail system disproportionately harms low-income folks and criminalizes poverty. It’s wrong.   It’s time we end cash bail and reform our pretrial system by instead putting in place a system that is fair and does not inject further discrimination or bias into the process.
1167532692407107584 2019-08-30 13:21:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I am deeply disappointed that Regal Beloit chose to close its doors and lay off over 150 workers instead of finding a resolution with the @MachinistsUnion. Every worker deserves good wages, affordable health care, and strong workplace protections.  https://t.co/OOTFb1XT3q
1167498078452146176 2019-08-30 11:03:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> Had a great town hall in Greenville yesterday where we discussed our plans increase mental health services in schools &amp; ensure educators are receiving the pay they deserve. Thank you for a great trip, South Carolina!  https://t.co/OJfPcIjOy2
1167491923679924224 2019-08-30 10:39:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m looking forward to taking the stage in Houston on September 12th for the next Democratic debate!   Folks across the country are coming together and hosting parties in their communities to watch the debate. Sign up to host one in your town:  https://t.co/TZzbCCadc7
1167256120089600001 2019-08-29 19:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I can’t believe I have to say this: We should not deport children seeking treatment in the U.S. for life-threatening illnesses.  https://t.co/7ng4vwHHKg
1167246808764100609 2019-08-29 18:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Esta no es solo una campaña para vencer a Donald Trump - es un movimiento basado en los valores que definen nuestra nación: la honestidad, la decencia, y el tratar a todos con dignidad y respeto, mientras le damos la espalda al odio. Eso es lo que somos como estadounidenses.
1167242530448125952 2019-08-29 18:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This can’t just be a campaign to beat Donald Trump. This has to be a movement grounded in the values and ideals that define our nation best: honesty, decency, treating everyone with dignity and respect, and giving hate no safe harbor.  That’s who we are as Americans.
1167236192674439168 2019-08-29 17:42:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> Como tantos otros han dicho, la crueldad es su meta. Es su única meta, y es lo único que tienen para postularse: el miedo, la ira, la división y la crueldad. Debemos restaurar el alma de nuestra nación.
1167236191864930305 2019-08-29 17:42:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> No hay justificación para traumatizar aún más a los niños enfermos en sus momentos más vulnerables. Como todo abusón, Trump está acosando a los más débiles, pero atacar a niños con cáncer y fibrosis quística es intolerable.
1167236191214854146 2019-08-29 17:42:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> No sabemos ya qué decir para condenar la inhumanidad de esta administración que arranca niños de los brazos de sus padres y acosa a las familias en sus vecindarios. Ahora deportará a niños que están recibiendo tratamientos de vida o muerte por afecciones graves.
1167233474316689410 2019-08-29 17:32:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump has found his newest target — sick children. It's sinful.  https://t.co/dgFT0vNbYC
1167167536892448768 2019-08-29 13:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Grateful to everyone who attended our town hall at Clinton College. As I discussed this morning, we need to stand up to President Trump’s constant attacks on immigrants and end his inhumane policies. We’re stronger because of our diversity — not in spite of it.  https://t.co/yo7IxNVI3K
1167147403801030656 2019-08-29 11:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we give Donald Trump four more years in the White House, the planet may never recover.  https://t.co/h2N0hn6k6L
1167132052585615362 2019-08-29 10:49:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hello, Clinton College!  https://t.co/luc3BkRo3M
1167099528396398592 2019-08-29 08:39:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> It wasn't a setup, I swear.  https://t.co/j3lpThTrWh
1167097538308165632 2019-08-29 08:31:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> As so many others have said, cruelty is their point. It is their only point, and it’s all they have to run on: fear, anger, division, and cruelty. We must restore the soul of our nation.
1167097536735264768 2019-08-29 08:31:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> There is no national security justification for further traumatizing sick kids at their most vulnerable. Like all bullies, Trump is purposefully targeting the little guys—but I would have thought even he would understand that kids with cancer and cystic fibrosis were off-limits.
1167097535913234432 2019-08-29 08:31:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are running out of words to condemn the inhumanity of this administration. An administration that pulls children from the arms of their parents and stalks families in their neighborhoods will now deport children who are in life-saving treatment for dire conditions like cancer.
1166917136414957569 2019-08-28 20:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our military families sacrifice everything in service to our nation. And today, the Trump Administration revoked automatic citizenship for some of their children.   It's reprehensible and cruel. As president, I'll reverse it immediately.  https://t.co/WgizSndgMF
1166887692338003970 2019-08-28 18:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Wrapped up our day at Limestone College. I enjoyed hearing from students about the need to reform our criminal justice system and get assault weapons off our streets. I know with these young folks at the helm, America's best days still lie ahead.  https://t.co/nJYx1zzlsJ
1166880577213087746 2019-08-28 18:09:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@SenGillibrand ran a strong, courageous campaign. From championing gender equality to fighting dark money in politics—Senator Gillibrand is always willing to take on the tough fights we face. I know the senator will ensure these issues stay at the center of the national debate.
1166865546329174016 2019-08-28 17:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 56 years ago, the March on Washington and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s “I Have a Dream” speech changed the course of history. As we mark the anniversary, we must reaffirm our commitment to fulfilling America's founding promise. We can't rest until justice truly rings out for all.  https://t.co/XrxJQe6yPt
1166853718366740480 2019-08-28 16:23:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Was on the hunt for doughnuts in Spartanburg. Mission accomplished.  https://t.co/vLGPdDlGHq
1166850195306553349 2019-08-28 16:09:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 64 years ago, 14-year-old Emmett Till was brutally murdered in Mississippi. His death sparked national outrage and served as a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement. It serves as a reminder of the need to reject intolerance in all its forms. We must give hate no safe harbor.
1166845745493942274 2019-08-28 15:51:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> He honorably served our nation in uniform and in Congress, he would make his home proud every single day. I admire Dan and am thrilled to support him.
1166845744755724288 2019-08-28 15:51:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@McCreadyForNC is precisely the kind of leader that North Carolina deserves: one who'll put country over party, who's brought jobs to his community, and who will protect coverage for those with preexisting conditions — not dismantle it to cut taxes for the rich.
1166811691608264704 2019-08-28 13:36:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to everyone who came out to our town hall in Spartanburg, South Carolina! As I shared this afternoon, we need to repeal President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy, make college more affordable, and rebuild America’s middle class.  https://t.co/Z1PWPThlTV
1166795729131716609 2019-08-28 12:32:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> What kind of leader taunts their own people as they prepare for a natural disaster?   Puerto Rico deserves the full support and aid of our government as Hurricane Dorian approaches.
1166526059392589825 2019-08-27 18:41:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I stood before the nation 11 years ago tonight in Denver and accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination for vice president. I’m still humbled by the immense trust and faith you placed in President Obama and me.  It’s an evening I’ll never forget.  https://t.co/jwxZJCEuBn
1166517754746195968 2019-08-27 18:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump is taking millions from FEMA disaster relief in the midst of hurricane season to further fuel the crisis at the border.  It makes about as much sense as nuking hurricanes.  https://t.co/sAmCB3SKO6
1166508192685273088 2019-08-27 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Roe v. Wade is settled law. State laws attacking a woman’s right to choose should be declared unconstitutional. This decision should remain between a woman and her doctor.  https://t.co/zL5fFjiJF2
1166496867036860417 2019-08-27 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Kayden, 2 Kristina, 16 Jashon, 16 Kennedi, 3 Charnija, 11 Myiesha, 16 Derrel, 15 Eddie, 10 Xavier, 7 Jason, 16 Jurnee, 8 Sentonio, 15   12 children, full of so much promise, taken far too soon. It's heartbreaking. Our inaction is a moral failure.   https://t.co/LK2T61eOHl
1166486297634103296 2019-08-27 16:03:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As I told folks in Croydon, New Hampshire, we’ve got to unite this country. Because if we come together and remember who we are as Americans, there’s not a single thing we can’t do.  https://t.co/97dahJmlNo
1166438985780137984 2019-08-27 12:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Trump Administration continues to attack the progress the LGBTQ community has made. As president, passing the Equality Act will be a top legislative priority, because no one should be fired simply because of who they are or whom they love.  https://t.co/X62KbDPTht
1166416336513187840 2019-08-27 11:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> American factory workers, farmers, and consumers are the ones paying the price for President Trump’s reckless trade wars—not China. To Trump, the people getting hurt—like those laid off last week in South Carolina—are just pawns in his political games.  https://t.co/RRMvVsHrRT
1166384879371792384 2019-08-27 09:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, we're launching #StudentsForBiden, a nationwide program for change-makers committed to organizing their campuses and making Donald Trump a one-term president.  If that sounds like you, join today and let's get to work:  https://t.co/nWF914sJFc  https://t.co/x5hGqBfPUC
1166380893163966464 2019-08-27 09:04:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> When it comes to meeting the existential crisis of our time, Trump has walked away from the table — literally. If we give Trump four more years, the planet may never recover from his utter disregard for the climate crisis and scientific fact.
1166380892144787457 2019-08-27 09:04:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> The distance Trump has put between the U.S. and the rest of the world on the issues that matter most to Americans couldn't be more clear. There is no more telling metaphor for this administration's abdication of American leadership than the empty chair at the G-7 climate meeting.
1166380891347783680 2019-08-27 09:04:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> After three days, we have even more evidence of how President Trump's disastrous foreign policy has left the U.S. isolated. Rather than looking to America for vision, our closest democratic allies sought to manage and mitigate the damage Trump might do at this year's G-7.
1166319450909315072 2019-08-27 05:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This ad wasn’t easy for me to record.  Health care is personal to me. Deeply personal.  https://t.co/a8UNsnkLhI
1166147062150266881 2019-08-26 17:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The fact of the matter is, the greed of drug companies fueled an opioid epidemic that has ravaged communities in every corner of the country. They should be held accountable for their actions, and this is an important step.  https://t.co/sXem3GUt88
1166138505845604353 2019-08-26 17:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Happy #InternationalDogDay from Major and camera-shy Champ!  https://t.co/haKhxniUYd
1166123611628982281 2019-08-26 16:01:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> The fires ravaging the Amazon are devastating. The Amazon serves as the lungs of our planet and is home to an invaluable number of plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth. We must take global action to stop the destruction and support reforestation before it’s too late.
1166091697341616129 2019-08-26 13:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m grateful that Gene shared his story. The battle against cancer is personal for me, like it is for so many Americans. But I’m confident — with the power of America’s best minds — we will end cancer as we know it.  https://t.co/x5TJ0IHplu
1166030041106399236 2019-08-26 09:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America was built on a simple proposition: all men — and women — are created equal. We haven't lived up to that promise for most, but haven't stopped trying. As we celebrate the 19th Amendment and #WomensEqualityDay, we must continue our fight to truly achieve equality for all.
1165759508506800128 2019-08-25 15:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s simple—everyone has the right to live proud, open, and free. And as I said to Kevin and Michael—LGBTQ rights are civil rights.  https://t.co/KSs8lVgrze
1165741388966711297 2019-08-25 14:43:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> No one should have to choose between putting food on their table or filling their prescription. That’s why the Biden administration will stand up to prescription drug corporations and take concrete action to lower costs for Americans. Read more:  https://t.co/uw7Kk0ONHA
1165724527822700545 2019-08-25 13:36:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Across the country, folks like Ryan are doing the crucial work of organizing their communities and talking with neighbors about what’s at stake in this election. I’m so proud to have him on our team.   Sign up to get involved in your community:  https://t.co/IVSb97oJaS  https://t.co/Eu4ukxNzyQ
1165716350838480896 2019-08-25 13:03:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> La emergencia climática que enfrentamos no solo afecta nuestro medio ambiente, sino que también amenaza nuestra salud, seguridad nacional y bienestar económico. Necesitamos tomar medidas urgentes y drásticas para abordarlo ya, lo que haré como presidente.
1165690302432047104 2019-08-25 11:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today marks 25 years since the Senate passed a bill to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines—an effort I championed with Senator Feinstein   The ban became law and it worked. It saved lives. As president, I will ban them once again.  https://t.co/TCRtqtvg5g
1165656439492399104 2019-08-25 09:05:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> John lived his life bound by a timeless code — decency, respect, and civility above all else. This week, as we remember his life and service, let's honor his legacy by living out that code. I hope you'll join me and engage in #ActsOfCivility.  https://t.co/JwJcz87NVq
1165656438615740423 2019-08-25 09:05:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> A year ago, we lost a true patriot, a hero, and to me—a friend. John McCain's character, courage, and honor made him a giant among all of us. His deep, unshakeable belief in the soul of America and our values inspired us all and provided hope to the world. I miss him every day.
1165434869163405313 2019-08-24 18:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Highly recommend the grilled cheese and milkshakes at Lindy’s Diner. Thanks for a great send-off, New Hampshire!  https://t.co/1AlWvQGQi7
1165427319516880896 2019-08-24 17:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The climate emergency we’re facing not only impacts our environment — it also threatens our health, national security, and economic well-being. We need to take urgent, drastic action now to address it. That’s exactly what I will do as president.  https://t.co/t7GgpAnrrw
1165413730139693056 2019-08-24 17:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The people of Keene, New Hampshire, know that if we come together and remember who we are as Americans, there’s not a single thing we can’t do. Thank you to everyone who joined us this afternoon!  https://t.co/9AbgaeTiKO
1165398630548852738 2019-08-24 16:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m proud to stand in solidarity with @CWAUnion workers who walked off the job last night. @ATT must respect workers' rights, negotiate in good faith, and work to secure a fair contract.
1165387558018142208 2019-08-24 15:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Had the opportunity to say hello to a few of the folks who couldn’t make it inside our Health Care Town Hall yesterday at Dartmouth College. I’ll make sure we get a bigger room next time!  https://t.co/eyt9pte9qk
1165361133370236930 2019-08-24 13:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This election is not a joke.  https://t.co/nkIg4eCpkK
1165339994283753473 2019-08-24 12:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to remember who we are — this is the United States of America. There is not a single thing we cannot do if we do it together.  https://t.co/ALa3yqf2GD
1165314073375825920 2019-08-24 10:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Es hora de recordar quiénes somos. Somos estadounidenses: nos tratamos con dignidad, no dejamos a nadie atrás y no le damos cabida al odio.
1165310801923596289 2019-08-24 10:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s time to remember who we are. We are Americans: We treat each other with dignity, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor.
1165092362441216001 2019-08-23 19:44:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> New Hampshire really is God’s country. Thank you for a great evening, Croydon!  https://t.co/eJMBivruMb
1165082799335829506 2019-08-23 19:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I had a great time talking with folks this week in Urbandale, Iowa. We’re in a battle for the soul of this nation, and coming together with our friends and neighbors is how we’re going to win this election.  https://t.co/pdxTGKCQTk
1165078341516431360 2019-08-23 18:48:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> The U.S. stood with the Baltic States during the Soviet occupation—their flags always flew in D.C., affirming America's defense of democratic values. Today, we must stand with the people of Hong Kong &amp; ensure the U.S. remains a beacon of hope to people around the world.
1165078340669235201 2019-08-23 18:48:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> 30 years ago, 2 million people joined hands to form the Baltic Way—a chain of human determination that reached across Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in defiance of Soviet oppression. It was—and remains—a powerful demonstration of the irrepressible desire for freedom.
1165078339973001216 2019-08-23 18:48:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, demonstrators in Hong Kong, inspired by the iconic Baltic Way protest, formed a human chain to demand China live up to its promises to the people of Hong Kong. They once more showed the world the common yearning for liberty that unites us all.
1165056031858278400 2019-08-23 17:19:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> It was great to be back with folks at Dartmouth College today for our Health Care Town Hall.  Health care is one of the biggest issues in this election. A Biden administration will ensure health care is a right not a privilege—and give everyone the peace of mind they deserve.  https://t.co/rwb70mBHgM
1165027183259078656 2019-08-23 15:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A man whose erratic tweets send markets spiraling downward should not be sitting in the Oval Office.  https://t.co/8UHEaYlAtI
1165021143360782338 2019-08-23 15:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@SethMoulton brought a vital voice to this primary, advocating for the urgent need to undo President Trump’s damage abroad and restore American leadership on the world stage. His passion for and knowledge of American foreign policy are impressive and needed in Congress.
1164992935617794055 2019-08-23 13:08:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> In America, every worker deserves fair treatment, safe workplaces, and the right to join a union. Period. The @NABTU leaders I spoke with in Concord take up that fight for all of us every day.   Thank you @IBEW Local 490 for hosting us!  https://t.co/V27ls50iAF
1164949924167000064 2019-08-23 10:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump continues to chip away at the progress made by the Obama-Biden Administration. This time, he’s going after the rules we put in place to decrease vehicle emissions. It's backwards.   We need a president who believes in climate change.  https://t.co/9P60x0HEwV
1164921486785830913 2019-08-23 08:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Everything workers have that define what it means to live a good life—the 40-hour workweek, paid leave, health care protections, a voice in your workplace safety.   It’s all because of unions. It’s time we recognize that.  https://t.co/bn4AKmIxu4
1164704053907136513 2019-08-22 18:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need to take action now to address our climate crisis.  That starts with beating Donald Trump.
1164678133120950274 2019-08-22 16:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump just doesn't get it — he claimed his tax cuts jolted the economy and spurred hiring. He was wrong.  I’ll reverse his giveaway to the super-wealthy and invest in rebuilding America's middle class instead.  https://t.co/t5BGWhgIim
1164654729387020289 2019-08-22 14:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> New Hampshire, I’m heading your way to talk about our bold vision for the future of the country and how we’ll get it done — together. Head to  https://t.co/V0S140bw5w to find an event in your community.
1164636069989691392 2019-08-22 13:30:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> On Black Women's Equal Pay Day, we must recognize the cumulative discrimination black women face due to both their gender and color of their skin and renew our efforts to close the gender pay gap. When I say we have to rebuild the middle class—that means everyone comes along.
1164625788085387264 2019-08-22 12:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Building a more inclusive middle class is at the heart of this presidential campaign. That's why I support @Culinary226 and the Station Casino workers who voted to unionize. The will of the workers must be respected and management has to come to the negotiating table immediately.
1164585019513298944 2019-08-22 10:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Eleven years ago, I received a phone call from President Obama asking me to be his vice president. The decision to join him and serve this country was the greatest honor of my life.  https://t.co/qNCZfA0Ysx
1164576714938171392 2019-08-22 09:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Firefighters face danger every day to protect our communities—we must be there for them in their time of need. Our thoughts are with the families of Justin and Brian as the search continues—and we thank those working tirelessly to bring their brothers home.
1164551398203244544 2019-08-22 07:54:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> A Democratic president will need a Democratic Senate in 2021 to reverse the damage that @realDonaldTrump has done to this country. Coloradans are fortunate to have @Hickenlooper in the race and continuing the fight.
1164369400331415557 2019-08-21 19:51:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@JayInslee brought an important voice to this race, arguing powerfully that climate change damages our health, national security &amp; economy. The people of Washington are fortunate to have a Governor who fights to make their lives better now &amp; to protect our planet for the future.
1164353127732170752 2019-08-21 18:46:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> On day one, I will eliminate President Trump’s decision to limit asylum and undo his executive orders that eliminated Obama-Biden enforcement priorities on national security and public safety.
1164352898681200640 2019-08-21 18:45:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> It is cruel and abhorrent to strip migrant children of the few protections they have. It's not enough this administration puts children in cages without soap and beds, now it wants to keep them there indefinitely. This isn't who we are.
1164335122914500608 2019-08-21 17:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The super-wealthy don’t need another tax cut. Period.  https://t.co/oS4yaBHwGw
1164320023386525697 2019-08-21 16:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, I was glad to be back amongst friends at the @IowaAFLCIO convention. These folks are the ones who built the middle class, and we’re going to rebuild it together.  https://t.co/uKMoLaYqGT
1164304557532438529 2019-08-21 15:33:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hope you had a great first day of school, @DrBiden! Your students are incredibly lucky to have you as their professor. I can’t wait to hear how the day went.
1164255850426355712 2019-08-21 12:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> “Because he had learned about bullies first hand, he developed a deep sense of compassion and empathy for their targets, along with a lifelong commitment to stopping them.”  My sister Valerie is my best friend. Read her full post here:  https://t.co/Oq9wlchxID
1164194446193205248 2019-08-21 08:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden Administration — just like he inherited everything in his life.  Now, he’s in the process of squandering it.  https://t.co/A6IXfVSFRx
1164159968641110018 2019-08-21 05:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Once again, President Trump has folded to the @NRA and broken his promise to pursue the most modest of gun safety policies.  I give you my word as a Biden: I won’t rest until we pass universal background checks and ban assault weapons. We will end our gun violence epidemic.  https://t.co/4Q6xFrCY29
1164013840578883585 2019-08-20 20:18:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mr. President, these comments are insulting and inexcusable—just like your previous dual loyalty insinuations. Stop dividing Americans and disparaging your fellow citizens. It may not be beneath you, but it is beneath the office you hold.
1163999659599306752 2019-08-20 19:21:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s good to be back in Iowa! We kicked off our trip by discussing our bold vision for the future with some great folks in Warren County and Urbandale. Thank you to everyone who came out.  https://t.co/7wOH3BBYG3
1163984562717896706 2019-08-20 18:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Trump Administration has argued that migrant children held in detention centers don’t need soap, toothbrushes, or beds. Now they’re refusing to provide flu vaccines after three children have already passed away in part from the flu.  It is inhumane.  https://t.co/d34DtefyHL
1163884655235469323 2019-08-20 11:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our teachers and firefighters should not pay a higher tax rate than Wall Street CEOs. That’s why I’ll repeal President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy and close capital gains loopholes.  It’s time we reward work, not just wealth.
1163829541757997056 2019-08-20 08:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We all know in our bones that this election is different. The stakes are higher. The threat is more serious. We have to beat Donald Trump.  That’s the message we lay out in our first TV ad hitting the airwaves today. Watch it below:  https://t.co/5y3l3qXNSg
1163607578804273152 2019-08-19 17:24:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We will make Donald Trump a one-term president.
1163595012443168768 2019-08-19 16:34:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Trump Administration’s Title X rule is a direct attack on Planned Parenthood and the crucial services the organization provides. Access to health care could be taken away from millions of women. It’s wrong, and as president I will reverse it.
1163575870394646528 2019-08-19 15:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Extremism is on the rise in America, fueled by a president who has fanned the flames of division and emboldened white nationalists and Neo-Nazis with messages of support.  This is a battle for the soul of our nation, and it's on all of us to act.  https://t.co/UNQI2FX69Z
1163476968840601601 2019-08-19 08:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s past time for a $15 minimum wage and a real pathway to the middle class, because no one in America should work 40 hours a week and live below the poverty level. No one.  https://t.co/KCiHIRsYSH
1163247707500105731 2019-08-18 17:34:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 99 years ago today, the 19th Amendment was ratified—enshrining in our Constitution that the right to vote cannot be denied based upon sex.  Today, access to the ballot box is still out of reach for too many Americans—it’s up to every single one of us to break down the barriers.
1163223322668228608 2019-08-18 15:57:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> Back in 2007, I had the opportunity to meet with Katie and talk with her about how to overcome a learning disability. Her story has stuck with me ever since. I'm glad we were able to catch up in Iowa, and I'm so proud to hear she has graduated from school.
1163203415549157376 2019-08-18 14:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The truth is Obamacare was, and is, a big deal. It covered 20 million additional Americans and protects over 100 million people with pre-existing conditions.  We can’t afford to tear it down. We should protect and build on it:  https://t.co/IwFG48ED9h  https://t.co/P6IWphrtSt
1163164912291655680 2019-08-18 12:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Two-thirds of Americans agree that we should ban assault weapons. As president, I will take on the @NRA and get it done.  https://t.co/qNMAkngPQc
1163132196367953921 2019-08-18 09:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Trump Administration is trying to eliminate protections for LGBTQ workers that President Obama and I put in place. It’s wrong.  As president, I’ll ensure every American is treated with dignity and respect—regardless of who they are or who they love.  https://t.co/Ubiy2kIKag
1162850339193675776 2019-08-17 15:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We cannot afford four more years of a president who ignores the disastrous effects of climate change. My plan for a Clean Energy Revolution &amp; Environmental Justice will address the climate emergency &amp; protect our communities for generations to come.
1162822656703393792 2019-08-17 13:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My plan to protect and build on Obamacare will not only provide coverage for uninsured Americans, but it will also make health care more affordable for those who already have coverage.
1162788431543590912 2019-08-17 11:09:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A new school year is here—we must recognize those working to prepare our students to succeed in tomorrow’s economy: educators.  As President, I will ensure our educators are supported with the pay and dignity they deserve. Read my plan here:  https://t.co/d1o4WnDczV  https://t.co/hEYMMjh0bF
1162761755409485824 2019-08-17 09:23:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every single community should have access to clean, safe drinking water.   https://t.co/KTFCroTHIy
1162735079967215617 2019-08-17 07:37:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s be clear: racism and hate have no safe harbor in America. We are stronger because of our diversity—not in spite of it.
1162489209883545600 2019-08-16 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump has lied to Iowa farmers at every turn. He promised to ‘unleash ethanol’ but instead all he’s done is secretly unleash Big Oil from its renewable fuel obligations.  I'll support our farmers—not sell them out to the highest bidder.  https://t.co/eTKRnOFjhr
1162452719161921538 2019-08-16 12:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day President Trump proves how morally unfit he is to sit in the Oval Office. A president should bring out our best as Americans — not echo schoolyard bullies with taunts based on physical appearance.  https://t.co/TKfog6NMNz
1162438881192509440 2019-08-16 12:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> I look forward to joining @GiffordsCourage and @AMarch4OurLives at their forum to discuss how we can take on the @NRA and end our gun violence epidemic. Together, we will get it done.
1162433845158957056 2019-08-16 11:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It was great meeting our previous contest winners, Kellie and her wife Amanda, after last month’s Democratic debate.  Enter now for your chance to join us for the next debate in Houston:  https://t.co/hgKmqF00yn  https://t.co/BK6mCgFjkR
1162403394272673794 2019-08-16 09:39:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. If we want to win, it’s going to take everyone stepping up, speaking out, and taking action.  Text JOIN to 30330 and let’s get to work.  https://t.co/zMdN7OeK0h
1162173881794215937 2019-08-15 18:27:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A Biden administration will ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We will get these military-style weapons off our streets.
1162144941293920256 2019-08-15 16:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Coal miners have powered our country from the Industrial Revolution to the 21st century. I'm proud to stand with the protesting miners. Blackjewel has an obligation to give its workers the pay and benefits they’ve earned.  https://t.co/juuDvLWnKZ
1162096874607828997 2019-08-15 13:21:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Since 1978, CEO compensation has risen 940%, while the average American has seen a raise of just 12%. It’s wrong. We need a $15 minimum wage, stronger labor laws, and a tax code that works for the middle class.  It’s time we reward work, not just wealth.  https://t.co/E1rJPpGdsy
1162081523706867712 2019-08-15 12:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Gov. @Hickenlooper ran a strong campaign, talking about the urgent need to rebuild our middle class and standing up to President Trump's trade wars. Coloradans are lucky to have John in their corner, and I look forward to seeing what he does next.
1162074225265512448 2019-08-15 11:51:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I have always been a stalwart supporter of Israel—a vital partner that shares our democratic values. No democracy should deny entry to visitors based on the content of their ideas—even ideas they strongly object to. And no leader of the free world should encourage them to do so.
1161985898155692032 2019-08-15 06:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Before I was Vice President, before I was a Senator — I started my career as an elected official on the New Castle County Council. Local races matter. I'm proud to sign the @runforsomething pledge to support candidates up and down the ballot to invest in our party’s future.
1161800996126937088 2019-08-14 17:45:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> Rep. Steve King should resign. His comments on rape and incest have no place in Congress and fuel a corrosive culture in this country around sexual assault.  We deserve better from our elected officials.
1161791018758541313 2019-08-14 17:05:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@DrBiden and I send our prayers to the police officers injured today in Philadelphia, and to their families who wake up every day knowing that their loved ones are walking into harm's way when they put on the badge. We're grateful for the selfless work they do to keep us safe.
1161723369366142981 2019-08-14 12:36:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> America is an idea. An idea that for centuries has offered hope to the tired, the poor, and the huddled masses yearning to breathe free.   We won’t let Donald Trump and his administration change that.
1161643638134149121 2019-08-14 07:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Whether you are online, at a gun show, or in a store — you should have to pass a background check to buy a gun. Period.  https://t.co/npb6VFvwlu
1161435265153417216 2019-08-13 17:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump has emboldened white nationalists with messages of support, called Mexicans "rapists," and told members of Congress to "go back" to where they came from.  The words of a president matter. And Trump has used his to unleash the deepest, darkest forces in our nation.
1161405631728934912 2019-08-13 15:34:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is America, and we are strong and great because of our diversity — not in spite of it. Donald Trump doesn’t get that.  Prioritizing wealthy immigrants while punishing working-class ones betrays the American idea that everyone gets a fair shot — regardless of background.
1161382094754521089 2019-08-13 14:00:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know what it takes to beat the @NRA because I’ve done it twice before. In the Senate, @SenFeinstein and I took on the gun lobby to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and helped pass the Brady background check bill.  As president, I’ll beat them once again.
1161364800565215232 2019-08-13 12:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The brave protestors in Hong Kong are demanding the rights and freedoms promised to them. The U.S. should be leading the free world to rally support behind them and, with one voice, defend our shared democratic ideals and the desire for liberty that beats in every heart.
1161334098377334784 2019-08-13 10:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s unacceptable that children learn to fear mass shooters alongside their ABCs.  It's unacceptable that people feel unsafe on their weekly grocery run.  It's unacceptable that living in fear of gun violence has become our new normal.
1161073632262705157 2019-08-12 17:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Don’t tell Champ and Major.  https://t.co/ld8ZdYTKQC
1161062558922629120 2019-08-12 16:51:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The vast majority of Americans want common-sense gun safety reform. We need leaders with the backbone to stand up to the @NRA and get it done.  https://t.co/h65U60V8Rx
1161020156367314945 2019-08-12 14:02:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> For decades, the Endangered Species Act has protected our most vulnerable wildlife from extinction. Now, President Trump wants to throw it all away.   At a time when climate change is pushing our planet to the brink, we should strengthen protections — not weaken them.
1161008452443004931 2019-08-12 13:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we cannot rise to meet this moment, it won’t just be a political failure. It will be a moral one. It will mean that we accept the next inevitable tragedy.  We cannot allow that to happen. We must end our gun violence epidemic.  https://t.co/LmiZkk2NDT
1160981776715538432 2019-08-12 11:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There used to be a basic bargain in this country that when you worked hard, you were able to share in the prosperity you helped create.  That bargain is broken for American workers, and it's time we restore it.  https://t.co/1X8OtXQ3lb
1160900220756156417 2019-08-12 06:05:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> Two years after Charlottesville, we have a problem with this rising tide of white supremacy in America. And we have a president who encourages and emboldens it. But if we stand together in opposing it, we will win the battle for the soul of this nation.  https://t.co/7X6nSZMyQT
1160722820411940864 2019-08-11 18:21:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I will do everything in my power to stop America’s gun violence epidemic by passing common-sense gun reform. Lives depend on it.  https://t.co/1oGyLME1fk
1160712002827952133 2019-08-11 17:38:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@DrBiden and I wish everyone celebrating #EidAlAdha hope, faith, and joy. Eid Mubarak!
1160688865650364416 2019-08-11 16:06:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the Senate, @SenFeinstein and I led the successful effort to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. It worked. It saved lives.  As president, I’ll take on the @NRA and ban military-style weapons once again.  https://t.co/bPPJXCdQWt
1160660409348608001 2019-08-11 14:13:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need universal background checks for gun sales. Period.   I’ve beaten the @NRA twice, and I’ll do it again as president. It’s time for a leader who stands up to the powerful gun lobby.  https://t.co/Yp35AQoLaS
1160631216904687617 2019-08-11 12:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The words of a president matter. Hateful rhetoric and white nationalism have no place in our nation.   https://t.co/BaBW0SvB5c
1160378048723791872 2019-08-10 19:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to @Everytown and @MomsDemand for hosting today’s #GunSenseForum.  As I said this afternoon, spread the faith. Talk with friends and neighbors about what's happening in America. Demand change. Because together, we can and will end our gun violence epidemic.  https://t.co/rqAgETgQsw
1160301544622833664 2019-08-10 14:27:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Assault weapons don’t belong in our communities. Period. As president, I’ll ban these military-style weapons and institute a buyback program that gets as many as possible off our streets.  https://t.co/25ie9qBiSC
1160285941946290177 2019-08-10 13:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> July was the hottest month on Earth ever recorded — making it clearer than ever that climate change is already here and requires our urgent, drastic action.  On day one, I’ll take the bold action necessary to tackle this crisis head-on.  https://t.co/QLfgtL32Y6
1160266060819361792 2019-08-10 12:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Now is not the time to cower in the face of the @NRA, now is the time to stand up with courage and conviction and pass gun safety legislation. Lives depend on it.
1160258511013588994 2019-08-10 11:36:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There’s no better place than the Iowa State Fair to meet some new folks and stop for ice cream. Thank you to everyone who said hello!  https://t.co/8kllm7Y3P7
1160233093560770561 2019-08-10 09:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. But I know — with passionate folks like those at last night’s @iowawingding — we will win.  https://t.co/UZZR6qv8kd
1160022455517208576 2019-08-09 19:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Grateful for the hard work these folks put in every day on the ground in Iowa. #WingDing  https://t.co/8jw98yBbCB
1159992256436330501 2019-08-09 17:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need gun safety reform &amp; leaders who will step up to get it done. Gov. Sununu instead has decided to stand with President Trump in putting the gun lobby over common-sense reforms that will keep Granite Staters safe.  As president, I’ll take on the NRA &amp; win—again. #NHPolitics
1159967594226393089 2019-08-09 16:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Five years ago, Michael Brown's life was taken in Ferguson. His death stirred the conscience of our nation and awakened a generation of activists. We must ensure justice rings out for all in America — regardless of skin color.
1159867182378913792 2019-08-09 09:41:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> At moments when we have been tested most, American presidents have stepped up.  We don’t have that today. We have a president who has aligned himself with the darkest forces in this nation. And that makes winning the battle for the soul of this nation that much harder.  https://t.co/7BFSGSUkCu
1159848811256254464 2019-08-09 08:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines don’t belong on our streets.
1159655034642153473 2019-08-08 19:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@DrBiden and I had a great afternoon at the Iowa State Fair where we talked with folks about our bold vision for the country. I stopped for some ice cream, too.  https://t.co/khHEdnMTOh
1159602689640226817 2019-08-08 16:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the Senate, I successfully took on the @NRA to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines — and helped pass the Brady background check bill. As president, I’ll do it again.  Add your name to stand with me:  https://t.co/o8CBlezjAd  https://t.co/VG2NjjTnKr
1159582945293869057 2019-08-08 14:51:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> Guilty as charged
1159563172799569927 2019-08-08 13:32:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is who Donald Trump is: a president determined to terrorize immigrant communities and rip apart families — at the border and across our country.  The question is, who are we? I believe we are a nation that will end these cruel policies and make Trump a one-term president.
1159483152584384514 2019-08-08 08:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Along with Senator Feinstein, I got assault weapons and high-capacity magazines banned in this country for ten years. As president, I’ll make sure they’re banned once again.  https://t.co/2NrD4JIRT3
1159286969693802496 2019-08-07 19:15:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> On a day when President Trump is supposed to be embracing a grieving community and celebrating our American diversity in El Paso, his administration is instead stoking fear by conducting massive immigration raids in Mississippi.  He is morally unfit to lead this country.
1159275282483810305 2019-08-07 18:29:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The @NRA doesn’t own this country. We the people own this country.
1159264209265315840 2019-08-07 17:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In both clear language and in code, President Trump has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation.  https://t.co/UoiiMVrCW7
1159228212465025025 2019-08-07 15:21:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. It’s why I’m running for president.  https://t.co/XgVOF7Xt8q
1159209632600154113 2019-08-07 14:08:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are almost 330 million Americans who have to do what our president can’t. Stand together. Stand against hate. Stand up for what—at our best—this nation believes.  https://t.co/Sj4Zio4Zbd
1159201340167507974 2019-08-07 13:35:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are almost 330 million Americans who have to do what our president can’t. Stand together. Stand against hate. Stand up for what—at our best—this nation believes.  If we stand together, we will win the battle for the soul of this nation.
1159200630373851138 2019-08-07 13:32:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> So it’s up to us. We’re living through a rare moment in this nation’s history. Where our president isn’t up to the moment. Where our president lacks the moral authority to lead. Where our president has more in common with George Wallace than George Washington.
1159199877005533185 2019-08-07 13:29:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump offers no moral leadership, no interest in unifying the nation, and no evidence the presidency has awakened his conscience in the least.  Instead, we have a president with a toxic tongue who has unapologetically embraced a political strategy of hate, racism, and division.
1159198686431371265 2019-08-07 13:24:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> At moments when we have been tested most, American presidents have stepped up. They led, opposed hate, and chose to fight for the best of the American character.  We don’t have that today. Our president has aligned himself with the darkest forces in this nation.
1159195736757682176 2019-08-07 13:12:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character. At our best, the American ideal wins out. But it’s never a rout. It’s always a fight. And the battle is never finished.
1159194842355949569 2019-08-07 13:09:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> I wish I could say this hate began with Trump and will end with him. It didn’t &amp; it won’t.  The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push-and-pull between the American ideal that we are all created equal &amp; the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.
1159194213684252680 2019-08-07 13:06:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> In both clear language and in code, this president has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation.
1159193999481167873 2019-08-07 13:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> How far is it from the white supremacists and Neo-Nazis in Charlottesville – Trump’s “very fine people” – chanting “You will not replace us” to the shooter at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh saying Jews “were committing genocide to his people.”  Not far at all.
1159191486682075138 2019-08-07 12:56:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> How far is it from Trump’s saying this “is an invasion” to the shooter in El Paso declaring “this attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas”?  Not far at all.
1159190776724840455 2019-08-07 12:53:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> I said at the time that we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. I said it again when I announced. It’s why I’m running for president.
1159189377123323907 2019-08-07 12:47:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> When he said after Charlottesville that there were “very fine people on both sides” he gave license and safe harbor for hate to white supremacists, Neo-Nazis, and the KKK.  Those words stunned the nation and shocked the world.
1159188880983240710 2019-08-07 12:45:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> The words of a president matter. They can move markets. They can send our brave men and women to war. They can bring peace.  And they can unleash the deepest, darkest forces in this nation — like Donald Trump has chosen to do.

1159161029374308352 2019-08-07 10:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A president is supposed to unite our nation and lift us up. Not prey on our divisions and tear us down.  https://t.co/qde3e7Y9wX
1159115731167932421 2019-08-07 07:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Yesterday, @DrBiden and I had the opportunity to thank a few firefighters for their dedication to keeping Idaho safe.  I’ve witnessed the heroism of first responders—they rush into the face of danger every single day to save complete strangers. They are the best of America.  https://t.co/BZGCgzEL6P
1158922457350172672 2019-08-06 19:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Toni Morrison had an incredible ability to translate the everyday experience of African Americans into written word. Her writing had the power to open minds, shift political discourse, and shape the views of generations. She will be sorely missed.  https://t.co/lj8M2y1zwR
1158900238473748482 2019-08-06 17:38:42 -0800 <JoeBiden> Fred, your strength and resilience in the face of unspeakable tragedy continues to inspire me and so many others. I carry Jaime’s memory with me every day as we continue our efforts to end America’s gun violence epidemic.
1158881605005565955 2019-08-06 16:24:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> But our job is not done. The #VotingRightsAct has been gutted by the Supreme Court &amp; voting rights are under siege across the country.  As president, I will restore the VRA, stand up to attacks on the right to vote, &amp; renew our efforts to ensure every American’s voice is equal.
1158880882297643008 2019-08-06 16:21:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> The fight for civil rights is one of the things that got me engaged in politics. And when I was ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, we successfully extended the #VotingRightsAct for 25 years.
1158880179126751232 2019-08-06 16:19:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 54 years ago, the #VotingRightsAct brought our nation closer to living up to our founding ideals of equality, equity, and fairness for all.  https://t.co/JsFPLhBYHO
1158841926663041024 2019-08-06 13:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t fix a problem if we refuse to name the problem. This is white nationalism. This is white supremacy. This is about hate.  Mr. President, it’s long past time you stood up to it.  https://t.co/EI0YakZYlA
1158814496418357248 2019-08-06 11:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thoughts and prayers won’t solve our broken gun laws. We need politicians with the courage to stand up to the powerful gun lobby and tell them that they don’t own this country.  I’ve beaten the @NRA twice, and I’ll do it again in the White House.
1158584976964816899 2019-08-05 20:45:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> Honesty, decency, hope, leaving nobody behind, giving hate no safe harbor. That’s who we are. But I don't see much of that coming from this administration.  https://t.co/fkRcGfJgXW
1158492876747051008 2019-08-05 14:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As we watched in horror at the events in El Paso and Dayton, Chicago suffered its most violent weekend of 2019.  We cannot go on like this. We must muster up the courage to take on the @NRA, pass common-sense reform, and end our gun violence epidemic.   https://t.co/0eUEzzUCQJ
1158410845854081025 2019-08-05 09:14:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let's be very clear. You use the office of the presidency to encourage and embolden white supremacy. You use words like "infestation" and "invasion" to talk about human beings. We won't truly speak with one voice against hatred until your voice is no longer in the White House.
1158394637989621760 2019-08-05 08:09:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mr. President, immigration isn’t the problem. White nationalism is the problem. America’s inaction on gun safety legislation is the problem.  It’s time to put the politics aside and pass universal background checks and an assault weapons ban. Lives depend on it.
1158169495921418241 2019-08-04 17:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Enough is enough. As a nation, we need to take common-sense steps to end this epidemic of gun violence.  @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell should reconvene the Senate and pass the House’s universal background check bill. We cannot wait to take action.  https://t.co/0OLqH0xxcl
1158151124991401985 2019-08-04 16:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t fix a problem if we refuse to name it: white nationalism. An ideology emboldened by a president who stokes the flames of hatred and coddles white supremacists with messages of support.  We must do what Trump won't: condemn this evil and eradicate it from our society.
1158063148928315392 2019-08-04 10:12:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. And in this moment, we all have a responsibility to declare with conviction that hatred and bigotry and white supremacy have no place in America. We will give hate no safe harbor.
1158063148093587458 2019-08-04 10:12:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to address what’s happening in America. We continue to bear witness to acts of terror carried out with a common thread: hatred of “the other.” We saw it in Charlottesville two years ago, at synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway, and now in El Paso.
1158063147334475776 2019-08-04 10:12:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines don’t belong on our streets. We must stand up to the @NRA and gun manufacturers—they don’t own this country. We the people own this country.
1158063146239528961 2019-08-04 10:12:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> At least 29 lives stolen, families broken, communities shattered in El Paso and Dayton within 13 hours. Dozens more wounded. Between those two mass shootings, dozens more were killed and injured by gun violence that didn't make national headlines.
1157763319429656577 2019-08-03 14:21:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Heartbroken to hear the news from El Paso. Our thoughts are with those impacted by yet another senseless act of gun violence in America.  How many lives must be cut short? How many communities must be torn apart? It’s past time we take action and end our gun violence epidemic.
1157693487976013824 2019-08-03 09:43:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s clear that climate change is already here. Today. And we need to take urgent action to address it.  That starts with beating Donald Trump.
1157397408533360645 2019-08-02 14:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the last three years, President Trump has turned our world upside down internationally and economically. People are hurting. The soul of our country is collapsing because of his presidency.  We have to be honest, straight forward, and authentic about what we will do to fix it.
1157340342951321600 2019-08-02 10:20:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> America must defend the values that unite us—we must lead the Free World.   As president, I will remind the world who we are. The United States does not coddle dictators. The United States stands up for democracy.
1157340341634306048 2019-08-02 10:20:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is echoing his authoritarian heroes, again—this time using China's anti-democracy talking points to describe the peaceful protests in Hong Kong as "riots." It's shameful.  When people suffering under oppression look to the U.S. for hope, Trump has nothing to offer.
1157326440905371648 2019-08-02 09:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Yet more proof that Trump doesn’t care about the farmers, workers, and consumers that are being crushed by his irresponsible tariff war with China. It’s easy to act tough when someone else is feeling the pain.  I will reverse his senseless policies.  https://t.co/8XrVcUjUB5
1157307314832998405 2019-08-02 08:09:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> There is nothing moderate about what President Obama did with Obamacare. Nothing. Seven presidents tried to expand access to health care — the Obama-Biden Administration finally got it done.  https://t.co/awe0f8r0H7
1157098941906898945 2019-08-01 18:21:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I was surprised at all of the attacks on President Obama's record at the #DemDebate. The Obama-Biden Administration passed Obamacare, lead the world on combating climate change, and saved our economy from the brink of disaster.  He was a great president. We don’t say that enough.
1157068491184209922 2019-08-01 16:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are a nation of immigrants — that’s why we’re so special. #DemDebate  https://t.co/IvM8DOOuzq
1157050875233361920 2019-08-01 15:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The U.S. has a responsibility to extend Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans fleeing desperate circumstances—violence, oppression, starvation. The House passed a bipartisan bill to take action, now @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell must bring it up for a vote. #TPS4VZ
1157042067320836097 2019-08-01 14:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Wrapped up our time in Detroit with a quick stop at Coney Island Restaurant for some lunch and great conversation with community members.  https://t.co/ZRxoCsTP5Q
1157004318546919424 2019-08-01 12:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The criticism of Obamacare is a bunch of malarkey. #DemDebate  https://t.co/dS6LDmTBOH
1156988464031645696 2019-08-01 11:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The ACLU says that the Trump Administration has continued to rip children from their parents, even after courts ordered them to stop. It’s inhumane &amp; goes against everything we stand for as a nation of immigrants &amp; values.  I’ll end these cruel policies.  https://t.co/LLbO0zp4H2
1156867416338632704 2019-08-01 03:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Last night on the debate stage, I shared my bold vision for the future of our country. Everyone knows who Donald Trump is. Let’s show them who we are.  There’s nothing we can’t do — together. #DemDebate  https://t.co/gA2dYbUD05
1156791386227781632 2019-07-31 21:58:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mr. President — this is America. We are strong and great because of our diversity. #DemDebate  https://t.co/XjveDSBJ0T
1156780622318321664 2019-07-31 21:16:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. We have to let them know who we are.  We choose science over fiction, hope over fear, and unity over division. #DemDebate  https://t.co/6sX9jZ1GGr
1156759796382601219 2019-07-31 19:53:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> I just got off the stage where I shared my bold vision for our future built on uniting our country. Because I know if we work together, there’s nothing we can’t do.  Let's keep our momentum going. If you liked what you heard tonight, text JOE to 30330 and let's get to work.  https://t.co/EDIKTYiJB1
1156759192587448320 2019-07-31 19:50:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> That’s all we have for tonight’s #DemDebate—thanks for tuning in! Make sure to follow @TeamJoe to keep up-to-date with everything happening on our campaign.
1156758710733221889 2019-07-31 19:49:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> Debate Night #2 is in the books.  #DemDebate  https://t.co/swo54INprG
1156752567306731520 2019-07-31 19:24:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can protect our interests in Afghanistan, including the possibility of a terrorist threat re-emerging, without a large troop presence. That is what Joe Biden will do as president.  https://t.co/5viTYUtn3l
1156752566551797760 2019-07-31 19:24:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe Biden has long believed that the US should narrow rather than broaden its military efforts in Afghanistan, and has for years advocated for ending the war responsibly. We can't keep spending tens of billions of dollars a year to sustain a stalemate. #DemDebate
1156750510822711297 2019-07-31 19:16:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe Biden believes that women have a constitutional right to choose. Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, and Biden will work to codify it. He’ll continue to fight for a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions with her doctor. #DemDebate
1156750121197084678 2019-07-31 19:14:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> Finally, Joe Biden has been integral to some of the biggest child care tax credit wins in our history, including in the Recovery Act and the fiscal cliff deal.  And as president, he'll expand the child care tax credit to up to $8,000 per family. #DemDebate
1156750120450441216 2019-07-31 19:14:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here's the truth about Joe Biden's vote:  He wasn't opposed to the child care tax credit itself. He was opposed to this specific tax credit being made available to affluent people.
1156750119750045697 2019-07-31 19:14:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> This attack from Senator Gillibrand has been two weeks in the making, and it STILL isn’t accurate. Let's set the record straight:
1156748884368080896 2019-07-31 19:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Vice President Biden has fought for women's rights his whole career:  ✓Wrote the Violence Against Women Act ✓Co-sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment 9 times ✓Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act: 1st Obama-Biden bill signed into law  ✓Co-sponsored the Pregnancy Discrimination Act
1156748016759595008 2019-07-31 19:06:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> When it comes to trade, either we're going to write the rules of the road for the world or China is—and not in a way that advances our values.   Meanwhile, this administration has launched trade wars against the very allies we need with us to change China’s behavior. #DemDebate
1156745859658375173 2019-07-31 18:57:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> Biden will stand up to the abuse of power by polluters who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities. He’ll work to ensure that communities across the country from Flint, MI to Harlan, KY to the NH Seacoast have access to clean, safe drinking water.
1156744771798536192 2019-07-31 18:53:39 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe Biden has received more than 100 endorsements from community leaders around the country, including Detroit's own @MayorMikeDuggan. #DemDebate  https://t.co/Bx0KDDtziE
1156744362216304640 2019-07-31 18:52:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> In 2009, the Obama-Biden administration made a big bet on rescuing the US auto industry. It paid off:  -More than 646,000 auto jobs -Auto production doubled in the US -Auto sales hit an all-time high  Detroit was on the front lines of that recovery. #DemDebate
1156742176249929728 2019-07-31 18:43:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> Climate change requires drastic action.  Joe Biden has a comprehensive plan to tackle our climate emergency and environmental injustices head on:  https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo  #DemDebate  https://t.co/g5dKbboPTV
1156741582269403136 2019-07-31 18:40:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> Climate change poses an existential threat to our health, our communities, our national security, and our economic well-being.   As president, Biden will rally the world to address the climate emergency and lead through the power of example. #DemDebate  https://t.co/q4HYwiqewK
1156739855608627200 2019-07-31 18:34:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Two Delaware civil rights champions on the Joe Biden they know, and why they're proud to stand by him and call him a friend:  https://t.co/srdrKCA7Me
1156737086147497989 2019-07-31 18:23:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we want to talk about the Crime Bill, let's hear from the President who chose @JoeBiden as his running mate—twice.  https://t.co/C3w9zpjrlS
1156736547552681986 2019-07-31 18:20:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> The 1994 Crime Bill included:   -The ground-breaking Violence Against Women Act -Bans on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines -Funding for drug courts and prevention  #DemDebate
1156736120358670336 2019-07-31 18:19:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe Biden will strengthen America’s commitment to justice and reform by taking action to reduce our prison population, address racial disparities, and make our communities safer. #DemDebate  https://t.co/rVcRMKB3SH
1156734942333820930 2019-07-31 18:14:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe Biden has the boldest, most comprehensive criminal justice reform proposal in this election.   Read the full plan here:  https://t.co/bnXs8KOAwh #DemDebate  https://t.co/0fMd6DujlO
1156734424526053376 2019-07-31 18:12:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> Under Medicare for All, Americans will see a new type of deductible in their paycheck. Medicare for All costs $30 trillion. Not sure what math they do in New York or California but that would be a lot of money.  https://t.co/ifctf8g7pB
1156733779765006336 2019-07-31 18:09:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> Las políticas de inmigración de Trump son un asalto a la dignidad humana. No somos un país que niegue a los niños jabón y cepillo de dientes. Esto no es lo que somos. #DemDebate
1156733705232297985 2019-07-31 18:09:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump's immigration policies are an assault on human dignity. We aren't a country that denies children soap and a toothbrush. This is not who we are. #DemDebate
1156731336687853569 2019-07-31 18:00:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump is the problem with our immigration policy. He's using family separation as a weapon against desperate people seeking safety and a better life.  We need to defeat Donald Trump. #DemDebate
1156729325464539136 2019-07-31 17:52:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s get the facts straight: Medicare for All will cost 30x more than Joe Biden’s health care plan—and it will be paid for by raising taxes on the middle class. #DemDebate  https://t.co/dlyVfenQFg
1156728962560798721 2019-07-31 17:50:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> Because of the Affordable Care Act, 20 million Americans gained health insurance. Millions more gained critical protections. But the work isn’t over. As president, Biden won’t rest until everyone has access to the quality, affordable care they deserve. #DemDebate
1156728498037448704 2019-07-31 17:48:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> As Vice President, Biden was a champion for efforts to implement the federal mental health parity law, improve access to mental health care, and eliminate the stigma.   As president, he'll enforce our mental health parity laws and expand funding for mental health services.
1156727293991161862 2019-07-31 17:44:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> Senator Harris’ Medicare for All plan still gets rid of employer-sponsored coverage and still costs 30x more than Joe Biden’s health care plan. Just changing the start date by 6 years doesn’t change the fact it is bad policy. #DemDebate  https://t.co/CsBtsTevWE
1156726875370217473 2019-07-31 17:42:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m running for president to restore the soul of this country...No one man has the capacity to rip that apart. It’s too strong. We're too good.  https://t.co/qUDRRuY5Rg
1156725378045685762 2019-07-31 17:36:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> In America, health care should be a right for all -- not a privilege for the wealthy few.  Joe Biden’s plan to protect and build on Obamacare is the best way to achieve universal coverage and lower costs:  https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C  https://t.co/jtA88ylrdp
1156724692042047488 2019-07-31 17:33:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> Americans prefer protecting and building on Obamacare with a public option over Medicare for All:  https://t.co/tNlPVLG1v8
1156724141925556224 2019-07-31 17:31:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> Healthcare is the most important issue to Americans. Senator Harris won't be able to beat Trump with double-talk on healthcare. We have a plan that builds on the ACA by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system easier to navigate.
1156723702341472258 2019-07-31 17:29:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> Mr. President, this is America. We're stronger because of this diversity, not in spite of it. #DemDebate
1156716954314575872 2019-07-31 17:03:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Retweet if you’re proud to be on #TeamJoe! #DemDebate  https://t.co/7XZeGxeQsQ
1156716515095404544 2019-07-31 17:01:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hey everyone, @TeamJoe here! We’re taking over for tonight’s #DemDebate to give you the facts about Joe’s record on the issues and vision for our country. Stay tuned!
1156713999825813504 2019-07-31 16:51:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> Now I’m handing the account over to my team before I take the stage. They’ll keep you up-to-date on what’s happening at tonight’s #DemDebate. Make sure to follow along!
1156713998504603648 2019-07-31 16:51:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> We deserve leaders that unite us around our shared goals, rather than prey on our divisions. That’s why I’m running for president. To unite our country and put us on a different path — not back to a past that never was — but to a future that fulfills our true potential.
1156713997611229184 2019-07-31 16:51:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> Detroit — and our country as a whole — is like its people: resilient and tough. Defined by a work ethic that is unmatched by any place in the world. And when given half a fighting chance, there’s nothing the American people can’t do.
1156713996768153602 2019-07-31 16:51:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> As we gather in Detroit, it’s important that we recognize the significance of the Motor City. Because few cities embody the American spirit better than Detroit.  When it was knocked down flat on its back, it didn’t give up. It came roaring back.
1156713995702808577 2019-07-31 16:51:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tonight, I’ll take the stage in Detroit for the second #DemDebate. I’m excited to have the opportunity to discuss the issues on voters’ minds, why I’m running for president, and my bold vision for the future of our country.
1156710604289314816 2019-07-31 16:37:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm getting ready to take the stage in Detroit! Grateful to have my family by my side.  https://t.co/fMe99KYAIK
1156691352983412737 2019-07-31 15:21:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here's the deal, President Trump inherited the economy from the Obama-Biden Administration. And just like everything else he's been given in his life, he's in the process of squandering it.
1156677917469896704 2019-07-31 14:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve got some exciting news: I am now on Snapchat! Subscribe to get a behind-the-scenes look at tonight’s #DemDebate and what’s happening on the campaign trail:  https://t.co/AFamrxf91F  https://t.co/LdYpSDWh9n
1156646963506368512 2019-07-31 12:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> A car accident took the lives of my first wife and baby daughter. My family was fortunate to have health insurance, but that's not the case for many.   This is why I fight. I believe deeply that health care is a right for all—not a privilege for the few.  https://t.co/qsyFHn8jH9
1156374417691369474 2019-07-30 18:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On what would have been his 46th birthday, my thoughts are with the family of my friend Reverend Clementa Pinckney. As we celebrate his life, let's continue on his legacy by living with compassion, kindness, and a relentless dedication to improving the lives of others.  https://t.co/qDFArjl5Gb
1156326700759863296 2019-07-30 15:12:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump &amp; Betsy DeVos continue to roll back our progress on LGBTQ rights. No child should feel unsafe in school because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.  A Biden administration will ensure all of our young people are affirmed &amp; accepted exactly as they are.
1156310866456981504 2019-07-30 14:09:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> My plan builds on that legacy with a new public health insurance option like Medicare. Read the full plan here:  https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C
1156310865324519424 2019-07-30 14:09:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> 54 years ago, President Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law. This landmark legislation changed the lives of millions by providing the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care.
1156286359541354496 2019-07-30 12:32:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m grateful to Joe and Michelle for sharing their story and glad to hear Matthew is receiving the treatment he needs.  Read our full plan to protect and build on the Affordable Care Act to ensure everyone has access to the care they need:  https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C
1156271238471462912 2019-07-30 11:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump has failed on his promises for American workers time and time again. We need to rebuild the middle class, and this time make sure everybody comes along — regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.  https://t.co/Df7rHBCzLp
1156005990061318145 2019-07-29 17:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Two years ago, President Trump gave giant tax cuts to the super-wealthy and corporations. Now, he wants to rip free school lunches away from kids who need help the most. It’s heartless. No kid should go hungry in America.  https://t.co/TybdVnFjLH
1155980069384282112 2019-07-29 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to stop America’s gun violence epidemic — that starts with taking on the powerful gun lobby and passing common-sense gun safety laws.  I’ve beaten the @NRA twice. And I’ll do it again in the White House.
1155969547343556608 2019-07-29 15:33:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Affordable Care Act changed the life of @DrBiden’s sister — like it did millions of Americans — by giving her access to the health care she needed. We can’t afford to start over.  https://t.co/ixdpu8bQGv
1155946347280916480 2019-07-29 14:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@TheRevAl is a champion in the fight for civil rights. The fact that President Trump continues to use the power of the presidency to unleash racist attacks on the people he serves is despicable. This hate has no place in our country. It's beneath the dignity of the office.
1155914818202865665 2019-07-29 11:55:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> Iowa, I have some big news: @DrBiden is heading your way on August 1st to open two of our field offices. Join her in Sioux City:  https://t.co/h1olJlsQuc or Council Bluffs:  https://t.co/1PoR8mdfT2.  https://t.co/79BfOWQrIh
1155866822979178496 2019-07-29 08:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re gathering #TeamJoe in Detroit on July 30th and 31st to show the power of our grassroots movement at the second debate. I hope to see you there! RSVP at   https://t.co/9dh6RvZ9bO.
1155702372338937861 2019-07-28 21:51:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> This violence is not normal. How many more families will have to lose a loved one before we fix our broken gun laws? We must take action, starting with real reform.  Our thoughts are with everyone in Gilroy this evening. Enough is enough.
1155584966186717185 2019-07-28 14:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Instead of starting from scratch, we need to build on the Affordable Care Act. I'll expand on the progress we made—giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system less complex to navigate.  Read my full plan at  https://t.co/gm6jgUINzt
1155573389471305728 2019-07-28 13:19:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Far too often, students who experience mental health problems do not get the care they need. As President, I will double the number of mental health professionals in schools to give our kids the support they deserve.  https://t.co/hHruW4wDtx
1155529097612677121 2019-07-28 10:23:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need to show the power of our grassroots movement. If you’re in the Detroit area, come together with #TeamJoe in your community outside of the second debate on July 30 and 31. RSVP at  https://t.co/9dh6RvZ9bO.
1155499150454095872 2019-07-28 08:24:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congratulations to our @TeamJoe #DemDebate contest winner—Kellie from North Carolina!  Can’t wait to see you at the debate in Detroit on July 31st, Kel!  https://t.co/MmJ4Ye8VqR
1155479682990714880 2019-07-28 07:06:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> I worked hard to pass the Affordable Care Act—it was a milestone for American health care. I will continue to oppose every effort to tear it down. We have come too far to start over. Read my plan to protect and build on Obamacare at  https://t.co/gm6jgUINzt
1155479681954717696 2019-07-28 07:06:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> Since the historic passage of the Affordable Care Act, Congressional Republicans have been fighting to it tear down. Two years ago today, they continued their crusade in an attempt to pass a “skinny repeal” of Obamacare—it failed.
1155193889105600513 2019-07-27 12:11:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump’s trade wars are squeezing American farmers. In states like South Dakota—where agriculture is a top industry—effects go well beyond farms. As president, I'd join together with our allies &amp; stand up to China to ensure our policies work for our farmers. https://t.co/CEm0IRZIg0
1155176535428460545 2019-07-27 11:02:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@RepCummings is one of the finest people I’ve ever served with. It is despicable for you to attack him and the people of Baltimore this way. Once again you have proved yourself unfit to hold the office. A President is supposed to lift this nation up. Not tear it down.
1155166206443212800 2019-07-27 10:21:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here’s the deal: I will oppose every effort by Republicans, Democrats, &amp; anyone else seeking to tear down Obamacare. It is imperative that we build upon the progress we've made by protecting the Affordable Care Act. Read my plan at  https://t.co/IwFG48ED9h   https://t.co/BaLX1VRWZo
1155129767022211074 2019-07-27 07:56:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> A border wall is the physical embodiment of @realDonaldTrump’s inability to develop effective immigration policy.  His use of Department of Defense funds for the wall is a phony answer to the real challenges we face—and he knows it.
1155128457786843136 2019-07-27 07:51:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Climate change is an existential threat to our planet. As President, not only will I recommit us to the Paris Agreement—I’ll lead an effort for every major emitting country to ramp up the ambition of their domestic climate targets.   https://t.co/1aKhXI1FPY
1155102646489047045 2019-07-27 06:08:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I’ll make it a priority to take action against polluters who knowingly harm our environment and poison our communities’ air, land, and water. Read my plan at  https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo
1155102645423616001 2019-07-27 06:08:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can't be blind to the way environmental burdens—like air pollution—are distributed unevenly along racial and socioeconomic lines.  https://t.co/74pGl6etPp
1154919417614147585 2019-07-26 18:00:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, on the Act's anniversary, we must recommit to fully breaking down barriers so everyone has the opportunity to succeed—no matter their zip code, income, race, or disability. As president, I'll ensure everyone's treated with dignity and respect.  https://t.co/OwVUoUSQ7B
1154919416532017152 2019-07-26 18:00:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> Growing up with a stutter, my parents taught me from a young age that being different is no barrier to success. Instead, the barrier is far too often our laws, our institutions, and our culture. The ADA began to change all of that.
1154919415554727936 2019-07-26 18:00:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> I've always been proud to have cosponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act, signed into law 29 years ago. Thanks to the vision &amp; persistence of @SenatorHarkin &amp; many disability leaders, this bill was a critical step in the fight for equal rights for people with disabilities.
1154875483428986881 2019-07-26 15:05:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> Earlier this week, @DrBiden,@RepRichmond, and I had the opportunity to spend some time with the great folks at @YEPNOLA in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was great getting to see the work they’re doing to inspire the children in their community.  https://t.co/hubDMkr8bm
1154839557118074881 2019-07-26 12:43:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The marine transit system in Alaska is vital to rural communities—but faces draconian cuts in funding. IBU is on strike to ensure this lifeline for Alaskans will continue to serve communities from Ketchikan to Kodiak. The governor must restore full funding immediately. @ILWU
1154837541201338368 2019-07-26 12:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump is fighting tooth &amp; nail to deny those fleeing dangerous situations their right to seek asylum in our nation. We should uphold our moral responsibility &amp; enforce our immigration laws with dignity—not turn away those fleeing violence, war, &amp; poverty.   https://t.co/1CVPP3sJo3
1154809858555883522 2019-07-26 10:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump’s tariff war with China is crushing American farmers. It's easy to talk tough when someone else feels the pain. We need to be tough AND smart—working with allies to curb China’s abusive trade practices, not isolating us from our closest partners.  https://t.co/pY75vyEFn3
1154779660305260544 2019-07-26 08:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let's call Trump’s travel ban what it is: a disgrace. We are a nation of immigrants, and we need a leader who recognizes that our diversity is our greatest asset.  https://t.co/YLkEI4xHb2
1154753691628507138 2019-07-26 07:01:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> Because a union fought for their private health insurance plan, Marcy and her husband were able to retire with dignity and respect. That’s why my plan to protect and build on Obamacare will give folks the option to choose what’s best for them.
1154753637274533888 2019-07-26 07:01:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> Like so many other Americans, Marcy prefers to keep her private insurance while recognizing that a public health insurance option is necessary for some of her friends and family.  https://t.co/1PnfSGC5WC
1154500277124251648 2019-07-25 14:14:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> Since 1973, over 160 individuals in this country have been sentenced to death and were later exonerated. Because we can’t ensure that we get these cases right every time, we must eliminate the death penalty.   https://t.co/o9LQHWwmt7
1154474657275240450 2019-07-25 12:33:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> Had the opportunity to discuss my plans to advance equity and opportunity for communities of color all across the nation today at the @NatUrbanLeague Conference in Indianapolis. Thank you for having me!  https://t.co/m7s2Mjw671
1154454908482945024 2019-07-25 11:14:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> Governor @RicardoRossello’s resignation is a testament to the power of everyday people to effect change and a critical opportunity for Puerto Rico, which has been battered by natural disasters and corrupt governments for far too long. #PuertoRicoSeLevanta
1154453525331664901 2019-07-25 11:09:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> The black agenda is America’s agenda. This morning, I discussed my plans for communities of color on the @TJMShow.   https://t.co/Q07kNyGp2J
1154443201048129536 2019-07-25 10:28:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here’s the deal: health care is a right. Every American should have the peace of mind that comes from  access to affordable health care, and we can get there by protecting and building on Obamacare.  Read my full plan at  https://t.co/IwFG48n2hJ.
1154423731449712640 2019-07-25 09:10:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> Denali's death marks the 3rd murder of a trans woman in South Carolina this year.  Violence against the transgender community is an epidemic—crimes are occurring far too often. It's our moral obligation to put an end to violence in our communities.    https://t.co/cW4gRobK3M
1154204620354228224 2019-07-24 18:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Russia undermined our democracy by interfering in the 2016 election. That's a fact. We need a President who will stand up to the Kremlin, push back against Putin, and take immediate steps to ensure the security of our elections.
1154195410589761538 2019-07-24 18:03:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> One of the great things about being on the trail is getting a chance to have lunch with great folks like @MayorMikeDuggan and community leaders in Dearborn.  https://t.co/gIrUARzmYN
1154141707337961474 2019-07-24 14:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As President, I will provide states with funds to shift from incarceration to prevention, including addressing factors correlated with incarceration like illiteracy and child abuse.   Read our plan:  https://t.co/FWDpncAAaI  https://t.co/YPQHMJ36Im
1154122831501778945 2019-07-24 13:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you, @NAACP, for hosting a thoughtful discussion in Detroit. As I shared today, there’s nothing we can’t do if given half a chance.  https://t.co/F1U6wjnxoG
1154119059685826560 2019-07-24 13:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe in redemption. Formerly incarcerated individuals deserve the opportunity to be productive members of society. I’ll expand access to mental health &amp; substance use treatment, education, job training, and housing.   Read our plan:  https://t.co/FWDpnciYM8  https://t.co/ShIE1GsEun
1154111507531096064 2019-07-24 12:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Certain life experiences are strongly correlated with an increased likelihood of future incarceration - abuse, illiteracy, experience in foster care.  I’ll invest in our children to address underlying factors driving incarceration. Read our plan at  https://t.co/fsdoT4QPAb  https://t.co/bYYmWTCA4V
1154051047285039104 2019-07-24 08:29:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm about to take the stage at the @NAACP Presidential Candidates Forum. Watch live!  https://t.co/7OrinSc8gy
1153807800016896000 2019-07-23 16:23:10 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s about time we start rewarding workers with the resources to live with dignity &amp; respect—that begins with better wages and benefits, and the right to collectively organize and strike. Today, I stand with @unitehere airline catering workers as they rally together at DCA. #1Job
1153794417674903552 2019-07-23 15:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I had the opportunity to visit @YEPNOLA in New Orleans, Louisiana with @RepRichmond today. I commend the work they’re doing to ensure bright futures for the children in their community.  https://t.co/YeJeHDDThq
1153791650205855752 2019-07-23 15:19:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We currently have insufficient data to eliminate racial &amp; ethnic biases in our criminal justice system. As president, I’ll urge states to add info regarding ethnicity to their data collection to understand how groups—like Latinx—interact with the system.  https://t.co/fsdoT4QPAb
1153783092911300611 2019-07-23 14:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must reform our juvenile justice system to give children a second chance to live up to their potential. My plan will invest in juvenile justice programs, protect juvenile records, &amp; end the use of detention as punishment for status offenses. Our plan:  https://t.co/FWDpnciYM8  https://t.co/n1lCcuirS0
1153729151272148994 2019-07-23 11:10:39 -0800 <JoeBiden> My plan will counter the rise in hate crimes &amp; reinvigorate community-oriented policing in order to root out persistent crime and hold violent offenders accountable. Read our plan at  https://t.co/fsdoT58qYL.  https://t.co/WbypZ7iguW
1153723538358046720 2019-07-23 10:48:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Equifax settlement is a reminder of the trust we put in major corporations that possess large amounts of personal data. We must continue to hold them accountable for keeping personal information secure and protected.    https://t.co/uTuS3SJQ9Q
1153658129562951681 2019-07-23 06:28:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today I released my plan to reform our criminal justice system.   Equality, equity, justice—these ideas form the American creed. We have never lived up to it and we haven’t always gotten it right, but we’ve never stopped trying. Learn more about my plan at  https://t.co/fsdoT58qYL  https://t.co/qAJoFa5CqN
1153605674313474048 2019-07-23 03:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Too many people are incarcerated in the US – and many don’t have resources to successfully rejoin society after serving their time.  That’s why I’m releasing my plan to reduce our prison population, create a more just society, &amp; make our communities safer.  https://t.co/bnXs8L6bnP  https://t.co/it7JtZ0OjS
1153414702346752009 2019-07-22 14:21:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump’s words and actions are damaging our place in the world and our futures. We are a nation founded on diversity and opportunity for everyone.   I’m running for President because we need to fight back against the incredible abuses of power we’re seeing.  https://t.co/YNdTZMlqeP
1153390505809477632 2019-07-22 12:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our plan to revitalize rural America will provide a path to the middle-class for people in small towns and remote areas across the country. We must build a middle-class where everyone comes along, regardless of zip code.  https://t.co/db1VWHCW5Z
1153365624179089409 2019-07-22 11:06:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump’s continued racist attacks against these members of Congress cannot be tolerated or excused. This is not who we are. We must hold him accountable for his words.
1153356532857225220 2019-07-22 10:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Drug corporations are profiteering off the pocketbooks of sick individuals.  Under a Biden administration, we’ll put a stop to runaway drug pricing so every American has the peace of mind that they can afford their medication.  https://t.co/xaRm1RVsh2
1153338916700925952 2019-07-22 09:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Americans work hard every day, and they deserve a worry-free retirement with a steady income. I’ll put Social Security on a path to long-run solvency through a tax on the wealthiest wage earners. Learn more about my plan for Older Americans at  https://t.co/HtXrkNMdlV.
1153081331682807811 2019-07-21 16:16:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> 9 years ago today, I proudly stood alongside President Obama as he signed the Wall Street reform and consumer protection bill into law.   In the midst of the financial crisis we inherited, we fought to protect working Americans from predatory practices and prevent another crash.
1153035668123267072 2019-07-21 13:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I was never more proud to serve as Vice President than on the day President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act. As president, I’ll protect the progress we’ve made and build on Obamacare to ensure every American receives quality, affordable health care.  https://t.co/FocwDh7Rqv
1153009244205199361 2019-07-21 11:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ended my trip to Nevada by participating in a @nvdems Local Brews and National Views. Thank you to all who attended, it was a pleasure spending time with you!  https://t.co/RwTA55NgLb
1152979045736337408 2019-07-21 09:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every American deserves the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care.  My new plan will allow people to buy into a public option, increase premium tax credits for middle class families, and expand coverage to low-income Americans.  https://t.co/64JECAyTKu
1152952598024073216 2019-07-21 07:44:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> Happy #NationalIceCreamDay! I hope everyone enjoys some ice cream on this hot summer day. I’ll be eating a pint of chocolate chip myself.  https://t.co/Oi9Sk9D4tE
1152895999150440451 2019-07-21 04:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know if we come together there is nothing we can’t do. That gives me the strength to know we can defeat Donald Trump and once again put this nation on the path towards dignity and decency and justice.  https://t.co/WpJat7FcIV
1152739969598799872 2019-07-20 17:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today was our first nationwide Day of Action! It was great to spend the day in Las Vegas, Nevada kicking off our phone bank with our incredible volunteers. #TeamJoe  https://t.co/kgwJNVLzjN
1152735416275132416 2019-07-20 17:21:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> Seven years ago, our nation watched in horror at the news from Aurora, Colorado. 12 innocent lives, full of so much promise, were cut short in an act of terror. Many more injured and traumatized. Today, we recommit to taking action to reduce gun violence
1152718375514230787 2019-07-20 16:14:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> That's what we're capable of when we come together in service of something larger than ourselves. That's the America I have faith in.
1152718374046175232 2019-07-20 16:14:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> In that moment, we weren't thinking about being Democrats or Republicans. We weren't thinking about a way to contort the nation's victory in favor of one political faction or another. We were, quite simply, Americans—joined together in our wonder, awe, and shared humanity.
1152718372905345024 2019-07-20 16:14:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> Fifty years ago today, in every corner of our country, Americans gathered together to watch our nation put three astronauts on the moon. For a moment, we all held our breath together, knowing we were about to bear witness to a first for mankind.
1152638882002997248 2019-07-20 10:58:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m heading to Detroit at the end of the month for our second Democratic debate. Supporters in every part of the country are coming together on July 31 to have parties to watch the debate. I hope you’ll host one in your community:  https://t.co/bZ3kMKnAsd  https://t.co/TDKTGrVeTy
1152631756748726273 2019-07-20 10:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This heat wave is a reminder that we’re already feeling the impacts of climate change.. It’s clear we need to take drastic action now to solve our climate crisis and protect the planet for future generations.  Stay safe this weekend.  https://t.co/UwNKcKXIWg
1152597783074893824 2019-07-20 08:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m running for president to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild its backbone — the middle class, and unify all Americans.  If you’re with me, let me know by committing to vote today:  https://t.co/5hv4ZP5LGJ
1152579988891340802 2019-07-20 07:04:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> Los comentarios del gobernador @RicardoRossello son vergonzosos. El lenguaje de odio no debe ser protegido, independientemente del título político. El pueblo de #PuertoRico será escuchado y decidirán quién va a dirigir su gobierno.
1152558478776504320 2019-07-20 05:38:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> Governor @RicardoRossello's comments are shameful. Hateful language should be given no safe harbor -- regardless of political title. The people of #PuertoRico will be heard, and they will decide who leads their government.
1152397111801131011 2019-07-19 18:57:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> It was great meeting so many folks today at Tamales Liliana in Los Angeles. Thank you @HildaSolis for having lunch with me!  https://t.co/F2K2I1GOS6
1152313660787908610 2019-07-19 13:26:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here's the deal, my plan to build on Obamacare will expand health care coverage and lower costs — without raising taxes on the middle class.  Proponents of Medicare for All can't say the same.  https://t.co/V6GxL8MaFI
1152275911770685440 2019-07-19 10:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump’s comments this week were despicable.  https://t.co/fOPHDDr1S4
1152250494275878912 2019-07-19 09:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tomorrow, I’m heading to Nevada for our first Day of Action! Talking with neighbors about what’s at stake in this election is how we’ll win. RSVP to join us in Las Vegas for a phone bank kickoff:  https://t.co/xDvumwKVns
1152226586705313793 2019-07-19 07:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In America, health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the wealthy few.  As president, I’ll repeal President Trump’s tax cuts for the super wealthy and close capital gains loopholes to help ensure everyone has access to the care they deserve.  https://t.co/URjgZONjmL
1151982730172932096 2019-07-18 15:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@DrBiden is visiting South Carolina tomorrow, and I’m excited for the folks of Summerville to have the opportunity to meet her! Head to  https://t.co/2Yyl5xQcSo to RSVP.
1151964359167553536 2019-07-18 14:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Stopped by Dulan's On Crenshaw to serve some food and chat about why I'm running for president. A great way to start our trip to Los Angeles!  https://t.co/K0e8WAVsup
1151952280360574976 2019-07-18 13:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America’s teachers shouldn’t have to work a second job after a full day in the classroom just to make ends meet — but stories like these are all too common. In a Biden administration, we’ll change that by giving our educators the pay they deserve.  https://t.co/2oZSCg9vfo
1151937181633667077 2019-07-18 12:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The ACA was and is a big deal. It took a century of presidents trying to expand health care access, and President Obama and I got it done. We can’t start over.  I’ll fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to tear it down—Republican or Democrat.  https://t.co/kCbETQ5MiD
1151926065310384133 2019-07-18 11:45:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> Rebuilding America’s middle class is the major moral obligation of our time. And today, House Democrats took an important step forward in that fight by passing the #RaiseTheWage Act. It’s past time for a $15 minimum wage and a real pathway to the middle class.
1151892134225559552 2019-07-18 09:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This Saturday, our campaign will be hosting a nationwide Day of Action. Supporters across the country will be coming together, organizing communities, and talking with voters about what’s at stake in this election. Join us:  https://t.co/QZOk7gXUeP  https://t.co/167UaHLkKo
1151868355374174208 2019-07-18 07:56:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> I believe protecting the ACA is the most important thing we can do. It covered 20 million Americans and protects over 100 million with pre-existing conditions. I want to hear how it helped you and your family. Click below to share your #MyACAStory:  https://t.co/y7dkPXrxex
1151840112768106499 2019-07-18 06:04:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> Like Mark and Marianne, the lives of millions of Americans depend on the Affordable Care Act. We can’t tear it down. We need to protect and build on Obamacare to ensure every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care.  https://t.co/o21UoS0ZzT
1151661204521328641 2019-07-17 18:13:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let's make sure he doesn’t get four more years in the White House. If you’re with me, join our campaign and let’s get to work:  https://t.co/7pOeAlM5Ee
1151661203351117825 2019-07-17 18:13:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> So, Mr. President, I am here to tell you this. This is OUR country: The United States of America. You'll never understand what makes us strong. And that's why the American people are going to vote you out of office next year.
1151661202117922816 2019-07-17 18:13:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> These members of Congress — children of immigrants, just like so many of us — are an example of exactly what makes America great.
1151661201212022784 2019-07-17 18:13:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here's what has always made America great:  Honesty. Decency. Treating everyone with dignity. Demonizing no one — not the poor, the powerless, the immigrant, the other. Giving hate no safe harbor. Understanding that, as Americans, we are part of something bigger than ourselves.
1151661200276672514 2019-07-17 18:13:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump thinks that our nation's great diversity makes us weak — because he has no idea what makes us great.
1151661199160958976 2019-07-17 18:13:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’ve heard it before throughout our history, but it has no place in America in 2019.  It’s clear that Donald Trump is trying to divide us by race and gender. It’s immoral. Our children are listening.
1151661197839753217 2019-07-17 18:13:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> Four days ago, the President of the United States suggested that four elected members of Congress, all women of color, ought to "go back" to the countries "from which they came." And every day since he has repeated this ugly, racist refrain.
1151630157037350913 2019-07-17 16:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> During Beau’s fight with glioblastoma, we learned about the incredible breakthroughs made in cancer treatment — and those that are right over the horizon. This is a fight we can't postpone. I know — with the power of America’s best minds — we can end cancer as we know it. #GBMDay
1151615584230150144 2019-07-17 15:12:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> Wrapped up our trip with stops in Sioux City and Council Bluffs, where we discussed our new plan to ensure that everyone has access to quality, affordable health care. Thank you for a great few days, Iowa!  https://t.co/WQvgHV3P2f
1151579857937215488 2019-07-17 12:50:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> We will provide rural hospitals with the adequate funding and flexibility they need to keep their doors open, double funding for community health centers, and expand the pipeline of rural health care providers.
1151579856683118592 2019-07-17 12:50:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Rural health care will be a top priority in the Biden administration. Under our plan, rural hospitals won’t be threatened by having to get by on low Medicare reimbursement rates for all.
1151579855579951104 2019-07-17 12:50:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> A Biden administration will help rural communities fully access federal resources and tackle persistent poverty in rural America.
1151579854489432076 2019-07-17 12:50:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> We will pursue a trade policy that works for American farmers, transform our agriculture sector, triple funding for rural broadband, and bring cutting-edge manufacturing jobs to rural America.
1151579853545758720 2019-07-17 12:50:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> My plan recognizes how much rural communities contribute to this nation and how much they’ve been hurt by this president’s damaging policies. We are going to build a pathway to the middle class for rural Americans, in rural America.
1151579851360485378 2019-07-17 12:50:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> Rural communities power our nation. They feed our bodies and fuel our engines. A healthy, vibrant rural America is essential to the success of our country. That’s why I released my plan for rural America:  https://t.co/RkAm1wJJcI  https://t.co/9Xdg0WduPO
1151569758694731777 2019-07-17 12:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In a Biden administration, we’ll give people the choice to buy into a public option like Medicare. That’s the best way to lower costs and achieve universal coverage.  Read our full plan here:  https://t.co/RIhlOd6xBG  https://t.co/i117zqACNJ
1151518169112203269 2019-07-17 08:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Justice Stevens was a decent, honorable man who served our country well. He understood that the most important thing about being on the Court is treating people with dignity and respect. I was honored to have known him. @DrBiden and I are sending our prayers to his family.
1151272298835578881 2019-07-16 16:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Had the opportunity to speak with some great folks in Manning, Iowa, today about our new plan to revitalize rural economies. Thank you to everyone who joined us!  https://t.co/F2MuPGmGvN
1151233540673216514 2019-07-16 13:53:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump’s entire re-election strategy is based on fear and hatred of migrants — this is just the latest example.  We can enforce our immigration laws with dignity — and fix the asylum system so that it is both fair to those who need protection and deters those who do not.
1151233539523981312 2019-07-16 13:53:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our Statue of Liberty invites in the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. Now President Trump wants to slam the door in the face of children and families fleeing war, poverty, and violence.  It’s cruel. It’s not who we are.  https://t.co/luIZlx1UcZ
1151228762123620353 2019-07-16 13:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Summer vacation season has started, but many hardworking Americans like the @ATUComm members currently striking the VTA/TCI aren’t taking a break in their fight for safe working conditions, higher wages, and good benefits. I’m proud to stand with them.
1151215172704509952 2019-07-16 12:41:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to Governor Tom Vilsack and @ChristieVilsack for opening up your home for yesterday’s house party. It was a pleasure getting to spend some time with the residents of Waukee, Iowa!  https://t.co/A6GC1AEJKf
1151202589242822656 2019-07-16 11:51:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@DrBiden and I had a very important meeting with @DrakeUGriff while at Drake University yesterday.  https://t.co/CvQrwyggb9
1151194346978512896 2019-07-16 11:18:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m glad to hear Matt is doing well — stories like his remind us of the need to protect and build upon the Affordable Care Act. We can’t afford to start over.  Read our plan here:  https://t.co/RIhlOcOWK8
1150943381129814017 2019-07-15 18:41:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> At the #AARPIowaForum, I laid out my plan for older Americans. A Biden administration will lower drug costs, protect &amp; strengthen Medicare &amp; Social Security, &amp; help middle-class families grow their savings—because everyone deserves to retire with dignity.   https://t.co/rYVyCoDOAT  https://t.co/0ykyiaehBj
1150860586047156224 2019-07-15 13:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Iowa, I hope you’ll join us this week to hear about our bold vision for the future of our country. Head to  https://t.co/7mV8NCg4lJ to find an event in your community.
1150779271583059968 2019-07-15 07:48:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> In a Biden administration, we’ll protect the Affordable Care Act and the progress we’ve made — and won’t rest until every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care.  Read the full plan here:  https://t.co/RIhlOcOWK8
1150778836482699266 2019-07-15 07:47:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> In America, health care is a right — not a privilege dependent on your gender, race, sexual orientation, income or zip code. Our plan will address systemic inequities to ensure every American receives the care they need and deserve.  https://t.co/JDZPUaLc5i
1150777789995528193 2019-07-15 07:43:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our plan will stand up to the abuse of power by prescription drug corporations and take concrete steps to lower drug prices for Americans. Because no one should have to choose between putting food on the table or filling their prescription.  https://t.co/fXyUfRDQtd
1150776640894636032 2019-07-15 07:38:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> For too many Americans with insurance, health care costs are still too high. Our plan will not only provide coverage for uninsured Americans, but it will also make health care more affordable for those who have it today.  https://t.co/6UbtxSLLxY
1150775755313487874 2019-07-15 07:34:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> We will provide premium-free access to this public option — with the full scope of Medicaid benefits — for people who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid, but were denied access by governors and state legislatures.  https://t.co/ek22EQW1it
1150774989207101440 2019-07-15 07:31:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our plan will give Americans the choice to buy into a public option like Medicare. That’s the best way to lower costs and achieve universal coverage.  https://t.co/BrT8Ya2j6b
1150774078233387008 2019-07-15 07:28:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> I understand the appeal of Medicare for All — but folks supporting it should be clear that it means getting rid of Obamacare. And, I'm not for that.  We should protect and build upon the Affordable Care Act and the progress we’ve made. Not tear it down and start over.
1150706574610128896 2019-07-15 03:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Affordable Care Act was a historic achievement. 20 million Americans gained coverage. Over 100 million with pre-existing conditions finally got protection. We can’t tear it down.  So today, I’m releasing my plan to Protect &amp; Build on Obamacare:  https://t.co/RIhlOcOWK8  https://t.co/laDUcIhRjM
1150552835966328832 2019-07-14 16:49:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> A job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about dignity. It’s about being able to look your child in the eye and say everything is going to be ok. But far too many people today can’t do that.  We’ve got to rebuild America’s middle class and ensure everyone gets a fair shot.
1150486031352967168 2019-07-14 12:23:39 -0800 <JoeBiden> America’s strength is and has always been rooted in our diversity. But President Trump continues to spew hateful rhetoric, sow division, and stoke racial tensions for his own political gain.  Let's be clear: Racism and xenophobia have no place in America.
1150227161707532288 2019-07-13 19:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to everyone who joined us in Londonderry, New Hampshire, where we discussed our plans to build an inclusive middle class where everyone comes along — regardless of race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability.  https://t.co/3BCp1cYhHm
1150207029430095872 2019-07-13 17:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Las redadas de inmigración (ICE) del presidente Trump son inhumanas. Sus tácticas no resuelven nada. No deberíamos estar aterrorizando comunidades y dividiendo familias. Debemos proporcionar un camino hacia la ciudadanía y encontrar una solución duradera.
1150183121620332544 2019-07-13 16:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s young people like the @NHYoungDems that give me so much hope and excitement for the future of our country.  https://t.co/DcsbEFGpVS
1150146631569989633 2019-07-13 13:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump’s ICE raids are inhumane. His scare tactics solve nothing. We shouldn't be terrorizing communities and splitting up families. We should provide a pathway to citizenship and find a lasting solution.
1150131532092383232 2019-07-13 12:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m heartbroken to hear of the passing of Héctor Figueroa. Héctor was a stalwart champion in the fight to ensure every worker receives the respect and dignity they’ve earned. My thoughts are with his family and his loved ones.
1150122523075457025 2019-07-13 12:19:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> Had the opportunity to spend some time with the great residents of Atkinson, New Hampshire, today. Thank you all for the warm welcome into your community!  https://t.co/A2HLYUh3Li
1150090763214004224 2019-07-13 10:13:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As individuals, and as a nation, we have to prove to the world that the United States is prepared to lead—not just with the example of our power, but the power of our example.  I will take decisive steps to renew our core American values and return transparency to our government.  https://t.co/A13K4rrAtQ
1149867479805628418 2019-07-12 19:25:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> It was a pleasure spending time with the inspiring young leaders of the @NHYoungDems — especially @RepDenny — in Portsmouth. Thank you to everyone who came out tonight!  https://t.co/TZqmAzX4mm
1149821237184487424 2019-07-12 16:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Had to pull the team over for a quick ice cream stop! This time we’re at Annabelle’s Ice Cream in Portsmouth, NH.  https://t.co/hAtX7RN6QR
1149812137512120320 2019-07-12 15:45:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to everyone who joined us in Dover, New Hampshire! We had a great time discussing how we will rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class.  https://t.co/cVJyXChtQF
1149789276776935426 2019-07-12 14:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The threat Donald Trump poses to our national security — and to who we are as a country — is so extreme we cannot afford to ignore it.  https://t.co/UGP4EN1PMw
1149481120947245057 2019-07-11 17:50:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to champion liberty and democracy, reclaim our credibility, and look with unrelenting optimism and determination toward the future.  https://t.co/YCPh3YB0e8
1149415766409850881 2019-07-11 13:30:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to champion liberty and democracy. We have to reclaim our credibility. We have to look with unrelenting optimism and determination toward the future.  Head to  https://t.co/Iopa13F7wt to read our full plan.
1149415765256396800 2019-07-11 13:30:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must once more harness that power and rally the Free World to meet the challenges facing our world today—and it falls to the United States of America to do it.  No other nation has the capacity. No other nation is built on that idea—that promise. And it’s in our self-interest.
1149415764262363136 2019-07-11 13:30:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> No army on earth can match how the electric idea of liberty passes freely from person to person, jumps borders, transcends languages and cultures—how it can supercharge communities of ordinary citizens into activists and organizers and change agents.
1149415762588852224 2019-07-11 13:30:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> A Biden administration will place the United States back at the head of the table to mobilize global action on global threats—especially those unique to our century.  https://t.co/zJjegImVOB
1149415760852377601 2019-07-11 13:30:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> We know that economic security is national security. But there are a lot of communities across this country that are hurting—because we’ve neglected the basics.  We will equip our people to succeed in the global economy with a foreign policy for the middle class.  https://t.co/Y8q6TWKXBP
1149415757438246912 2019-07-11 13:30:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> I will invite my fellow democratic leaders to put strengthening democracy back on the global agenda.  We will organize and host, during the first year of my administration, a global Summit for Democracy to renew the spirit and shared purpose of the nations of the Free World.  https://t.co/KRSbivKXo5
1149415755789885442 2019-07-11 13:30:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to prove to the world that the United States is prepared to lead—not just with the example of our power, but the power of our example.  To that end, as president, I will take decisive steps to renew our core American values and return transparency to our government.  https://t.co/GmhzHmGGzu
1149415754204422144 2019-07-11 13:30:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> We only have one opportunity to reset our democracy after Trump—we have to be prepared to make the most of it.  First, we must repair and reinvigorate our own democracy.  https://t.co/02G73Q45dr
1149415753063571456 2019-07-11 13:30:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> The threat Donald Trump poses to our national security, and to who we are as a country, is so extreme we cannot afford to ignore it.  His erratic policies and failures to uphold basic democratic principles have muddied our reputation and our place in the world.
1149415752040112130 2019-07-11 13:30:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> In 2019, foreign policy is domestic policy, and domestic policy is foreign policy. They are a deeply connected set of choices we make about how to advance the American way of life and our vision for the future.
1149415751289384960 2019-07-11 13:30:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today in New York City, I laid out my foreign policy vision for America. A vision built on restoring dignified leadership at home and respected leadership on the world stage.
1149364201305051136 2019-07-11 10:05:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> WATCH LIVE: Joe Biden Delivers Foreign Policy Address in New York City  https://t.co/P9LeZCIr1C
1149257271345422337 2019-07-11 03:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Embracing dictators. Threatening war. Embarrassing the United States.  That’s the #TrumpDoctrine.  Reclaiming American leadership starts now.  https://t.co/8BQv50aseA
1149155853095919616 2019-07-10 20:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, we celebrate Journeyman Lineman Recognition Day and the work @IBEW does to keep lineworkers safe. These brave men and women do the hard work of powering America’s electric grid, economy, and future. Our country can't function without the important work they do.
1149107031590285313 2019-07-10 17:04:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our campaign starts at the local level — neighbors talking with neighbors and organizing their communities in every corner of the country. If you’re ready to get to work, sign up to host an organizing meeting for our nationwide Day of Action on July 20th:  https://t.co/6KVUlaLEPb
1149094700122595328 2019-07-10 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump can avoid talking about climate change all he wants, but it doesn’t change the fact that it is real, is here, and requires our urgent action.  We can't afford four more years of a climate change denier in the White House.  https://t.co/iI3P17wRlE
1149054434657259520 2019-07-10 13:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> New Hampshire, I’m heading your way this weekend to talk about our plans to rebuild the backbone of the country — the middle class. Head to  https://t.co/G6YWOs7Oxu to find an event in your community. Hope to see you there!
1149026248967905281 2019-07-10 11:43:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@USWNT, congratulations on the big win and thank you for the jersey! Your talent, heart, and advocacy for equal pay represents the best of America and serves as an inspiration for all. #USWNTParade  https://t.co/0cDZiV8xz0
1148975665468694529 2019-07-10 08:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tomorrow, I’m heading to New York City to talk about my foreign policy vision for America — we need to restore dignified leadership at home and respected leadership on the world stage. RSVP to join us:  https://t.co/UBvpeLUJf9
1148767718864297985 2019-07-09 18:35:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know the history of this country. I’m amazed how far we’ve come, but I know how much further we have to go.  We can get there — together.  https://t.co/TmREN4zy74
1148731053713944576 2019-07-09 16:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here’s what I commit to you: I will name a Secretary of Education who is an educator.  https://t.co/FC37ZMAKAr
1148682987288088577 2019-07-09 12:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The abuse of a child is one of the most heinous, despicable abuses of power imaginable. It is inexcusably poor judgment for a US Attorney to seek leniency for someone guilty of it. Secretary Acosta should provide his resignation immediately.
1148673687538810882 2019-07-09 12:22:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t tear down the ACA. We should protect and build on it. In America, health care should be a right—not a privilege.  As president, I’ll do everything in my power to stand up to the attacks on the ACA and expand coverage to ensure everyone has access to the care they need.
1148673686360264704 2019-07-09 12:22:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Affordable Care Act was and is a big deal. It covered 20 million more people, protects more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions, and expanded Medicaid — giving millions of Americans the peace of mind that comes with health insurance.
1148673684724469762 2019-07-09 12:22:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, the Affordable Care Act is back in the courts — putting the health care of millions of Americans at risk. It’s clear some will stop at nothing to sabotage Obamacare and roll back the progress we’ve made.  https://t.co/7SEAx4HZrd
1148367659584634880 2019-07-08 16:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to everyone at our town hall discussion in Charleston, South Carolina, for your thoughtful questions on ending gun violence, combating the opioid epidemic, and ensuring every American has access to quality, affordable health care.  https://t.co/Dbabofnq4v
1148331457678630914 2019-07-08 13:42:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Democratic Party is lucky to have leaders like Eric, and I look forward to continuing to work with him on the pressing issues facing Americans.
1148331456718082050 2019-07-08 13:42:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> His leadership on the House Intelligence Committee and his influential voice pushing the Trump Administration to secure our elections have helped make clear the stakes for our country in next year's election.
1148331455858319361 2019-07-08 13:42:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@EricSwalwell ran a passionate campaign, and I commend him for bringing more attention to the urgent need for gun safety reform in America.
1148303738072961025 2019-07-08 11:52:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It was the honor of my lifetime to serve with a man who I believe was a great president, a historic figure, and most important to me, a close friend.  He selected me. I’ll take his judgment about my record, my character, and my ability to handle the job over anyone else’s.  https://t.co/XoZJhNl6xX
1148026634278232064 2019-07-07 17:30:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we don't defeat Donald Trump, the character of this nation will be fundamentally and forever altered.  https://t.co/ZgULt8Y47v
1147991178689810437 2019-07-07 15:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I had the opportunity to meet Cameron Boyce at this year’s Courage Awards and through his work with @ItsOnUs. He was filled with so much light and served as a tremendous role model for young people. He's gone far too soon. @DrBiden and I are sending our prayers to his family.  https://t.co/4bpbqwqnrO
1147928012467449856 2019-07-07 10:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congratulations to the @USWNT on back-to-back Women’s World Cup titles! You never fail to make our country proud — on and off the field. #OneNationOneTeam  https://t.co/X22QgLUdfB
1147686923621658624 2019-07-06 19:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This afternoon in Sumter, South Carolina, I discussed why I decided to run for Senate years ago — to stand up to the abuse of power and to ensure all Americans have a fair shot at the American dream. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us!  https://t.co/v9ASYISIHF
1147679935764369408 2019-07-06 18:33:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today I sat down with leaders in Williamsburg County, South Carolina. We talked about the issues impacting rural communities like broadband access, investing in education and infrastructure, and healthcare.  https://t.co/MS61moVTRU
1147618221144576001 2019-07-06 14:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Team, we're training a new generation of organizers across the country. Apply for the Team Joe Organizing Fellowship before Monday, July 8th to learn the ins-and-outs of grassroots and digital organizing in our eight-week online training program.   Apply:  https://t.co/wEbnzNQ3dD  https://t.co/HQLnmjiURA
1147582214135275521 2019-07-06 12:04:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m about to take the stage in Sumter, South Carolina. Watch live!  https://t.co/Rd1EKSjxUO
1147573343249477632 2019-07-06 11:29:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> America is an idea, unlike any other country in the world. #FourthOfJuly  https://t.co/OBNe1OP7Bg
1147319451794194432 2019-07-05 18:40:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> No child’s future should be determined by their gender, race, zip code, parents' income, or disability. Full stop. In a Biden administration, we’ll make historic investments in our public schools to ensure every kid in America gets a fair shot. #StrongPublicSchools
1147293078539005952 2019-07-05 16:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to @NEAToday for a great discussion this afternoon on how we can work together to create #StrongPublicSchools. I can promise you that @DrBiden and I will be the best partners and fiercest advocates in the White House for America’s educators and students. #NEARA19  https://t.co/kKzTLlunk7
1147255078140563456 2019-07-05 14:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Had the opportunity to meet some incredible Iowans at yesterday’s parade in Independence. Thank you to everyone who came out to celebrate the #FourthOfJuly and the values that this country stands for.  https://t.co/MS3OTbNLXH
1147218084501045249 2019-07-05 11:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Looking forward to joining @NEAToday to discuss my plan for #StrongPublicSchools. I know from watching @DrBiden all these years that, for educators, their profession isn’t just what they do, it’s who they are — and it’s time we support them with the pay and dignity they deserve.  https://t.co/LdR17BGTZu
1147192163458879488 2019-07-05 10:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@DrBiden and I had a great time celebrating the #FourthOfJuly at last night's @IowaCubs game!  https://t.co/EU0zCBybCa
1146970224475955200 2019-07-04 19:33:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> I had the opportunity to congratulate some newly minted U.S. citizens in Des Moines, Iowa. Tonight’s naturalization ceremony — on the anniversary of our independence — serves as a reminder that being a nation of immigrants is one of our greatest strengths. #FourthOfJuly  https://t.co/YbxD36sPRm
1146916849570836481 2019-07-04 16:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We just wrapped up a great event in Marshalltown, Iowa. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us on this #FourthOfJuly!  https://t.co/z6mHBLcPWQ
1146894569952415744 2019-07-04 14:32:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every year on the #FourthOfJuly, presidents, elected leaders, and everyday Americans come together at parades, bbqs, and baseball games to celebrate humankind’s highest ideal — liberty. That’s what we’re celebrating today in Iowa.
1146894569021366274 2019-07-04 14:32:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> Will he offer a robust defense of the democratic values that have always been our strength in times of crisis? We all know the answer to that.  Donald Trump is incapable of celebrating what makes America great because he doesn’t get it.
1146894568169922574 2019-07-04 14:32:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> What will Donald Trump say this evening when he speaks to the nation at an event designed more to stroke his ego than celebrate American ideals? Will he speak to the example America must set to inspire the world?
1146862891238330371 2019-07-04 12:26:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> As I celebrate today with friends &amp; family, I am reflecting on the promise those rebels envisioned 243 years ago. America hasn’t lived up to that promise for most people—but we’ve never stopped trying. We must continue in our pursuit until we achieve equality &amp; liberty for all.
1146862890235912194 2019-07-04 12:26:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to be against his policies that are further entrenching economic inequality in this nation. That are rigging the system against the middle class.  That too is an attack on our democracy, on our liberty.
1146862888902172677 2019-07-04 12:26:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s not enough to be against the way Donald Trump conducts himself — we have to be against the way he assaults the dignity of women, people of color, and immigrants.
1146862887769694208 2019-07-04 12:26:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to take on the inequalities in our system that are causing too many today—in America and around the world—to question their faith in the ability of democracy to deliver for them.  It’s not enough to be for political equality. We have to be for economic fairness as well.
1146862886825934849 2019-07-04 12:26:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> My liberty, depends on yours. Our liberty as a nation rests on our ability to ensure equal access and equal opportunity — not just for our own children, but all our children.
1146862885869641729 2019-07-04 12:26:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> But we must also remember, as JFK put it, that ours is “not the individual liberty of one but the indivisible liberty of all.” Donald Trump doesn’t get that.
1146862884519129088 2019-07-04 12:26:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> America is the heart of the Free World, and we must defend it. That is how the #FourthOfJuly is best honored — by remembering that our Declaration is first and foremost a call to arms, in defense of liberty.
1146862883420221442 2019-07-04 12:26:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> And ever since then, presidents and patriots have gathered together on the Fourth to reflect on the greater meaning of our American experiment.
1146862882291888128 2019-07-04 12:26:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> 243 years ago, a group of rebels in Philadelphia pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to a revolutionary idea, to the self-evident truth that all men — and women — are created equal.
1146833802733465602 2019-07-04 10:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s fitting that we’re celebrating Independence Day in Independence, Iowa. Thank you to everyone who said hello at this morning’s #FourthOfJuly parade — it was great to see so many supporters!  https://t.co/tEOXY8wLAn
1146776927480365056 2019-07-04 06:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America is an idea — stronger than any army, more powerful than any dictator. It gives hope to the most desperate people on Earth. Instills in us the belief that no matter where you start in life, there's nothing you can't achieve.  That's worth celebrating. Happy #FourthofJuly
1146641031892365312 2019-07-03 21:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to everyone who came out to our event in Waterloo! RSVP to join us tomorrow in Independence and Marshalltown:  https://t.co/PyvclvDFPY  https://t.co/oEwfwHez3A
1146537852655808514 2019-07-03 14:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> DREAMers—young people who came to the U.S. as children—are Americans. They don’t deserve to sit in limbo as the Supreme Court decides whether President Trump can end the Obama-Biden DACA policy. Congress should act now to give them a path to citizenship.  https://t.co/4teULJvgki
1146501865074413568 2019-07-03 12:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> South Carolina, I’m heading your way this weekend to talk with you about how we’ll build an inclusive middle class where everyone comes along. Head to  https://t.co/ie4M0dWVIR to RSVP for an event in your community.
1146430889896943618 2019-07-03 07:49:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> Rooms of people packed body to body. Kids being held without access to showers or a change of clothes. It’s simply abhorrent.  We all have a moral obligation to keep speaking out until this administration ends these inhumane policies once and for all.
1146417056184582144 2019-07-03 06:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> El Departamento de Comercio anunció que el formulario Censo 2020 no tendrá la pregunta de ciudadanía de Trump. Esto no es solo una victoria para los inmigrantes y latinos, sino para todos los estadounidenses. Todos merecemos ser contados sin temor!
1146244167179341825 2019-07-02 19:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> John Walsh was an incredible coach and mentor. He always urged us to play the game and live our lives with passion and integrity. @DrBiden and I are sending our prayers to his family — he will be dearly missed.  https://t.co/37HRxXC80i
1146220290558648320 2019-07-02 17:53:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tomorrow, I’m heading to Iowa with @DrBiden to talk with voters about our bold vision for the future. We hope you’ll come out and join us! Head to  https://t.co/jXap7UviAc to RSVP.  https://t.co/XoOuhxbqBB
1146196453947318274 2019-07-02 16:18:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> But as we mark the 55th anniversary, we must recognize that the work is not done. Too many Americans still face the sting of systemic racism and discrimination. We must double down on our efforts to root out these evils and ensure America lives up to its promise for all.
1146196452638674944 2019-07-02 16:18:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> It also laid the groundwork for other milestones and freedoms to follow — from the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Because when justice rings out for one group, it rings for all groups in America. We’re all made better.
1146196451791462402 2019-07-02 16:18:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Civil Rights Act for the first time made real the possibility of equal access to employment. It outlawed discrimination in public facilities, and it gave the Attorney General of the United States of America the power to enforce the law to combat discrimination.
1146196450709331968 2019-07-02 16:18:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> It took the courage and determination of generations of African Americans who refused to wither in the face of racism and intolerance. Their resolve fundamentally changed the character of our nation for the better.
1146196449769721856 2019-07-02 16:18:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today marks 55 years since the signing of the Civil Rights Act — the landmark piece of legislation that brought our nation closer to fulfilling the promise that was made two centuries earlier in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A promise of equality, equity, and fairness for all.
1146184020478218240 2019-07-02 15:29:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Department of Commerce just announced the 2020 Census will not have President Trump’s citizenship question. This is not only a victory for immigrants and Latinos, but for all Americans. Everyone deserves to be counted and have their voices heard without fear.
1146128907474653185 2019-07-02 11:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Luis Alvarez was an American hero—@DrBiden and I are sending our thoughts and prayers to his family.  No one should have to spend their final weeks fighting for the health care and benefits they deserve. We must do better for our 9/11 first responders.  https://t.co/UkMAdNFXVI
1146092920233029632 2019-07-02 09:27:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Make no mistake, this is a modern-day poll tax that overturns the will of Florida voters. It’s unacceptable.   We must ensure everyone — including individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies — has the right to make their voices heard at the ballot box.  https://t.co/s8dFgr0mVm
1145849063734206464 2019-07-01 17:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> One in five students experience mental health problems, but too often they don’t get the care they need. In a Biden administration, we will double the number of mental health professionals in schools to give our kids the support they deserve.  https://t.co/tGh2Rgd9MX
1145804268202418177 2019-07-01 14:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Income inequality is on the rise — made worse by the Trump tax cut that was a giant giveaway to the super-wealthy. We’ve got to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class.   That starts by rewarding work, not just wealth.
1145770925838807040 2019-07-01 12:07:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Iran has now restarted its nuclear program and has become more, rather than less, aggressive. Trump's Iran policy has alienated us from our allies and taken us to the brink of another war in the Middle East.  Everything this president does is backwards.
1145770924999872512 2019-07-01 12:07:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Iran needs to get back into compliance with its nuclear commitments, but Trump appears to have no plan for ensuring that result either. His policy of maximum pressure has produced worse than minimum results.
1145770923959750656 2019-07-01 12:07:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> And even as Trump has rushed to legitimize a dictator in North Korea with dozens of nuclear weapons, he trashed the Iran nuclear deal — a deal that was working to keep Iran far away from a single nuclear bomb.
1145770923166982146 2019-07-01 12:07:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Not one missile or nuclear weapon has been destroyed, not one inspector is on the ground. If anything, the situation has gotten worse. North Korea has continued to churn out fissile material and is no longer an isolated pariah on the world stage.
1145770922101694464 2019-07-01 12:07:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> Diplomacy is important, but diplomacy requires a strategy, a process, and competent leadership to deliver. After three made-for-TV summits, we still don't have a single concrete commitment from North Korea.
1145770921443176448 2019-07-01 12:07:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> In this case, all Trump achieved was a mere promise to restart working-level negotiations — negotiations that should have never ended.
1145770920394579970 2019-07-01 12:07:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> Yet again, Donald Trump has demonstrated that he is more concerned with a photo op for himself than getting results for the American people. He has repeatedly elevated Kim Jong Un — a murderous tyrant — on the international stage in exchange for almost nothing.
1145713671407984640 2019-07-01 08:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump’s failure to lead on the climate crisis is inexcusable — it endangers the future of our country and planet.  As president, I’ll rejoin the #ParisAgreement and rally the world to push our progress further and faster.  https://t.co/CSABVSltRW
1145475854366961664 2019-06-30 16:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> If we want to make Donald Trump a one-term president, it’s going to take everyone stepping up and pitching in what they can. Will you make a donation before our big public fundraising deadline tonight?  https://t.co/BWLrzM9AE6
1145462264868175873 2019-06-30 15:41:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This week, I’m heading back to Iowa to talk with voters about why I’m running for president and my bold vision for the future. Head to  https://t.co/8fR5oV96xe to RSVP to an event in your community. Hope to see you there!
1145396582000447488 2019-06-30 11:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve seen firsthand how hard America’s educators work for little pay and few resources. They deserve better. In a Biden administration, we’ll support our educators by giving them the pay and dignity they deserve.  https://t.co/tGh2RfVyon
1145377455982559233 2019-06-30 10:04:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re relying on the support of grassroots donors across the country to power this campaign — not corporate PACs or lobbyists. Will you chip in before tonight’s end-of-quarter deadline?  https://t.co/h2fvoyS16A
1145157531326668800 2019-06-29 19:30:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> Meeting the newest member of the Biden family today. Congratulations to my niece and nephew. This is what it’s all about. Welcome to the world, sweet Valerie Jean.  https://t.co/TfjGjkp8jR
1145124539350675457 2019-06-29 17:19:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Yesterday’s verdict doesn’t take away the pain or the loss of Heather Heyer on that day in Charlottesville, but is hopefully a step toward healing and a sense of justice.  https://t.co/CZLYSTUtMC
1145104672929308673 2019-06-29 16:00:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> The same forces of hatred rooted in 'birtherism' that questioned @BarackObama's American citizenship, and even his racial identity, are now being used against Senator @KamalaHarris. It’s disgusting and we have to call it out when we see it. Racism has no place in America.
1145001478613954560 2019-06-29 09:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're in a battle for the soul of this nation. We can end the politics of division that’s pulling this country apart and move forward again ⁠— but it’s going to take everyone rolling up their sleeves and doing their part.  Let's get to work.  https://t.co/Q3Y1el5tOY
1144707038234046465 2019-06-28 13:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today marks 50 years since the Stonewall uprising, where those brave individuals took a stand on Christopher St and changed our world forever. We must continue our fight for full LGBTQ equality until everyone is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. #Stonewall50  https://t.co/9X8zf8xWBN
1144700495807881223 2019-06-28 13:14:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve fought my heart out to ensure that civil rights, voting rights, and equal rights are enforced everywhere. These rights are not up to the states to decide. They are embedded in our Constitution. And the federal government has a duty to protect the civil rights of all people.  https://t.co/2vMqzRrg89
1144545980794064896 2019-06-28 03:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> At last night’s first Democratic debate, I laid out why I’m running for president and my bold vision for the future. A vision built on uniting our country, because there's not a single thing the American people can’t do — together. #DemDebate  https://t.co/jzfVUZ5T2x
1144447528437501953 2019-06-27 20:28:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> I just got off the debate stage, where I laid out my vision for the country. We’ll work together to get it done, because there’s not a single thing we can’t do – together. If you agreed with what you heard tonight, join our team and let’s get to work:  https://t.co/2LMjeCxvEs
1144446629812080640 2019-06-27 20:25:13 -0800 <JoeBiden> That’s a wrap! Thanks for following along with us for night two of the Democratic debate. Make sure to follow @TeamJoe to stay up-to-date on everything happening on the campaign. #DemDebate #TeamJoe
1144446151086751744 2019-06-27 20:23:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> "There's not a single thing the American people can't do."  #DemDebate #TeamJoe  https://t.co/Z1VEIM7tbt
1144441974973505536 2019-06-27 20:06:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> We know NATO will fall apart if Donald Trump is elected for four more years. It’s the single most consequential alliance in the history of the United States. #DemDebate  https://t.co/SL2Mq9k161
1144441096816214017 2019-06-27 20:03:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> Retweet if you're proud to be on #TeamJoe! #DemDebate  https://t.co/Z2FKYRE9PX
1144438729072947202 2019-06-27 19:53:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Biden administration will make the largest ever investment in clean energy research and innovation to develop zero-carbon technologies, so America is the engine of the world’s clean energy economy. #DemDebate  https://t.co/1yIcGiOzdH
1144437825309413376 2019-06-27 19:50:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> The members of the NRA are not our opponents — the vast majority of them support common-sense reforms, including universal background checks. The gun manufacturers who bankroll the NRA are our opponent.   As president, Biden will defeat them. #DemDebate
1144436687671648272 2019-06-27 19:45:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Iraq war was a strategic mistake that cost the U.S. dearly. As President, @JoeBiden will use military power responsibly, and never commit our forces to a conflict without fully preparing for the consequences. #DemDebate
1144435476528607232 2019-06-27 19:40:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe Biden shepherded through the Brady Background bill in 1993 and bans on assault weapons and high capacity magazines in 1994.  As president, Joe will defeat the @NRA again. #DemDebate  https://t.co/ZZezO80xZM
1144433312892694529 2019-06-27 19:32:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> Climate change is a global challenge that requires decisive action from every country around the world. Joe Biden will lead an effort to get every major country to ramp up the ambition of their domestic climate targets. #DemDebate  https://t.co/92IcLm6Csa
1144431964923092992 2019-06-27 19:26:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> As President, Joe Biden will export our clean-energy technology across the globe and create high-quality, middle-class jobs here at home. #DemDebate  https://t.co/8iEZoMaEAT
1144428340478173186 2019-06-27 19:12:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe Biden played a key role in securing the extension of the Voting Rights Act—and has advocated for its renewal, and for stronger voter access protections, over the course of his career. #DemDebate  https://t.co/UHs5xgUGCe
1144426369239126016 2019-06-27 19:04:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> “We would reunite those families, period.” #DemDebate  https://t.co/V0iwd43qv8
1144424136149745664 2019-06-27 18:55:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our immigration system must be fixed without tossing our morals aside. This all starts by protecting DREAMers and recognizing the value of immigrants. #DemDebate  https://t.co/JoRqb150gU
1144422941712691201 2019-06-27 18:51:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> As Vice President, Joe Biden worked with the leaders of the Northern Triangle (Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras) to institute reforms tackling corruption, violence, and economic inequality in their countries, reducing migration to the U.S.  #DemDebate
1144420421971980289 2019-06-27 18:41:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> "Health care is personal to me... there are people right now who are facing what I faced, without any of the help I had. We must move now." #DemDebate  https://t.co/SrUZerMhNO
1144417840629501952 2019-06-27 18:30:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> Now, we need to finish the job and make health care a right for all, not a privilege for the few.  #DemDebate  https://t.co/tSFitwiaNm
1144416948236771328 2019-06-27 18:27:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> As VP, Joe Biden stood shoulder to shoulder with President Obama to pass the Affordable Care Act, which:  ✅ Expanded coverage to 20 million add’l Americans ✅ Protected Americans with pre-existing conditions ✅ Expanded Medicaid to millions without access to health insurance  https://t.co/0CNjpSZPom
1144416186702204928 2019-06-27 18:24:15 -0800 <JoeBiden>  https://t.co/H3a61KTPQM
1144415458457788416 2019-06-27 18:21:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> We've got to do better for our educators and our students. In a Biden Administration, we will:  ✅ Give our educators the pay and dignity they deserve ✅ Provide universal Pre-K for all ✅ Double the number of mental health professionals in schools   https://t.co/d1o4WnDczV
1144412190964928513 2019-06-27 18:08:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs and hedge fund managers.   It was built by you.   By ordinary people doing extraordinary things. That’s the history of the journey of America. #DemDebate
1144408605120245760 2019-06-27 17:54:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hey everyone — @TeamJoe here! We’re taking over @JoeBiden’s account while he’s on stage for tonight’s Democratic debate. Throughout the evening, we’ll be giving you the facts on Joe and his record. #DemDebate
1144404552852103170 2019-06-27 17:38:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m about to take the debate stage. The large, diverse Democratic field is evidence of our party's strength. And above all, we all agree that we need to make Donald Trump a one-term president. #DemDebate
1144403920510472192 2019-06-27 17:35:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to choose hope over fear, truth over lies, and unity over division. I hope you’ll tune in tonight as we discuss these important issues and more. If you like what you hear, I ask you to join us by signing up at  https://t.co/FiM7U862fT. Let’s get to work.
1144402896236228610 2019-06-27 17:31:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can do all this and more – all that stands in the way is a broken political system. We have to unite this country. And we can do it without compromising our principles. That’s the only way we’re going to be able to harness the incredible potential of the American people.
1144402554622791712 2019-06-27 17:30:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> Climate change is an existential threat. We have to take urgent, drastic action now to address the climate emergency. On day one, I’ll take the bold action necessary to tackle this crisis head-on and rally the world to raise our ambitions.  https://t.co/Tg2yqpL8DO
1144401990006521857 2019-06-27 17:27:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to transform education. We’ll provide universal Pre-K, triple Title I funding, raise teacher pay, double the number of mental health professionals in our schools, and eliminate disparities between rich and poor schools.  https://t.co/6oqEuc5N8Q
1144401100004630529 2019-06-27 17:24:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> Under my plan, everyone will have the option to buy into a public health plan like Medicare. And we’ll guarantee that the poor – who otherwise would be covered by the Medicaid expansion – are automatically covered, free of charge.
1144400505134833665 2019-06-27 17:21:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act. I was proud every day to serve alongside President Obama as Vice President – but never more so than the day the Affordable Care Act passed. Now we have to finish the job.
1144399836755746823 2019-06-27 17:19:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s time to reward work, not just wealth. On day one, I’ll move to: eliminate the Trump tax cut for the super-wealthy, cut the unjustified loopholes in our tax code, and use that money to invest in America’s future.
1144398542204788741 2019-06-27 17:14:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> The poor are getting poorer and the bottom is falling out of the middle class. Income inequality is on the rise — made worse by the Trump tax cut that was a giant give-away to the super-wealthy.
1144397231723823109 2019-06-27 17:08:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to rebuild the backbone of this nation – the middle class. And this time make sure everyone comes along, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or disability.
1144396615609999361 2019-06-27 17:06:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day we are being reminded what this election is about. Who we are. What we stand for. What we believe. I am running to offer our country a different path – not back to a past that never was, but to a future that fulfills our true potential as a country.
1144396024716378113 2019-06-27 17:04:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> We know in our bones this election is different. We have a president who promotes hate and division. Encourages white supremacists. Embraces dictators. And damages our alliances internationally.  Our politics traffics in division. And our president is the divider in chief.
1144395129593221120 2019-06-27 17:00:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> In an hour, I’ll take the stage for the first Democratic debate to discuss my vision for the country. As I’ve said from day one, I’m running for president for three reasons: to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild its backbone — the middle class, and unify all Americans.
1144357988523659264 2019-06-27 14:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> From day one, we've refused to take money from any corporate PACs or lobbyists. Today, I’m building on that base by signing @NoFossilMoney’s pledge to reject support from the PACs, lobbyists, or executives of fossil fuel companies.  I work for you — not any industry.  https://t.co/f8HxB89F9V
1144318981681090562 2019-06-27 11:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In America, every worker deserves fair treatment, safe workplaces, and the right to join a union. Period. I’m proud to stand in solidarity with airport workers across the country as they strike for their right to organize. #RespectUSworkers
1144287755276607490 2019-06-27 09:53:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today’s decision from the court hopefully means there will not be a question on the 2020 Census, but we have much more work to do to ensure all voices are heard in our democracy.
1144287754395815936 2019-06-27 09:53:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> Make no mistake, the Trump Administration added a citizenship question to the Census to deliberately cut out the voices of immigrants and communities of color. It’s wrong and goes against our core values as a nation.
1144277961287147520 2019-06-27 09:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today the Supreme Court refused to stop politicians rigging our democracy by writing election rules for their own benefit. It couldn’t have happened without Justices put there by Donald Trump and Republicans — another reason why Democrats must take back the White House in 2020.
1144032702636548096 2019-06-26 17:00:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> I was proud to sign @IndivisibleTeam’s pledge. Our large and diverse set of qualified Democratic candidates is evidence of our strength as a party, and I am committed to supporting whomever becomes the nominee. The most important thing is to beat Donald Trump. Period.
1143975971638435843 2019-06-26 13:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> All marriages, at their root, are about love. And four years ago, the Supreme Court affirmed that simple proposition in Obergefell v. Hodges. Thank you to the generations of LGBTQ trailblazers who refused to bend before the voices of intolerance. Your courage changed the world.
1143956090108837888 2019-06-26 11:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This image is gut-wrenching. The cruelty we're seeing at our border is unconscionable. History will judge how we respond to the Trump Administration’s treatment of immigrant families &amp; children—we can’t be silent. This isn't who we are. This is not America. https://t.co/ZeMBmwUHxU
1143940739480657920 2019-06-26 10:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> One year ago, the Supreme Court upheld Trump's Muslim ban—one of this administration's most egregious attacks on our core values. Wielding the politics of fear and intolerance by slandering entire religious communities as complicit in terrorism is wrong, and it’s not who we are.
1143915573480435714 2019-06-26 09:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> DREAMers are Americans, and Congress needs to make it official. The millions of DREAMers and undocumented individuals in the United States can only be brought out of the shadows through fair treatment, not ugly threats.
1143663411680534529 2019-06-25 16:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In two days, I’ll take the stage for the first Democratic debate to discuss my vision for the country. If you haven’t yet, RSVP to attend a watch party in your community today:  https://t.co/ai8Gixr1tV  https://t.co/o5pV6OJN76
1143628431285874688 2019-06-25 14:14:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need to face the facts on climate change: it’s an existential threat and it’s already here. Few cities know that better than Miami.   We must take urgent action to tackle the climate crisis today.  https://t.co/H1a3brFr1N
1143603707625558018 2019-06-25 12:35:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> Add your name to call on Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act and make every American's voice equal, once and for all. #RestoreTheVote  https://t.co/CoEvHyLljj
1143603265625567232 2019-06-25 12:34:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Civil rights was one of the things that got me engaged in politics. Six years after Shelby County v. Holder, voting rights are under attack across the country. And that’s one of the reasons I’m running for president today.  We must renew our efforts to protect the right to vote.  https://t.co/IXrZ8dJWRq
1143538841212588032 2019-06-25 08:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must secure our borders, but “build the wall” is a slogan divorced from reality. We need to focus on improving screening procedures at our legal ports of entry &amp; making smart investments in border technology. These policies will do more for our security than a wall ever could.
1143242251272970240 2019-06-24 12:39:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@GabbyGiffords’ dedication to making our communities safer continues to be an inspiration. I join her in urging the Senate to vote on #BackgroundChecksNow. We must take on the @NRA and end the epidemic of gun violence in our country.
1143216718690574342 2019-06-24 10:58:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you for a great weekend, South Carolina!  https://t.co/YCsyW66KzG
1143185764458487808 2019-06-24 08:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump sólo está interesado en políticas que atacan la dignidad de la comunidad Latina y asustan a los votantes para que se presenten en las urnas el día de las elecciones, sin interés por abordar los desafíos reales que enfrenta nuestro hemisferio.  https://t.co/YEXsBZizKK
1143153049159864325 2019-06-24 06:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s clear Trump is only interested in using his policies to assault the dignity of the Hispanic community and scare voters to turn out on Election Day, while not addressing the real challenges facing our hemisphere.  Read my full op-ed here:  https://t.co/9dl3ADpBf3
1142908940814114817 2019-06-23 14:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re bringing together supporters across the country for the first Democratic debate! Head to  https://t.co/r0RlGWdvLe to RSVP to a watch party in your community.  https://t.co/D86yUQXU7y
1142849800473157632 2019-06-23 10:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Trump Administration is arguing in the 9th Circuit that migrant children held in detention centers without soap, toothbrushes or beds are in conditions that are “safe and sanitary”.  It’s an all-out assault on human dignity and our standards as a nation. We must do better.
1142605692085272581 2019-06-22 18:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump’s erratic, impulsive actions are the last thing we need as Commander-in-Chief. No president should order a military strike without fully understanding the consequences. We don’t need another war in the Middle East, but Trump’s actions toward Iran only make that more likely.
1142560944729612289 2019-06-22 15:32:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> Planned Parenthood helps women and individuals get the health care they need — especially preventive services like cancer screenings, mammograms, checkups, and contraception.  Thank you to @PPact for having me at today’s #WeDecide Forum to discuss these important issues.  https://t.co/6P5MoAJ39V
1142560939406962688 2019-06-22 15:32:10 -0800 <JoeBiden> I support @PPact because women and transgender individuals' health care is essential. Historically, women — and particularly women of color — have been put in a position where they cannot access health care, in a more extreme way more than any other part of the population.
1142454669740060673 2019-06-22 08:29:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s always great to be back at the #ClyburnFishFry. Thank you to @ClyburnSC06 and everyone who came out for a great night!  https://t.co/SMkY7XgZ7L
1142121250275438597 2019-06-21 10:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump continues to deny the scientific evidence in front of his own eyes and attack the progress we’ve made on climate change. It’s unacceptable.   In a Biden Administration, we’ll turbocharge our efforts to achieve a 100% clean energy economy.  https://t.co/6WLinHjje2
1141849459556532224 2019-06-20 16:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Climate change poses an existential threat to our communities, economy, national security, and environment. Our plan for a Clean Energy Revolution &amp; Environmental Justice will address the climate emergency &amp; protect our communities for generations to come.  https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo
1141836876162068480 2019-06-20 15:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have to take on the epidemic of violence against the transgender community — especially trans women of color. Ten trans women have been killed violently in 2019 so far.  We must stand up, speak out, and put an end to this hate.  https://t.co/FxW38cG6xQ
1141760624361451521 2019-06-20 10:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This month marks 50 years since a movement was born on Christopher Street — a movement that has delivered so much acceptance &amp; hope &amp; pride for the LGBTQ community. I stopped by @TheStonewallNYC to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the uprising that changed our world forever.  https://t.co/i2ShQVIKjm
1141722710449500160 2019-06-20 08:01:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> What we need is presidential leadership that will take strategic action to counter the Iranian threat, restore America's standing in the world, recognize the value of principled diplomacy, and strengthen our nation and our security by working strategically with our allies.
1141722709220646912 2019-06-20 08:01:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> Make no mistake: Iran continues to be a bad actor that abuses human rights and supports terrorist activities throughout the region.
1141722708159401984 2019-06-20 08:01:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s sadly ironic that the State Department is now calling on Iran to abide by the very deal the Trump Administration abandoned.  By walking away from diplomacy, Trump has made military conflict more likely. Another war in the Middle East is the last thing we need.
1141722707312164865 2019-06-20 08:01:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> But they’ve only gotten more aggressive. Trump also promised that walking away would somehow lead to a better deal – instead, the predictable has happened: Iran is building back up its nuclear capability.
1141722706251067392 2019-06-20 08:01:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> He unilaterally withdrew from the hard-won nuclear agreement that the Obama-Biden Administration negotiated to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Trump promised that abandoning the deal and imposing sanctions would stop Iran’s aggression in the region.
1141722705038905348 2019-06-20 08:01:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump's Iran strategy is a self-inflicted disaster. Two of America's vital interests in the Middle East are preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and securing a stable energy supply through the Strait of Hormuz. Trump is failing on both counts.
1141483368720322560 2019-06-19 16:10:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> As we recognize Juneteenth and the progress we’ve made since slavery, we must also double down on our efforts to root out systemic racism. We have to make sure we’re working to move closer to that more perfect union, to the idea of America that has inspired so many generations.
1141483367696912389 2019-06-19 16:10:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> America was founded on the ideals of equality, equity, &amp; fairness—but has failed to live up to that promise for all people. In 2019, the unemployment rate for black people is almost twice that of white people. Children born poor are twice as likely to stay poor if they’re black.
1141467164148416516 2019-06-19 15:05:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump’s policies appear intentionally designed to aggravate the situation to scare Americans into re-electing him. Cutting off aid to Central America will increase migration to our Southern border, not reduce it.
1141467162936250368 2019-06-19 15:05:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump threatening the mass deportation of immigrants is cruel and un-American. We can fix our broken immigration system and enforce our laws without tossing aside our values.  https://t.co/0NE6CitDKM
1141157275257753600 2019-06-18 18:34:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is truly the most important election of our lifetime. If we want to defeat Donald Trump, it’s going to take everyone stepping up, speaking out, and taking action.  Join our team today and let’s get to work:  https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW
1141157274498605056 2019-06-18 18:34:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump’s response to Charlottesville two years ago was abhorrent, but it’s not just that. It’s happening every day. Separating children from their parents at the border. Attacking women's rights. Rolling back LGBTQ protections.   We’re better than this.
1141157273701625857 2019-06-18 18:34:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump continues to undermine our standing in the world.  Our core values of inclusivity, diversity, respect for the rule of law, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion are under attack here at home and abroad.
1141149987432226816 2019-06-18 18:05:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> Just look at his tax plan.  As president, Biden will reverse Trump’s tax cuts for the super wealthy. It’s time we reward work, not just wealth.  https://t.co/byDWQAumwg
1141149986505330693 2019-06-18 18:05:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s be clear: President Trump inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden administration. And now, he’s in the process of squandering it.
1141149985821605888 2019-06-18 18:05:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hey there - @TeamJoe here. President Trump dismisses everything he doesn’t want to hear as “FAKE NEWS” -- so as he announces his re-election, we want to make sure you have the real facts on his record:
1141083160119250944 2019-06-18 13:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> For all the hard-won progress, for as much as we can celebrate how much better things have gotten — this fight is not over.  We have to come together to stand up to abuses of power, ensure that everyone is treated with dignity, and fight for full equality.  https://t.co/aCoWE0hggC
1141077119969067008 2019-06-18 13:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Stopped by @TheStonewallNYC to celebrate #PrideMonth &amp; #WorldPride where the movement began 50 years ago.  https://t.co/2Z4PyfzyOq
1141055438336745473 2019-06-18 11:49:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s past time for a $15 minimum wage.
1141013954577260546 2019-06-18 09:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ll be taking the stage at 9PM ET on June 27 for the first Democratic debate!  We’re organizing debate watch parties in every corner of the country for the big night and need your help. Sign up to host one in your community:  https://t.co/3TRBR6Fz8i
1140988787863855107 2019-06-18 07:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This weekend, I’m heading to South Carolina for the @SCDP Convention and world-famous #ClyburnFishFry! RSVP to come out and join us:  https://t.co/r0RlGVVUmE
1140771355266187264 2019-06-17 17:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Under President Trump’s policies, a four-month-old was separated from his family at the border. It’s unconscionable and fundamentally at odds with everything our nation stands for.  America is better than this.  https://t.co/hQY3xISf7r
1140743421172363267 2019-06-17 15:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Happy anniversary to the love of my life and the life of my love, @DrBiden. I’m forever grateful you agreed to spend the rest of your life with me. I love you, Jilly!  https://t.co/HwCQIjFc4J
1140727535510138880 2019-06-17 14:06:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> It will also include premium-free access to this public option for people who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid, but have been denied access to it by governors and state legislatures who have refused the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion.
1140727534679728130 2019-06-17 14:06:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> Lastly, I discussed how my health care plan will include access to a Medicare-like public option for anyone who wants it.
1140727533794709506 2019-06-17 14:06:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> I declared that we have to do everything we can to protect the most sacred, fundamental right we have: the right to vote.
1140727532800630784 2019-06-17 14:06:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> I discussed how in a Biden Administration, we’ll support teachers and ensure every kid has access to a quality education. Because in America, no child’s future should be determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability.  https://t.co/d1o4WnDczV
1140727531630473222 2019-06-17 14:06:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> I talked about how the greatest sin is the abuse of power — whether economic, or physical, or social. And, it’s our duty to fight back against those who would abuse it.  That starts with access to a real living wage — a $15 minimum wage.
1140727530640609281 2019-06-17 14:06:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> I was honored to join @UniteThePoor, @RevDrBarber, and @liztheo at today’s #PPCMoralCongress Presidential Forum.
1140710957645275136 2019-06-17 13:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, I took @EricHolder's @demredistrict pledge to support #FairMaps. For too long, gerrymandering has allowed politicians to pick who they represent. That’s wrong. I’m committed to fair redistricting where elected officials are accountable to those they represent.
1140692334855774209 2019-06-17 11:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Four years ago, a white supremacist walked into "Mother Emanuel" and gunned down nine brave souls, including my friend Clementa Pinckney. It's not enough to remember them. We have to fight for them. We are in a battle for the soul of this nation.
1140373232207507456 2019-06-16 14:39:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> 7 years ago, @BarackObama and I offered security to DREAMers, young people brought here as kids who only know America as home. Trump is trying to break our country's promise to them &amp; continues to threaten their status.  DREAMers are Americans. It’s time we kept our word to them.
1140285403552997379 2019-06-16 08:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Good luck to the @USWNT as they take on Chile!   As we cheer them on in the World Cup, we must support their fight off the field for equal pay. In 2019, it’s past time we close the pay gap and ensure women get paid as much as men. #OneNationOneTeam  https://t.co/bJQZm2aQMv
1140197324917895168 2019-06-16 03:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As my father believed, there’s no higher calling for a woman or a man than to be a good mother or a good father. Happy Father’s Day to all the dads out there who work every day to help raise their children—and all our children—to be honorable, generous, kind young men and women.  https://t.co/6B8hbfOIft
1139960764016365569 2019-06-15 11:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers, CEOs, or hedge fund managers. It was built by the American middle class. It’s time we recognize that.  We’ve got to build an economy and a tax code that rewards work, not just wealth.
1139916723748950016 2019-06-15 08:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In America, no child’s future should be determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability. In a Biden Administration, we’ll invest in our students, schools, and educators to ensure every kid gets a fair shot.  Read the plan here:  https://t.co/d1o4WnUNrt
1139563899533946880 2019-06-14 09:03:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> The extraordinary bravery shown by hundreds of thousands in Hong Kong, marching for the civil liberties &amp; autonomy promised by China is inspiring. And the world is watching. All of us must stand in support of democratic principles and freedom.
1139543628408328192 2019-06-14 07:42:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is simple. No candidate running for office should help foreign governments undermine our democracy. That includes the sitting President of the United States. Our elections should be decided by the American people — not Vladimir Putin.
1139473225342214144 2019-06-14 03:02:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> Donald Trump doesn’t think it matters if candidates accept damaging intel on their opponent from a foreign government. He’s dead wrong.  That’s why I’m signing the Pledge for Election Integrity. I refuse to help those who seek to undermine our democracy.  https://t.co/Zw7DKYXc1h  https://t.co/3NGezt58hx
1139360810738704384 2019-06-13 19:36:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every worker in this country deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages and benefits — and the right to collectively bargain. I’m proud to stand with Detroit security officers today as they fight for a $15 minimum wage and union rights. #OneDetroit
1139212081314422784 2019-06-13 09:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Had great pancakes and great conversation at Tasty Cafe in Eldridge before heading to Clinton Community College for our final event this trip. Thank you for a great few days, Iowa!  https://t.co/gONhYR1gRf
1139188173131591685 2019-06-13 08:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I have nothing against Amazon, but no company pulling in billions of dollars of profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers. We need to reward work, not just wealth.  https://t.co/R6xaN3vXGT
1138982419527327745 2019-06-12 18:32:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump is once again welcoming foreign interference in our elections. This isn’t about politics. It is a threat to our national security. An American President should not seek their aid and abet those who seek to undermine democracy.
1138937521545420800 2019-06-12 15:34:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We had a great day in Iowa talking about how we rebuild the backbone of our country — the middle class. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us!  https://t.co/49jUzP89F1
1138906064647327744 2019-06-12 13:29:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today in 1967, the Supreme Court struck down interracial marriage bans in Loving v. Virginia—a decision that inched us closer to our founding ideals of equality, equity, &amp; fairness.  The decision reminds us progress doesn’t happen on its own—every generation has to fight for it.
1138891429026177024 2019-06-12 12:30:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our 9/11 first responders represent the best of our country — selflessly rushing into danger to save others. We owe them so much, and the least we can do is provide the health care and benefits they deserve.   Thank you, Jon Stewart, for continuing to have their backs.
1138877726692188160 2019-06-12 11:36:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> Prayers are not enough to end these senseless mass shootings. This violence is not normal. As a country, we have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to stop the gun violence epidemic.
1138877722682363904 2019-06-12 11:36:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> Three years later, the horrific attack on Pulse Nightclub still shakes our nation to the core. A night that should have been a celebration of love and life was cut short by unspeakable terror. Today, we remember those we lost — including so many in the LGBTQ community.  https://t.co/vdNyZEjlRr
1138614392508100608 2019-06-11 18:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump thinks his tariffs are being paid by China. Just like he thinks Mexico is building the wall.
1138588219866378240 2019-06-11 16:26:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tomorrow, we’re heading to Clinton, Iowa, and hope to see you there! RSVP at  https://t.co/MwCakzlMdm and spread the word to family and friends.
1138536524381851648 2019-06-11 13:00:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump is bringing his secret one page agreement with Mexico to Iowa. The Iowans being crushed by his tariffs would like to see it.
1138517503909306368 2019-06-11 11:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Good luck to the @USWNT as they kick off their first game of the Women’s World Cup. @DrBiden and I will be rooting for you! We have no doubt you’ll make our country proud. #OneNationOneTeam  https://t.co/BCtOFAtSRt
1138511521800249344 2019-06-11 11:21:13 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you for following along this afternoon! Follow @TeamJoe to keep up with everything happening on the campaign. #TeamJoe
1138506630289678401 2019-06-11 11:01:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t afford four more years of an administration that gambles with the livelihoods of American families. Working families deserve a president who is fighting for them. #TeamJoe
1138506137697959939 2019-06-11 10:59:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump doesn’t get the basics. He thinks his tariffs are being paid by China. Any freshman econ student could tell you that the American people are paying his tariffs.  The cashiers at Target see what’s going on – they know more about economics than Trump. #TeamJoe
1138505591742259202 2019-06-11 10:57:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> He thinks he’s being tough. Well, it’s easy to be tough when someone else is feeling the pain. How many farmers across Iowa and across this nation are facing the prospect of losing their business, of losing their farm because of Trump’s tariffs? #TeamJoe
1138505405284409349 2019-06-11 10:56:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tune in here:  https://t.co/4rTMVjJzyb
1138505090275389442 2019-06-11 10:55:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> When it comes to President Trump’s tariff war with China, one thing is clear: America’s farmers and manufacturers are getting crushed – no one knows that better than Iowa.   To Trump, the people getting hurt are just pawns in his game. #TeamJoe
1138504076788936706 2019-06-11 10:51:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hey everyone, @TeamJoe here. We’re taking over to keep you in the loop on our event in Ottumwa, Iowa. Stay tuned! #TeamJoe
1138215765843283969 2019-06-10 15:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm headed to eastern Iowa this week to talk with voters about our vision for the future. Head to  https://t.co/r0RlGWdvLe to RSVP to an event in your community.
1138146307921465346 2019-06-10 11:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It was great to be back in Atlanta! Thank you to Mayor @KeishaBottoms for showing me around town and for your work expanding opportunity to every corner of the city.  https://t.co/kmhmeN5lHm
1138091446945214464 2019-06-10 07:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> President Trump’s decision to abandon the #ParisAgreement wasn't just reckless—it abdicated our leadership on the world stage and threatened the future of our planet.   On day one, I’ll rejoin the Agreement and rally the world to push our progress further.  https://t.co/0Wxk0RIYvs
1137818649207721984 2019-06-09 13:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill &amp; I were thrilled to be there today to watch our amazing granddaughter Maisy graduate. Maisy, you make us so proud &amp; we can’t wait to see what you do next with your talent, smarts, dedication and kindness. The future is yours, and Nana &amp; Pop will always be right behind you.  https://t.co/zj80Kee4l3
1137786437108228096 2019-06-09 11:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As president, I’ll lead America to become the world’s clean energy superpower.   https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo  https://t.co/rzeIcuW9BW
1137536458770780160 2019-06-08 18:46:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> Happy birthday to one of the strongest people Jill and I know, @GabbyGiffords. You are an inspiration to so many people. Your courage and your advocacy have made our country a better place.
1137521124793823232 2019-06-08 17:45:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> Happy #BestFriendsDay to my friend, @BarackObama.  https://t.co/JTd1t7NtyL
1137512532845969409 2019-06-08 17:11:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Bidens are celebrating my daughter Ashley’s birthday today. @DrBiden and I are so proud of everything she has accomplished and can’t wait to see what she achieves in the years ahead.  https://t.co/XlUZHSBMKp
1137427069355339776 2019-06-08 11:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Across America, mayors are stepping up and leading the way on combating climate change. Thank you to @MartyForBoston for showing me the innovative work Boston is doing to protect the city from rising sea levels and increased flooding.  https://t.co/LZKp6WNWlj
1137415744633954310 2019-06-08 10:47:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Iowa, we’re heading your way next week and hope to see you there! Go to  https://t.co/r0RlGWdvLe to RSVP to an event in your community.
1137372459311751168 2019-06-08 07:55:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Make no mistake, how we act in the next 12 years will determine the very livability of our planet. We’ll make the largest investment in American history to tackle the climate emergency head on and protect our planet for future generations.  https://t.co/XJsdFWUo9j
1137143450372120577 2019-06-07 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> This campaign is about listening to communities and working with them to find solutions to the issues on their minds. Yesterday we held a roundtable to do just that.  Thank you to everyone who shared their stories with me in Atlanta.  https://t.co/xSyn19iT7L
1137118388826890240 2019-06-07 15:05:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know how to beat the NRA because I’ve done it before - twice. I shepherded through the passage of the Brady background check bill in 1993, and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in 1994. As president, I will defeat the NRA again.
1137118387413426178 2019-06-07 15:05:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t let a special interest group dictate the safety of the rest of the country. That’s why defeating the NRA is a key element of our education policy we introduced last week.
1137118386515775488 2019-06-07 15:05:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> We will be rolling out policies to reduce gun violence in the coming months, but it’s clear we need to:  - Close the loophole that allows individuals to buy guns online or at gun shows without a background check. - Ban the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
1137118385769197568 2019-06-07 15:05:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> There are actions that Congress can take right now if they were to listen to the majority of the American people who want to see our government take action to stop gun violence.
1137118384905211904 2019-06-07 15:05:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> We don't need to convince the American public that common-sense measures to reduce gun violence are a good idea. 2 in 3 people believe that we need stricter gun laws.
1137118384045404161 2019-06-07 15:05:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is politics at its worst. We should all feel safe to walk the streets of our own cities and towns. Our workers should feel safe at work. Our students should always feel safe at school.
1137118383311327236 2019-06-07 15:05:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need action. But the NRA and gun manufacturers have such a firm grip on Republicans in Congress that they refuse to consider common-sense gun reforms.
1137118382245974020 2019-06-07 15:05:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today is #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay. Our team, and people across the country, are wearing orange in remembrance of the countless lives that have been cut short by senseless acts of gun violence in America.
1136798174855610368 2019-06-06 17:53:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Women’s rights and health care are under assault in a way that seeks to roll back every step of progress we’ve made over the last 50 years. If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone’s zip code.
1136662800493924352 2019-06-06 08:55:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, we honor all those who answered duty’s call on June 6, 1944, not only in memorials and remembrances, but in recommitting ourselves to the urgent task of defending those values for which they fought and so many died.
1136662798904303617 2019-06-06 08:55:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> Their valor cemented in history their place of honor and it planted the seeds of what would grow to become the greatest military alliance in the history of the world—one that would preserve the peace and extend the hard won gains of democracy for their children and grandchildren.
1136662798199660544 2019-06-06 08:55:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> We will never forget what the conviction and mettle of those young patriots achieved—for all of us.
1136662796974854144 2019-06-06 08:55:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> With uncommon courage and unfailing honor, Allied forces claimed the first few feet in the drive to turn back an empire born of hatred and prevent it from consuming Europe. They did it not for personal posterity or political gain, but simply because there was no other choice.
1136662796073152519 2019-06-06 08:55:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> 75 years ago, far from home, on those bloody beachheads of Normandy, thousands of brave young Americans risked everything to prove that freedom, justice, and democracy would never bend before the forces of fascism and intolerance.
1136407853479202816 2019-06-05 16:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t afford four more years of President Trump attacking the progress we’ve made on climate change. On day one as president, I’ll take the bold action necessary to tackle this crisis head on.  https://t.co/PTXHzn1PXM
1136393508648972288 2019-06-05 15:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We had a great few days on the campaign trail in New Hampshire. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us! I look forward to being back soon.  https://t.co/oQA6EhBT5f
1136348713595654146 2019-06-05 12:07:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Spent yesterday afternoon in Plymouth, NH, discussing how we build our Clean Energy Revolution. Under our bold new plan, the United States will be a 100% clean-energy economy with net-zero emissions by 2050.  Read more here:  https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo  https://t.co/DAtLNjqdfI
1136035902306865152 2019-06-04 15:24:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> As the sun sets around the world, Jill and I want to extend our warmest wishes to those marking the end of Ramadan. May your celebrations be filled with family and joy. #EidMubarak
1135992455931813888 2019-06-04 12:31:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> Estamos enfrentando una emergencia climática y debemos tomar medidas drásticas ya. Por eso, hoy, estoy anunciando mi plan para una Revolución de Energía Limpia y Justicia Ambiental.  https://t.co/QcC4JKSkvj
1135982349424963585 2019-06-04 11:51:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> China’s continuing oppression of its own people, especially the abuse and internment of more than one million Uyghurs, is one of the worst human rights crises in the world today. It can’t be ignored. Human rights must be at the core—not periphery—of our engagement in the world.
1135982348741332992 2019-06-04 11:51:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today is the anniversary of China's brutal crackdown in Tiananmen Square. Authorities tried to stop peaceful calls for political change with rifles &amp; tanks. The courage of the Tiananmen generation hasn't been silenced &amp; still inspires the fight for freedom and justice worldwide.
1135944335738966016 2019-06-04 09:20:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> Making these revolutionary changes is going to take an incredible commitment at all levels, but I know we can meet this challenge.  Because this is what America does best—solving big problems, with big ideas. If you agree, please sign your name here:  https://t.co/Fn5XTDtfQZ
1135943828274327557 2019-06-04 09:18:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need to dramatically accelerate our worldwide effort to meet the intensity of the challenge we face. I hope you'll read my full plan to tackle the climate emergency and environmental injustices:   https://t.co/XJsdFWUo9j
1135942834194964488 2019-06-04 09:14:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> I will rejoin the Paris Climate Accord on Day One. But that’s not sufficient.  I’ll immediately get to work leading a diplomatic initiative to get every nation to go beyond their initial commitment—to push our progress further, and faster.   https://t.co/Fn5XTDtfQZ  https://t.co/x8X0qhu8qZ
1135940944879128576 2019-06-04 09:06:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’ll hold polluters accountable for the damage they've caused—particularly in low-income communities and communities of color.   https://t.co/XZ0tkRzgl2  https://t.co/irrXklh9PF
1135939218302222338 2019-06-04 08:59:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> This initiative will create new, good-paying jobs all across the clean economy in the United States of America. It’s an enormous opportunity.   https://t.co/2sXQy4kQ1J  https://t.co/jMzUjmXwoV
1135936833848786945 2019-06-04 08:50:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re going to make record-breaking investments in research and development and zero-carbon technologies so that America is the engine of the world’s clean economy.  The United States will be a 100% clean-energy economy with net-zero emissions by 2050.   https://t.co/Fn5XTDtfQZ  https://t.co/ypw4o7rozG
1135935107041300482 2019-06-04 08:43:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> Science tells us that how we act, or fail to act, in the next 12 years will determine the very livability of our planet. As president, I will use every authority available to me to drive progress.  I will accept no half-measures.  https://t.co/Fn5XTDtfQZ
1135934101549174784 2019-06-04 08:39:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, President Trump denies the evidence in front of his own eyes, hides climate science produced by his own administration, and actively works to roll back what progress we have already made.  It’s reckless, it’s irresponsible, and it’s unacceptable.  https://t.co/3r9TqKKqGQ
1135848669918486529 2019-06-04 03:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are in a climate emergency and we must take drastic action now to address it. So today, I’m announcing my plan for a Clean Energy Revolution and Environmental Justice.   https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo  https://t.co/SBDrdiFu2C
1135606069722460160 2019-06-03 10:56:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We have a major problem with educational inequality and we need to tackle it head on. In a Biden Administration, we’ll triple Title I funding — creating a historic investment in schools serving a high proportion of children from low-income families.  https://t.co/14A6BoG428
1135575368050577408 2019-06-03 08:54:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Happy birthday to the love of my life and the life of my love, @DrBiden. Jilly, I love you.  https://t.co/WFwlUCuowv
1135198225890193408 2019-06-02 07:55:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m looking forward to traveling to New Hampshire this week to talk to voters about my plans for our country.   RSVP to join us in Berlin or Concord today:  https://t.co/VfNnVHbcqP
1135015405859299329 2019-06-01 19:48:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you @HRC for having me tonight in Columbus. At a time when we’re seeing the forces of hate and intolerance push back on the progress we’ve made, your courage and grit gives me hope. I will always stand beside you as we fight for equality.
1134937162452017152 2019-06-01 14:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Gun violence occurs every day across America. Enough is enough. Not every life lost makes national headlines, but it's just as painful for those left behind. This is an epidemic plaguing our communities &amp; destroying our children’s futures. We must act now.  https://t.co/PYAHoAFmjQ
1134922883191508995 2019-06-01 13:41:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> Pride is about standing up to the voices of injustice and discrimination and declaring that everyone has the right to live proud, open, and free. It's about love. We join the LGBTQ community in celebration and remember the fight is not over. We march on. Happy #PrideMonth
1134644168658231297 2019-05-31 19:13:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> 11 innocent lives cut down. 11 more futures denied. When will we finally say enough is enough? It’s long past time to hold our leaders accountable. Jill and I are heartbroken that more American families are suffering tonight in Virginia Beach.
1134581569786695681 2019-05-31 15:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> America’s teachers have been forced to make ends meet with too little pay and too few resources. That changes with a Biden Administration. We’ll finally support our educators with the pay and dignity they deserve.  https://t.co/Rvl0MkS0XF
1134521171721052164 2019-05-31 11:05:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> One in five children experience mental health challenges, but too many don’t get help. My plan doubles the number of mental health professionals in schools to ensure every student gets the support they need.  Read the full plan here:  https://t.co/d1o4WnDczV  https://t.co/03B7c9Zza7
1134498619778899968 2019-05-31 09:35:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every day, we’re witnessing the Trump Administration attack the hard fought progress made by the LGBTQ community. We can't go backwards. It's up to all of us to stand up to these injustices. I'm looking forward to joining @HRC tomorrow to talk about the work that remains.
1134255673410064384 2019-05-30 17:30:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thad Cochran was a friend and a true patriot in every sense of the word. Jill and I are sending our condolences to Thad’s family, he will be sorely missed.
1134248373744164865 2019-05-30 17:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I were honored to join today’s Memorial Day service in Delaware. We must remember the brave women and men — and their families — who gave everything in service to our nation.  https://t.co/h1B0JMNzT4
1134241402525749259 2019-05-30 16:33:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> @KamalaHarris @DrBiden Thank you @KamalaHarris from me, Jill, &amp; all the Bidens for your kind remembrance of Beau today.   My dad used to say that you know you are a success as a parent when you turn &amp; look at your child &amp; realize they turned out better than you — I'm so proud of the man Beau became.
1134211380377260037 2019-05-30 14:34:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’ve got to invest in every child — regardless of zip code or race or parents' income. In a Biden Administration, we’ll provide high-quality, universal pre-K for all three- and four-year-olds to ensure every kid gets a fair shot.  Read the full plan:  https://t.co/d1o4WnDczV  https://t.co/aKBwTe8bJO
1134181199918841856 2019-05-30 12:34:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> South Carolina would be lucky to have @harrisonjaime representing them in the Senate. He has the character, intelligence, and integrity needed to serve his community well. I hope you'll #JoinJaime.
1133882123276967936 2019-05-29 16:45:39 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our motivated students make me believe America’s best days are still ahead. Thank you to Mayor @Mike_Rawlings and @SPARKDallas for a great afternoon.  https://t.co/vqKIVQu7I4
1133818793891913728 2019-05-29 12:34:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We had a great first day in Texas! Thank you to @rweingarten and @AFTunion for the discussion on how we improve our education system. It's time we increase teacher pay and ensure that no child’s future is determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability.  https://t.co/qnghcHg2Y9
1133531926642470913 2019-05-28 17:34:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> There is no doubt in my mind that if we take these steps, no nation on earth will be able to match the United States of America.  To read more about our plan, head to  https://t.co/d1o4WnDczV.
1133531921122779137 2019-05-28 17:34:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our children are our future, it’s time we start investing in them from birth.  https://t.co/WkDxxamJlT
1133531911668867073 2019-05-28 17:34:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s our responsibility to provide every middle and high school student a path to a successful career.  https://t.co/SlVRJSuw68
1133531898247045120 2019-05-28 17:33:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> In America, no child’s future should be determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability.  https://t.co/Q43YWyq6K8
1133531887203475456 2019-05-28 17:33:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must invest in our public schools so students can grow into healthy adults and educators can focus on teaching.  https://t.co/f6xHzfTq8o
1133531875597799425 2019-05-28 17:33:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s time we give our educators the pay and dignity they deserve.  https://t.co/Hzhr7jZF4t
1133531869214060546 2019-05-28 17:33:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our plan will increase teacher pay and provide them with the support they deserve. We’ll invest in all children from birth, so that regardless of their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability they are prepared to succeed in tomorrow’s economy.
1133488485619437568 2019-05-28 14:41:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve seen firsthand how hard teachers work with little support and few resources. We’ve got to do better. That’s why today, surrounded by America’s teachers, we laid out our plan for educators, students, and our future:  https://t.co/d1o4WnDczV.  https://t.co/6UxCx8bvjb
1133432497872756737 2019-05-28 10:59:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Teachers like Ronniece are not only educating our children — they’re building the future of our country.  https://t.co/Jr1Qf84sfq
1133010215413080064 2019-05-27 07:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every #MemorialDay, Jill and I remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice in service of our nation. Our troops are the heart, soul, &amp; spine of America—may we never fail to honor the memory of those who have fallen and ensure their spirit lives on in both our words and deeds.
1132770888305303555 2019-05-26 15:10:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Everybody knows who Donald Trump is, we have to let them know who we are. We choose hope over fear. Truth over lies. And unity over division.  https://t.co/X2eLN3xe7M
1132716782295408646 2019-05-26 11:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m running to offer our country a different path. Not back to a past that never was, but to a future that lives up to our founding ideals and fulfills our true promise as a country. If you’re with me, join our campaign today:  https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW
1132383084446281728 2019-05-25 13:29:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Across the country, too many families are being left behind. We’ve got to rebuild an inclusive middle class where everybody — regardless of race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability — gets a fair shot.  https://t.co/KXmcK0tluD
1132343069355991040 2019-05-25 10:50:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> With so much happening on the campaign, we want to make sure you’re up-to-date on the latest news. Text JOIN right now to 30330 to make sure you don’t miss a thing!
1132296512224894976 2019-05-25 07:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let me make one thing clear, the promise of this nation will not be extinguished on my watch.  https://t.co/2v21dxil7K
1132017423312252929 2019-05-24 13:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I can promise you this: I will do whatever it takes to make progress on the issues that matter most.  https://t.co/Ta7066wGlB
1131686241693573121 2019-05-23 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know how to make government work — not because I’ve talked or tweeted about it. But because I’ve done it.  https://t.co/gHn7DJP4pO
1131648787418685440 2019-05-23 12:51:10 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m proud to stand with @SEIU and workers across the country today in the #FightFor15. We must restore the dignity of work and ensure everyone’s treated with respect. That starts with raising the minimum wage to $15, strengthening our unions, and creating safe work environments.
1131545449201061889 2019-05-23 06:00:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> Over the last year, six children have tragically died in US custody at the border. It’s unacceptable. It’s not who we are. And silence is complicity. It’s on all of us to stand up and speak out. America is a nation of immigrants. We must guarantee everyone's treated with dignity.
1131355813757374465 2019-05-22 17:27:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On Saturday, we officially kicked off our campaign in Philadelphia — the city that brought our nation together over 200 years ago. I’m running for president to unite our country, because when we come together and act as one America there’s nothing we can’t accomplish.  https://t.co/syRNWo5c6i
1131339456399781891 2019-05-22 16:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the 25 years since we passed the Violence Against Women Act, we’ve made great strides in protecting women from abuse. But the latest reauthorization is being held up by the @NRA. It’s outrageous. This shouldn’t be a partisan issue—the Senate should pass the #VAWA immediately.
1130982857172766720 2019-05-21 16:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our politics today has become so mean and petty — it traffics in division and our president is the divider in chief. This is not who we are.  https://t.co/M8geqIO5P0
1130956684136857600 2019-05-21 15:01:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We were born of an idea that every single person — no matter where they come from — can achieve anything if they work at it.  https://t.co/uczQ2fBRM6
1130931543856287744 2019-05-21 13:21:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> That’s why I’ve spent my whole career fighting — and I will continue to fight — like hell so that no one ever has to make that walk again.  If you’re with me, I hope you'll join my campaign and chip in what you can:  https://t.co/JUJoxV4KiD
1130931542434439173 2019-05-21 13:21:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> My dad had to make that walk in Scranton, Pennsylvania. It wasn’t until I was older that I realized how hard it must have been for him.  But he was not alone. This story isn’t unique to the Bidens. Too many people around this country have had to make that walk.
1130931541377474561 2019-05-21 13:21:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> And he doesn’t understand that the longest walk a parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to their child’s bedroom to say, honey, I'm sorry. We have to move. You can’t go back to your school. You won’t see your friends because Daddy or Mommy lost their job.
1130931540542787585 2019-05-21 13:21:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> Trump doesn’t understand the struggles working folks go through. He doesn’t understand what it’s like to worry you will lose the roof over your head. He doesn’t understand what it’s like to wonder if you’ll be able to put food on the table.
1130931539833950208 2019-05-21 13:21:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> Yesterday, Trump tried to attack me at his campaign rally by saying I abandoned Pennsylvania.  I’ve never forgotten where I came from. My family did have to leave Pennsylvania when I was 10 — we moved to Delaware where my Dad found a job that could provide for our family.
1130866163783806981 2019-05-21 09:01:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> States across the nation are passing extreme laws that violate a woman’s constitutional right to choose. These bills are a blatant attempt to overturn Roe v Wade. It's wrong. It's pernicious. We must #StopTheBans and ensure this choice remains between a woman and her doctor.  https://t.co/J4FL9nQgol
1129900458905100289 2019-05-18 17:03:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to everyone who joined us in Philadelphia, attended watch parties in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, and tuned in across the nation. We're just getting started. I know if we work together, there's nothing we can't do. Sign up to join us:  https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW  https://t.co/EL4OSyW1NI

1129835865478455298 2019-05-18 12:47:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s time we pick our heads up, come together, and remember our best days are still ahead. #TeamJoe  https://t.co/Ke9vCO1aBD
1129820483548057600 2019-05-18 11:46:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> America has stood as a beacon of hope around the world for generations. #TeamJoe  https://t.co/cFPN8D8qDW
1129819469050798080 2019-05-18 11:42:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe helped make government work before, and he’ll make it work again. #TeamJoe  https://t.co/E5vA58zhcL
1129817884191076352 2019-05-18 11:35:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> At the core of our campaign is a simple idea: we are at our best when we’re one America. #TeamJoe  https://t.co/92bQIcV7wp
1129816323264057345 2019-05-18 11:29:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> We choose hope over fear, truth over lies, and unity over division. #TeamJoe  https://t.co/rg0wC4irnC
1129815340756721664 2019-05-18 11:25:42 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s up to every generation to do the work to protect and perfect our democracy. #TeamJoe  https://t.co/X7YlONYEkF
1129814026534510592 2019-05-18 11:20:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe introduced one of the first climate change bills in the Senate and has been at the forefront of the fight ever since. As president, he’ll take aggressive action to protect our planet for future generations. #TeamJoe  https://t.co/8gADghxGuw
1129811790815289346 2019-05-18 11:11:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> From ensuring everyone has quality, affordable health care to action on climate change — everything is on the line in this election. #TeamJoe  https://t.co/hUHBwEpd6y
1129811393480462338 2019-05-18 11:10:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our nation was founded on the principles of equality, equity, and fairness. But from day one, America has failed to live up to that promise for most of its people.   We must do better. We can do better. #TeamJoe  https://t.co/HEyxi8MGyI
1129810677671944192 2019-05-18 11:07:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> Simply put: we are better than this. #TeamJoe  https://t.co/DKObz89vo8
1129810475129212928 2019-05-18 11:06:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> We the People. Those three words changed everything. #TeamJoe  https://t.co/YBZQumFBzK
1129808710245781504 2019-05-18 10:59:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@TeamJoe here! We’re taking over to keep you in the loop on our campaign’s official kickoff in Philadelphia. If you aren’t already, head to  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 to tune in.
1129808141099700225 2019-05-18 10:57:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m about to take the stage, so I’m handing over the account to my staff to make sure you don’t miss a thing. Head to  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 to tune in as we launch our campaign.
1129807915634876417 2019-05-18 10:56:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> The life of my love — the love of my life — the person who put our family back together. I love you, Jilly! @DrBiden
1129806433258749957 2019-05-18 10:50:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> Over 200 years ago, our nation was born out of a bold statement: We the People.  Not You. Not Me. But We.  https://t.co/lpZQhhHCIc
1129806203305881602 2019-05-18 10:49:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> Watch Live: Joe Biden Officially Launches Campaign for President  https://t.co/HECZJ3EXsz
1129801214198210560 2019-05-18 10:29:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m so excited to be in Philadelphia — the birthplace of American democracy — to launch our campaign. I’ll be taking the stage soon, head to  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 to tune in.
1129532101605433345 2019-05-17 16:40:13 -0800 <JoeBiden> No one should be fired, denied a home or access to services because of who they are or who they love. But that’s not the reality for many LGBTQ Americans.  Today’s historic passage of the #EqualityAct moves us one step closer to righting this wrong — the Senate should act now.
1129511411133108226 2019-05-17 15:18:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> At the core of our campaign is the idea that we always do better when we act as one America. If we choose unity over division there’s nothing we can’t do. Tune in tomorrow at 1 PM ET to join us as we kick off our campaign in Philadelphia:  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50  https://t.co/p7YbYtSCYG
1129467118691373056 2019-05-17 12:22:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to the @NVAssemblyDems &amp; @NVSenateDems for their hard work — and the people of Nevada for making this a reality. The Silver State is in good hands with these women leading the way.
1129182201151676419 2019-05-16 17:29:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our campaign is built on restoring the American idea, that all men and women are created equal. That’s why we’re basing our campaign in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania -- the birthplace of this great experiment, American democracy.  https://t.co/G1JPu0E5Jk
1129163367762092033 2019-05-16 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Los EEUU fueron fundados con una simple frase: We the people. Nosotros el Pueblo. Me postulo para Presidente para unificar nuestro país y asegurar que alcancemos el ideal de nuestros fundadores. Únase este sábado en Filadelfia para lanzar nuestra campaña:  https://t.co/a9SS6Ggm4Z  https://t.co/kWlWwQzklI
1129135685665984514 2019-05-16 14:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m running for president to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild its backbone — the middle class, and unify all Americans.  If you’re with me, join us as we launch our campaign in Philadelphia this Saturday:  https://t.co/a9SS6Ggm4Z  https://t.co/Ib7TWqFNUh
1128758197869850624 2019-05-15 13:25:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It was good to be back in New Hampshire! Thank you to everyone who came out to join us in Hampton, Manchester, and Nashua.  https://t.co/EEQeowo1yG
1128736808114765824 2019-05-15 12:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to the hundreds of people who joined us yesterday in the cold and rain in Nashua, NH. Our political system is broken, but I’m more optimistic about America’s chances today than I have ever been. If we come together and remember who we are, there’s nothing we can’t do.  https://t.co/3xwB6lPnDc
1128669112698380294 2019-05-15 07:31:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Republicans in AL, FL, GA, and OH are ushering in laws that clearly violate Roe v Wade and they should be declared unconstitutional. Roe v Wade is settled law and should not be overturned. This choice should remain between a woman and her doctor.
1128438592022425600 2019-05-14 16:15:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect under the law—regardless of who they are or who they love. Now is not the time to back down. We must stand up to this Administration's intolerance and ensure America lives up to our founding ideals.  https://t.co/IY0JvqzxOU
1128384484867371008 2019-05-14 12:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We simply cannot accept that the number of uninsured Americans is growing. We need to defend the Affordable Care Act and build upon the progress we made to ensure every American has access to high quality, affordable health care.  https://t.co/wznMlDr9dj
1128035443918954496 2019-05-13 13:33:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> This Saturday, we’re officially launching our campaign to unite this country in Philadelphia — the city that first brought our nation together over 200 years ago. We’d love to see you there, head to  https://t.co/a9SS6Ggm4Z to RSVP and learn more.  https://t.co/feuLM8WnAN
1127972346416041984 2019-05-13 09:22:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every American should be encouraged to exercise their right to vote. I stand with @JeanneShaheen in opposing the voter suppression law that makes it harder for students in New Hampshire to participate in our political process. This law should be overturned.
1127696954689896448 2019-05-12 15:08:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Join us in Philadelphia on Saturday, May 18th, as we officially launch our campaign! Head to  https://t.co/a9SS6FYKGp to RSVP today.
1127667762682376192 2019-05-12 13:12:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our campaign starts at the local level. Neighbors talking with neighbors, communities coming together—that’s how we’ll change the country. That’s why we’re organizing watch parties all across this nation to launch our campaign. Sign up to host yours today.  https://t.co/AVCOrPu0oJ
1127635298500800512 2019-05-12 11:03:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> New Hampshire, we’re heading to Manchester tomorrow and we’d love to see you there! Head to  https://t.co/AmHGUD929H to RSVP.
1127581192444882945 2019-05-12 07:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> My mom was an incredible woman, and I miss her. She would always tell us that “courage is the greatest virtue, because without courage you cannot love with abandon.” She lived her life that way, loving us with abandon. I want to wish every mother out there a Happy Mother’s Day.  https://t.co/zlpNBjY79g
1127337088418963456 2019-05-11 15:18:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> #TeamJoe is hosting house parties across the country to help kick off our campaign. RSVP at  https://t.co/r0RlGVVUmE to attend a watch party in your community.

1126915077653827585 2019-05-10 11:21:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need policies that reflect this urgency. I'll have more specifics on how America can lead on climate in the coming weeks.
1126915076764647424 2019-05-10 11:21:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m proud to have been one of the first to introduce climate change legislation. What I fought for in 1986 is more important than ever — climate change is an existential threat. Now. Today.
1126609288116547591 2019-05-09 15:06:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our movement’s strength is rooted in communities all across this country. That’s why we’re bringing together #TeamJoe to officially kick off our campaign. Sign up to help by hosting a watch party in your community at  https://t.co/UifVy6wxCb.  https://t.co/sAFac86Nex
1126554426553008129 2019-05-09 11:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s time we restore the great American middle class that built this country. That starts with making a $15 minimum wage the law of the land, ensuring health care is a right not a privilege, and creating a tax code that rewards work, not just wealth.  https://t.co/6w9DZZoGSJ
1126510889769865216 2019-05-09 08:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thanks to my friend, Mayor @EricGarcetti for the tacos yesterday in Los Angeles. I’ll be back soon and the ice cream is on me.
1126243628148350976 2019-05-08 14:53:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m proud to stand with Uber and Lyft drivers across the country today. Every worker in this country deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
1126225257961021440 2019-05-08 13:40:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re officially kicking off our campaign with a rally in Philadelphia on Saturday, May 18th! RSVP to join us by heading to  https://t.co/a9SS6Ggm4Z.
1126191971754807301 2019-05-08 11:27:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must remember Kendrick's name and sacrifice. We must ensure his legacy lives in our shared commitment to stopping these tragedies. Children shouldn’t fear going to school and parents shouldn't need to rely on the uncommon courage of an 18-year-old hero to keep their kids safe.
1126191970865614849 2019-05-08 11:27:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> Kendrick Castillo will not collect his high school diploma this week because he gave his life trying to protect his classmates from another senseless act of violence in an American school yesterday. My heart goes out to his family and all those affected by yesterday's shooting.
1125927566974619648 2019-05-07 17:57:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> One year ago, this Administration began ripping apart immigrant families. Putting children in cages. As I told @Astrid_NV and other brave activists today, we can fix our broken immigration system without tossing aside our values.  https://t.co/zYCz1PViOX
1125826631245926408 2019-05-07 11:16:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m so inspired by @DrBiden for her dedication to educating future generations. Happy #TeacherAppreciationDay to all the hardworking educators out there!
1125819080919769094 2019-05-07 10:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, we’re getting ready for our event this afternoon in Nevada and we’d love to see you there! RSVP at:  https://t.co/DmLgUJfzsE
1125544863305433091 2019-05-06 16:36:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> @samanthapetrick Hey Rocco, happy 9th birthday! Sorry I missed the party. I hope you got some ice cream with that #Biden2020 cookie.
1125529422205816834 2019-05-06 15:35:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, on the birth of their baby boy! The truth is there’s no better job than being a parent. Jill and I wish you the best of luck on your next chapter.
1125515077564502016 2019-05-06 14:38:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> On Saturday, Jill and I visited Columbia, South Carolina, to discuss how we’ll build an inclusive middle class where everyone — regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion or disability — comes along. Thank you to everyone who joined us, we’ll be back soon!  https://t.co/jly3piXzPE
1125497461785616386 2019-05-06 13:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Nevada, we’re taking our campaign to Henderson tomorrow, May 7th! Head to  https://t.co/zTS0WldilG to RSVP and come join us.
1125196320816467969 2019-05-05 17:31:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> On this first day of Ramadan, Jill and I wish peace and happiness to Muslims around the world celebrating the holy month. Ramadan Kareem.
1125177603780825089 2019-05-05 16:17:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our country may seem more divided than ever, but I know our best days are still ahead. It’s time we lift our heads up and remember who we are. If you’re ready to get to work, join our campaign today.  https://t.co/lyhRyWPhvS
1125113934619406337 2019-05-05 12:04:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re in the battle for the soul of this nation, but I’ve never been more optimistic about our future. If we work together, I know we can get this country back on track. Join our campaign:  https://t.co/lyhRyWPhvS
1125094498927878144 2019-05-05 10:46:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> America is an idea that has grown stronger through the unique contributions of Latinos. @latinovictoryus works tirelessly to empower the community — congrats on 5 years.
1125081222420533249 2019-05-05 09:54:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re kicking off this campaign on May 18th—and we need #TeamJoe’s help. Sign up to host a house party to tune in with your friends and family:  https://t.co/3TRBR6Fz8i  https://t.co/csz3BwPlns
1124814461536223234 2019-05-04 16:14:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you for the warm welcome, Columbia! It’s always great to be back in South Carolina.  https://t.co/P2YMTy236V
1124792315623747585 2019-05-04 14:46:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve seen the selfless heroism of firefighters firsthand — they run toward danger and risk their lives every single day for strangers. On International Firefighters' Day, I extend my deepest gratitude to all the men and women who keep our communities safe.
1124746765494710272 2019-05-04 11:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tough, resilient, and always full of hope — that’s the America I know and that’s the America we must restore. It’s time to dig deep, take action, and fight for the soul of this nation. Join our campaign and let’s get to work.  https://t.co/lyhRyWPhvS
1124411305333592064 2019-05-03 13:32:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Since we launched our campaign last week, we’ve seen Americans in every corner of the country step up and say they’re in. Will you join us? Head to  https://t.co/twQHMjvY7e and be part of our team.
1124313410487955456 2019-05-03 07:03:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Last year, Floridians voted to restore voting rights to those who served their time for felonies. But today, Florida's Senate votes on a bill that would instead create a modern-day poll tax, suppressing the vote of tens of thousands of Americans. This is unacceptable.
1124102681163960321 2019-05-02 17:05:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> On Holocaust Remembrance Day, let us pause and reflect on the millions of Jews who lost their lives at the hands of the Nazi regime.  The events of the last few months remind us that it’s not enough to just say never again—we must speak up and act against hate.
1123995821962420225 2019-05-02 10:01:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs and Hedge Fund Managers. It was built by you — the great American middle class. I’m thankful for all the support this week from union membership and their families, including the IAFF.  https://t.co/0utHvHuUyi
1123973670982971392 2019-05-02 08:33:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, the House votes on #HR9, the #ClimateActionNow Act, which restores our commitment to the #ParisAgreement. We need to face facts on climate change. It’s already here. It is a major threat to our future and we simply cannot wait to take action.
1123729112374435841 2019-05-01 16:21:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> Happy 48th Birthday to @Amtrak and the incredible men and women whose tireless work every day keeps the trains running and our country moving.  https://t.co/vz9pxE84Ja
1123646451593170946 2019-05-01 10:52:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m the proud husband of a teacher and know first-hand the impact of their work. Teachers around the country and in South Carolina deserve to earn a living wage and have smaller class sizes so that America can continue to out-educate and lead the world. #AllOutMay1
1123352740363681792 2019-04-30 15:25:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> The violence in Venezuela today against peaceful protesters is criminal. Maduro's regime is responsible for incredible suffering. The U.S. must stand with the National Assembly &amp; Guaidó in their efforts to restore democracy through legitimate, internationally monitored elections.
1123351320008650752 2019-04-30 15:20:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's no secret that I love ice cream. I enjoyed stopping by The Cone Shoppe in Monticello for some chocolate/vanilla twist soft serve and the chance to talk with some Iowans after our first campaign stop.  https://t.co/jVFLBUwFp6
1123345065169047554 2019-04-30 14:55:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> It was great to see many of our first responders and union leaders in Cedar Rapids today. This country was built by hard working Americans like you, and I look forward to being back soon!  https://t.co/qhtqdfweht
1123248557132271616 2019-04-30 08:31:39 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, The House will hold it's first hearing on the Equal Rights Amendment in 36 years. It's way past time to give all people protection under the Constitution--human rights should never be caught up in the whims of whichever political party is in power. We need the #ERANow.
1123165096832831488 2019-04-30 03:00:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Serving as @BarackObama's Vice President was a privilege and an honor. We share the belief that America is a place where ordinary people do extraordinary things and anything is possible.  https://t.co/Y5rXEijgIu
1122977748497178624 2019-04-29 14:35:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, we’re just getting started! I’ll be heading to Iowa next. Visit  https://t.co/7Je6uld7qQ for event details and to RSVP. Hope to see you soon!
1122977747779903497 2019-04-29 14:35:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> We must turbocharge our efforts to address climate change that threatens communities across the country. Through clean, renewable energy and cleaner, safer, faster transportation, America will not only help the environment but provide millions of good-paying middle-class jobs.
1122977747045953542 2019-04-29 14:35:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> Whether you’re covered through your employer, on your own, or not at all - you should have a choice to buy into a public option health plan like Medicare.
1122977746391638016 2019-04-29 14:35:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Affordable Care Act was a huge step forward for this country. Now we have to finish the job and make health care a right, not a privilege, and give everyone the peace of mind they deserve.
1122977745699577857 2019-04-29 14:35:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> By making post-secondary education and training affordable to and making sure the economy works not only for folks with a four-year degree but also for those who complete on-the-job training and trade programs, too.
1122977745049477126 2019-04-29 14:35:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> Twelve years of education is not enough. In order to rebuild a strong middle class, we must provide skills needed to do the jobs of the 21st Century.
1122977744218939392 2019-04-29 14:35:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need to get rid of the capital gains loophole for multimillionaires. I’m going to change it so millionaires and billionaires don’t pay lower tax rates than teachers and firefighters. We need to reward work in this country, not just wealth.
1122977743321300993 2019-04-29 14:35:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> Companies continue to squeeze every last penny out of workers, making it harder and harder for Americans to make ends meet. It’s way past time we make a $15 minimum wage the law of the land.
1122977742549659649 2019-04-29 14:35:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs and hedge fund managers. It was built by you. The great American middle class. That’s the story of America and together we can rebuild the backbone of this nation.
1122977741710688257 2019-04-29 14:35:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> As I shared in Pittsburgh today, there are three reasons I’m running for President - to restore the soul of our nation, rebuild its backbone - the middle class, and unify all Americans. If you stand with me, join our campaign:  https://t.co/twQHMjvY7e
1122896956676812800 2019-04-29 09:14:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm sick of this President badmouthing unions. Labor built the middle class in this country. Minimum wage, overtime pay, the 40-hour week: they exist for all of us because unions fought for those rights. We need a President who honors them and their work.
1122877945280962566 2019-04-29 07:58:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> I couldn't be more proud to have the International Association of Fire Fighters on my team. Unions built the middle class in this country—and as President, I'll fight to strengthen them and grow the backbone of this country.
1122651175688515584 2019-04-28 16:57:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> I've said it before and I'll say it again. To speak to the middle class, we need to reject the super PAC system. That's exactly what this campaign is doing.  https://t.co/Jc46rdBbsh
1122637114259075072 2019-04-28 16:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Join me in Pittsburgh tomorrow for a discussion on my plan to build a middle class where everyone comes along. RSVP to let me know you’ll be there:  https://t.co/WLKs9xmHM7
1122615020456677376 2019-04-28 14:34:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> Iowa, I'm headed to town this week! Let me know you'll join us by RSVPing at  https://t.co/NdJwunC2kP  https://t.co/8i6GPQKV6x
1122563948367306759 2019-04-28 11:11:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> Dick Lugar was among the most decent men I have ever known. Kind, loyal, dedicated beyond measure to the service of the American people. Dick Lugar was my dear friend.   Jill and I send our condolences to his wife Charlene and the entire Lugar family.
1122516318429646849 2019-04-28 08:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Wishing everyone in the Orthodox Christian community a peaceful and joyful Easter celebration with friends, family and loved ones. God Bless.
1122294254645207043 2019-04-27 17:19:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I are devastated to hear about today’s shooting at the Chabad Poway synagogue. No one should have to worship in fear.  As a country, we must speak out against bigotry and gun violence. We’re in the battle for the soul of this nation—and it’s on all of us to act.
1122153428627656705 2019-04-27 08:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I have a message for #TeamJoe: Thank you!  https://t.co/j61zCaZmDz
1121915023444590601 2019-04-26 16:12:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> I had the privilege to thank one of our grassroots donors. It's because of supporters like Josh we're able to make this campaign a reality and bring this country together.  https://t.co/afNTBQb4xB
1121857770632962048 2019-04-26 12:25:10 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to the women of @TheView for the conversation today. It’s always a pleasure to sit down with you at the table. #TheView   Credit: ABC/Lorenzo Bevilaqua  https://t.co/lRNMXwslDw
1121781611119431681 2019-04-26 07:22:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> Looking forward to joining the women of @TheView today for my first live interview since announcing my 2020 campaign for President. Tune in 11e|10c|p on @ABCNetwork. #TheView
1121544466580549633 2019-04-25 15:40:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> UPDATE: We’re about to close the books on an AMAZING first day of our campaign. It’s not too late to be a part of it. Chip in before midnight to be a Day One donor.  https://t.co/yniXNJl7ia #Joe2020  https://t.co/MmDdyUsHZh
1121515473915478025 2019-04-25 13:45:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our campaign is off to a great start thanks to thousands of Americans who have made donations. If you haven’t had the chance just yet, I hope you will join us too! Head to  https://t.co/yniXNJl7ia to make a donation today. #Joe2020
1121458852875075586 2019-04-25 10:00:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Folks, earlier today I announced that I’m running for President of the United States. The strength of this movement depends on you. Head over to  https://t.co/yniXNJl7ia to make a donation today. #Joe2020
1121426527491690496 2019-04-25 07:51:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our country is being put to the test, but I’ve never been more optimistic about America. Together we can do this. Make a Day One donation to join us.  https://t.co/xfD5pLtmAf #Joe2020  https://t.co/UbLPMfE8Ui
1121363091651010560 2019-04-25 03:39:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hoy estoy anunciando mi candidatura para presidente de los Estados Unidos. Somos los Estados Unidos de America - y juntos no hay nada que no podamos hacer. Únete a nuestra campaña:  https://t.co/9MBT8Qkyzd #Joe2020  https://t.co/GhSYDci4dr
1121353260231688192 2019-04-25 03:00:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> The core values of this nation… our standing in the world… our very democracy...everything that has made America -- America --is at stake. That’s why today I’m announcing my candidacy for President of the United States. #Joe2020  https://t.co/jzaQbyTEz3
1119035047619833862 2019-04-18 17:28:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> The hard working men and women of @UFCW that I met today are going without pay during this strike. If you can, pitch in to make sure that those workers facing the greatest hardship are supported.  https://t.co/49JkqJG1Cu
1118986242501283849 2019-04-18 14:14:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> My wife Jill always reminds me that any country that out-educates us will out-compete us. Our teachers must have the resources they need &amp; the wages they deserve so that America will continue to lead the world. Great speech today on this from @rweingarten.  https://t.co/aaU10GNjOB
1118961082838724608 2019-04-18 12:34:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm on my way up to a rally at #StopandShop in Boston to stand with some of the 31,000 @UFCW union members who are currently fighting against cuts to wages and health care for themselves and their families. Stand with us:  https://t.co/D4baO7D5xH
1117900747130036224 2019-04-15 14:21:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> For centuries, Notre Dame Cathedral has withstood wars, revolutions, and the test of time. It is a symbol of faith &amp; a testament to history. And even as our hearts break to see it burn today during the holiest week of the year for Catholics, I have faith that it will rise again.
1117150655024717825 2019-04-13 12:40:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> This is powerful. I would encourage everyone to read and take to heart Kyle’s message on privilege.  https://t.co/Kceif5wFvg
1116811587111792640 2019-04-12 14:13:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the last 5 years, @StopandShop's parent company has bought back billions of dollars in stock. Now they want to cut employee wages &amp; benefits. This is wrong. I stand with the 31,000 @UFCW workers fighting for their healthcare. Join me and support them:  https://t.co/D4baO7D5xH
1114555617245634566 2019-04-06 08:49:01 -0800 <JoeBiden>  https://t.co/WiA0Ux3aYE
1113923632512761857 2019-04-04 14:57:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> I see that you are on the job and presidential, as always.
1113515882960052224 2019-04-03 11:57:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> Social norms are changing. I understand that, and I’ve heard what these women are saying. Politics to me has always been about making connections, but I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future. That’s my responsibility and I will meet it.  https://t.co/Ya2mf5ODts
1111652061001584642 2019-03-29 08:31:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> Stoning people to death for homosexuality or adultery is appalling and immoral. Every single person on earth is entitled to be treated with dignity and to live without fear. There is no excuse—not culture, not tradition—for this kind of hate and inhumanity.
1111383490832945152 2019-03-28 14:44:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@NRA opposition to a full reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act is sickening. We must do more to protect victims of stalking and abuse. It makes no sense to allow those who perpetrated the abuse to have access to deadly firearms. We must stand up now for survivors.
1111332228129325057 2019-03-28 11:20:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> Whether on the assembly line, at the grocery store checkout, or in the boardroom, every woman deserves to make every penny a man doing the same job makes. The #PaycheckFairnessAct will help us get there. Congratulations @rosadelauro and thank you for your leadership on this.
1110689289229266944 2019-03-26 16:45:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> I was honored to meet Vlad and Adrianna tonight at the #BidenCourageAwards. These young people exemplify what @ItsOnUs is all about. I hope their bravery inspires more to take action to change our culture.  Join these leaders and sign the #ItsOnUs pledge:  https://t.co/7yB47THGYQ
1109879662816067584 2019-03-24 11:08:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m proud of my alma mater @UDelaware &amp; the student organizers of @UDance for their commitment to fighting childhood cancer.   Today, they are hosting a 12 hour dance marathon benefiting the @BePositiveFdn. Join me in supporting this worthy cause.  https://t.co/d69oDCAgzL
1107003115746807808 2019-03-16 12:38:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> The people of Guatemala should be the ones to choose their next president. The stakes are high: promoting transparency, shared prosperity, and combating corruption. For this reason, the @TSEGuatemala needs to certify all eligible presidential candidates by the Sunday deadline.
1106585802035867649 2019-03-15 08:59:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> Silence is complicity. Our children are listening. The time to speak out is now.
1106585800572055553 2019-03-15 08:59:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> Whether it is antisemitism in Pittsburgh, racism in Charlottesville, or the xenophobia and Islamophobia today in Christchurch, violent hate is on the march at home and abroad. We cannot stand by as mosques are turned into murder scenes.
1106585799494197250 2019-03-15 08:59:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> On behalf of Jill, myself, and all of the Bidens, our hearts go out to the community in Christchurch suffering from today’s senseless violence. Friday prayers for those who were gathered at their mosques has seen families torn apart by hate.
1106010792367931393 2019-03-13 18:54:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> No one should live in fear of being fired, evicted from their home, or denied service in a restaurant just because of their gender identity or who they love. The #EqualityAct is long overdue, and will ensure LGBTQ Americans are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.
1105270122955096064 2019-03-11 17:51:46 -0800 <JoeBiden>  https://t.co/SOZ9EUh854
1105270121336053761 2019-03-11 17:51:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe Boardman led @Amtrak through difficult times, taking over during the worst economic crisis since the Depression, and starting a modernization that will help deliver the 21st century rail system America deserves. My thoughts are with his wife Joanne and their family.
1104176453560819715 2019-03-08 16:25:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> Each year on International Women’s Day, we reaffirm the straightforward truth that achieving the goal of full and equal rights for women is essential to the success of all our nations.  More on #IWD2019 here:  https://t.co/TVl24g71Bi
1101265221476331521 2019-02-28 15:37:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> @CynthiaNixon You’re right, Cynthia. I was making a point in a foreign policy context, that under normal circumstances a Vice President wouldn’t be given a silent reaction on the world stage.   But there is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights, and that includes the Vice President.
1100456020688756736 2019-02-26 10:02:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> Notes are ready. Be sure to tune in at 3pm ET when I will sit down at @UDBidenSchool with author and historian @jmeacham to talk about his book “The Soul of America” and the state of our democracy today.  https://t.co/3F6qAEE3qA  https://t.co/irisDJmDLu
1099072824055136256 2019-02-22 14:25:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> Foreign election interference is not only a serious threat to our democratic institutions, it’s a threat to our national security. Russia and other authoritarian regimes are actively seeking to try to change outcomes of our democratic elections, and we can’t allow that to happen.
1096495300355645440 2019-02-15 11:43:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today I congratulated President @IvanDuque on his successful visit to Washington. Maintaining strong bipartisan support for #Colombia is vitally important to meeting key security and economic challenges in the hemisphere, including humanitarian aid for refugees from #Venezuela.
1096434425733226496 2019-02-15 07:41:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> Stand with survivors and advocates like @nguyen_amanda, @ZerlinaMaxwell, @ruthmglenn, @DavidsonJess22, @Mariska, and so many others. Reauthorize VAWA now.
1096434423040479232 2019-02-15 07:41:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> There is nothing more powerful that Congress can do to help women, strengthen families, and save lives than reauthorizing VAWA. Now.
1096434421899640832 2019-02-15 07:41:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> VAWA’s power is that it gets stronger with each reauthorization. This year can be no different. Like was done in 2000 and 2005 and 2013, we must expand the reach of VAWA to respond to the needs of survivors at risk every day.
1096434420557537280 2019-02-15 07:41:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> One in five women will still be victims of rape or attempted rape in their lifetimes. On average, three women a day are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends. Nothing is more urgent than reauthorizing and expanding the law that makes women safer.
1096434419378933760 2019-02-15 07:41:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> Since the passage of VAWA, annual rates of domestic violence have dropped by 63%. The National Domestic Violence Hotline responds to more than 26,000 people a month, creating a safety net for survivors. We have made progress, but there is much more to do. Right now.
1096434417948680192 2019-02-15 07:41:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> When I wrote the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, I believed it would be a lifeline. But this Congress has turned it into a political football. It’s time to pass a strong reauthorization to the Violence Against Women Act. No more stalling. Lives are on the line.
1096111514585567232 2019-02-14 10:18:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know from personal experience the only way to overcome grief is to find purpose. The Parkland students &amp; families will not allow us to turn away from our responsibilities to those 17 fallen angels. We aren’t there yet, but with their determination &amp; insistence, we’ll get there.
1096111512870113281 2019-02-14 10:18:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> One year after the tragic massacre in Parkland, we’ve not done nearly enough to ensure this will never happen again. In the last year far too many have died from gun violence. But I have hope. #MSDStrong
1094345590069174273 2019-02-09 13:21:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> Only a tyrant would prevent the delivery of food and medicine to people he claims to lead. The international community must support Juan Guaido and the National Assembly. It is time for Maduro to step aside and allow a democratic transition. The Venezuelan people deserve better.
1093707822255296512 2019-02-07 19:07:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> John Dingell was the Dean of the House. He earned that title — not just because he was there the longest — but because he led with great moral courage and vision. He was a friend and I will miss him terribly. Debbie is in my prayers.
1092999736624406528 2019-02-05 20:13:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> Stacey Abrams achieved in a matter of minutes something Donald Trump failed to do in over an hour -- to embrace and give voice to the spirit and core values that make America great.
1092871910067707906 2019-02-05 11:45:42 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today far too many transgender youth continue to face rejection at home and discrimination in their communities. Check out the work @bidenfoundation is doing with @lgbtmap and @genderspectrum to support these young people:  https://t.co/TxMLXge8vh  #AdvancingAcceptance
1091712355849945088 2019-02-02 06:58:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> There is no place for racism in America. Governor Northam has lost all moral authority and should resign immediately, Justin Fairfax is the leader Virginia needs now.
1091129128512827393 2019-01-31 16:20:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> Through the #HandsOffIX website, @endrapeoncampus,@knowyourIX have helped thousands make their voices heard in the notice and comment process.  https://t.co/EBBlWMQ5ex
1091129125602058240 2019-01-31 16:20:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Fellow @UDelaware Blue Hen @Sage_Gaea of @knowyourIX has done so much for the students of Delaware through her advocacy, and is now fighting for students across the country.
1091129122158493696 2019-01-31 16:20:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> .@DavidsonJess22 of @endrapeoncampus has been advocating for safer campuses since long before I met her in the White House. Jess, I’m so grateful for your tireless work, and proud of all that you continue to accomplish.  https://t.co/FxESpdGMx6
1091129106694066176 2019-01-31 16:20:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> Students and survivors are making their voices heard. Grassroots organizers are working to make sure these guidelines are never put into effect.
1091129105041551361 2019-01-31 16:20:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> This week @bidenfoundation submitted a comment to the Department of Education about proposed changes to #TitleIX guidance.  These new rules would endanger students and make it harder for survivors of sexual assault to seek justice.
1090422326783606784 2019-01-29 17:31:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie.
1089240523884425216 2019-01-26 11:15:52 -0800 <JoeBiden>  https://t.co/iYah5x11To
1089240522319978496 2019-01-26 11:15:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> An untested rape kit means a survivor without justice. I wrote the first rape kit backlog law because every survivor deserves closure, and because evidence shows testing kits can identify men who have committed multiple rapes - and might again. Test every kit. Every single one.
1087413570168651776 2019-01-21 10:16:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> The spirit of Dr. King is still with us. It has burrowed deep into the soul of this nation. It will not let us rest. On #MLKDay we must heed Dr. King’s admonition from his final sermon and do our part to “make America what it ought to be.”
1085735289128128512 2019-01-16 19:07:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congratulations to the two women who led the way: @RepLonghurst and @HansenForSenate, as well as all of the lawmakers, activists, and citizens who made this happen.
1085735287391584256 2019-01-16 19:07:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex.”   Another step forward for equality and basic dignity in Delaware tonight, as the Equal Rights Amendment is enshrined in our state’s Constitution.
1083925881402392576 2019-01-11 19:17:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> White supremacists and their shameful ideology should have no place in this country in 2019, let alone a voice of sympathy in the United States Congress.
1076114643947585537 2018-12-21 05:58:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> I know I’m a little biased, but this post from Jill @DrBiden in the #BidenForum is a must-read. Her story of the strong middle-class values that shaped her is America’s story. And she tells it so well.  https://t.co/RbsmCOGRv5
1075937213056249856 2018-12-20 18:13:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> It is clear this administration has abandoned those core American beliefs. Secretary Mattis’ presence and his voice of reason and experience will be missed in the Pentagon and the Situation Room.
1075937211919544320 2018-12-20 18:13:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’ve had disagreements with Secretary Mattis, but we shared the view — long-held by Democrats and Republicans in this nation — that respect for our allies and a commitment to the most important and effective alliances in history made America safer.
1073716529336860673 2018-12-14 15:09:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> Friends don't let friends go uninsured. If you still need health insurance for 2019, tomorrow, December 15th, is the last day to get it through  https://t.co/2Ls3d80By6. This is about your health and peace of mind for you and your loved ones — there's nothing more important.  https://t.co/hnXCRbOiOZ
1071042085464223745 2018-12-07 06:01:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> This summer, the @bidenfoundation asked you to share stories about the importance of family and community acceptance for #LGBTQ young people. Here’s what you’ve said so far:  https://t.co/o3NTnmNzH1
1068988709486309376 2018-12-01 14:02:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> Now that’s more like it.
1068983689613205505 2018-12-01 13:42:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> President George H.W. Bush was a decent, kind, and gracious statesman. This nation will miss him. Our condolences go out to the entire Bush family for their loss.  https://t.co/vF2qRPm4by
1065643326676844544 2018-11-22 08:29:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> Grateful for the time spent with loved ones this Thanksgiving, and grateful for the sacrifice of those military families whose loved ones are on duty, unable to be with their families. From our family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving.
1063541867910963201 2018-11-16 13:18:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> Betsy DeVos’ new Title IX rules will discourage sexual assault reporting and investigations. When 1 in 5 women experience sexual assault while in college, we can’t afford to go backwards. Share your views:  https://t.co/eSsO7c9yXD
1063190264318173187 2018-11-15 14:01:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> The fires continue to burn in California, and our firefighters are among those who are losing everything. Right now, no matter where you live, you can help. Please give to support firefighters who have lost their homes to the wildfires:  https://t.co/BwM7gzZAjw
1062845234663563266 2018-11-14 15:10:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> Instead of saying every legal vote should be counted in Florida, Republicans have adopted a strategy to discredit the process.   It’s wrong – and it’s dangerous.   Count every single lawful vote. Count them fairly. Count them transparently.  https://t.co/9pANgOv2dY
1062195924527734784 2018-11-12 20:10:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congratulations to @kyrstensinema for a well-earned victory tonight. She’s going to do incredible work for Arizona. Credit to @MarthaMcSally as well for handling the results with true dignity and class.
1061698756209336320 2018-11-11 11:14:43 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every military family knows what it means to sacrifice. Every individual life and story matters. It is who we are as Americans.   On #VeteransDay and every day we must stand up for the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us.
1060999395653640192 2018-11-09 12:55:42 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s the most fundamental American right: the right to vote — and for your vote to be counted. Count all the votes in Florida, Georgia, and Arizona. Count them fairly. Count them transparently.
1059927453890723840 2018-11-06 13:56:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> There's still time to take this election into your own hands. Don't regret what you could have done—take action right now:  https://t.co/hPaGx4kLyA
1059862886414192641 2018-11-06 09:39:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> No better time to help get out the vote than right now—whether you have a lunch break or a few hours to spare, take back our democracy at an event near you:  https://t.co/hPaGx4kLyA
1059781974041202688 2018-11-06 04:18:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> So let's do this. Get out there and vote today. Here's an easy place to confirm where you can vote, check voting hours, and find out if you need to bring anything with you. It's time.  https://t.co/8XWNjhOkYl
1059781339908632576 2018-11-06 04:15:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today is #ElectionDay, and this election is bigger than politics. Today we have a chance to reclaim our American ideals and take this country back.  https://t.co/OlrEFfM9D7
1059226802613350401 2018-11-04 15:32:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> The work we began that night ten years ago in Grant Park is unfinished.   If you still believe, as I do, that hope is more powerful than fear, then show up and vote. And bring five people with you.  https://t.co/SOLx6WfZjL
1058854002102808576 2018-11-03 15:50:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> You don’t need to be a Vice President or a podcast star to to make a difference in this election.   Volunteer now, knock on some doors, and make sure you show up to vote this Tuesday.
1058734197655912448 2018-11-03 07:54:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> Voting restrictions in Georgia weren’t meant to protect the sanctity of our vote, but to suppress turnout. I applaud the court rulings to overturn them and right these wrongs.   We should be making voting easier, not harder. Now let’s prove nothing can stop us. Vote.
1058732253629493250 2018-11-03 07:46:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> The character of our country is on the ballot on Tuesday, but you still have a chance to make a difference today. Don't just vote -- volunteer on #TheLastWeekend. It's that important.  https://t.co/nw9I8WfFK1  https://t.co/0mvuVFh9aX
1058713718350057472 2018-11-03 06:33:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> I couldn’t be more excited to close out this election in Luzerne County PA on Sunday at a Get Out the Vote rally with my friends @Bob_Casey and @CartwrightPA. Join us:  https://t.co/hwTVp2rwU3
1057632484018405376 2018-10-31 06:56:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> This Thursday evening I’ll be in Lansing, Michigan to support @ElissaSlotkin, Debbie @Stabenow, @GretchenWhitmer and @Garlin. RSVP to join us:  https://t.co/Scf8QXozYU
1057425005745766402 2018-10-30 17:12:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> We can’t leave a single vote on the table, and we’ve got to do everything in our power to re-elect fantastic public servants like Senator @clairecmc.  So I'm heading to Missouri for a Get Out The Vote Rally tomorrow evening. Join us:  https://t.co/Xq30zEESrx
1057421211653804034 2018-10-30 16:57:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'm proud to support @Kelly4SouthrnIL. Brendan is tough, independent, and honest—the kind of leader and public servant that Southern Illinois needs. I'm excited to head to his district for a get out the vote really tomorrow—get info and RSVP here:  https://t.co/LXR6bP5mRn
1057047307634511872 2018-10-29 16:11:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> I'll be in Cedar Rapids tomorrow with @Abby4Iowa and @FredHubbell to rally Iowans around reclaiming our democracy. Let us know you'll be there:  https://t.co/wFg0smel1G
1056588596528988161 2018-10-28 09:48:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ohio needs a champion—a Governor with a back bone—and that’s @RichCordray. He’s ready to fight for working families, and I’m ready to help him get elected.   Join us in Youngstown tomorrow:  https://t.co/AuIH5ny9I1
1055601527518322688 2018-10-25 16:26:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> We desperately need men and women of character in elected office. That's why next Tuesday, one week out from Election Day, I'm proud to join @tammybaldwin &amp; @Tony4WI at early vote rallies. RSVP here:   Madison:  https://t.co/QSDArVzVQ1   Milwaukee  https://t.co/d7AjlNl55I
1055235176983379968 2018-10-24 16:10:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> Together, we can take this country back. That's why I'm heading to Hartford on Friday in support of @NedLamont and @JahanaHayesCT. Don't miss this:    https://t.co/gyLOEZ6eSf
1055203894018695174 2018-10-24 14:06:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> What an honor to be joined by @Alyssa_Milano on tonight’s #ItsOnUs student organizing call. Alyssa, your courage reignited a movement, and your continued advocacy inspires me every day. Thank you.
1055168580394909696 2018-10-24 11:46:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> This country has to come together. This division, this hatred, this ugliness has to end.
1053069875130916864 2018-10-18 16:46:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> Cancer patients own their data, not hospitals. #CountMeIn empowers patients to contribute their data for research. To find cures.  We are changing the culture of cancer research — sharing data, breaking down silos, and forming new collaborations.  We can do this.
1053007546661908480 2018-10-18 12:38:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our basic American values are under assault. But we can take this country back if we show up and vote.   That's why I'm heading to Las Vegas on Saturday at 7:30am for the first day of early voting.   RSVP here to say you’ll be there:  https://t.co/VKKCTWpzve #RiseNVote
1050936548248748033 2018-10-12 19:29:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> 20 years have passed since the murder of young Matthew Shepard. We've come a long way, thanks to organizations like @MattShepardFDN, but our work isn’t done. We cannot stop fighting until every LGBTQ young person is affirmed, supported, and safe. #MSF20
1049686204080447488 2018-10-09 08:41:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joe Tydings and I were both inspired by JFK &amp; RFK and their call to service. In the Senate, he lived up to their example with an ironclad commitment to fight the abuse of power and work to ensure that every American gets a fair shot. Joe made America better—he will be missed.
1047211899811766274 2018-10-02 12:49:07 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jason - public service takes many forms, and bravely stepping forward today is exactly that. By sharing your story, you are saving lives. Others will get the help they need because of you.   Jill and I, and all of the Bidens, are with you, Diana, and True every step of the way.
1046760862114033669 2018-10-01 06:56:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> Dr. James Allison and Dr. Tasuku Honjo’s immunotherapy discovery uses our own body’s defenses to destroy cancer. Today’s @NobelPrize award is a significant leap toward ending cancer as we know it and paving the path to a cure. Congratulations and thank you.
1044764129284755456 2018-09-25 18:42:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> Stopped by @UDelaware and @Penn today for #NationalVoterRegistrationDay. You have the power to change the course of this country, but you have to get engaged. Register now. And show up to vote this fall.  https://t.co/o3EADaBpyN
1043908814959988737 2018-09-23 10:03:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> Macedonia will soon hold a referendum on whether to endorse a historic accord with Greece that will pave the way for NATO membership. Despite Moscow's unrelenting propaganda campaign, Macedonians alone must decide what future they want for their country.  https://t.co/t8DI6sESnv
1043112056378019840 2018-09-21 05:17:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today we are hosting the #BidenCancerSummit in Washington DC and in over 450 communities around the world to bring together patients and providers to commit to making real, practical changes in the lives of cancer patients and their families.   Join us:  https://t.co/QIiNe7T7SE
1039579121448308741 2018-09-11 11:19:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the wake of darker moments in our history, our spirit has become mightier. The bonds that unite us have become thicker.   Seventeen years after the 9/11 attacks, may we continue to live that legacy in our words and our deeds, every day. In America, we can overcome anything.
1039214657636990976 2018-09-10 11:10:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> Before we vote this fall in the most consequential election of any of our lifetimes, I want us to have a real discussion about what really matters: the fundamental issues that determine whether or not all of us are given a chance to live with dignity and to pursue opportunity.
1038124550058397702 2018-09-07 10:59:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> Inspiring words from @BarackObama today.  A powerful reminder that it's on all of us to vote this fall if we want leaders who reflect the civility, character, dignity, and goodness of the American people. The stakes couldn't be higher, but Americans always rise to the occasion.
1037728120760160256 2018-09-06 08:43:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> If there was ever a time for a change of pace, it is now. I recommend giving Michael’s new podcast a listen.
1037726231825866753 2018-09-06 08:36:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> Organized labor is why we have a minimum wage in this country. It’s why we have the five-day work week. It’s why we have worker safety standards. It’s why we have a middle class in America. We owe them.  https://t.co/s8vdvVs4dp
1035700281273733120 2018-08-31 18:26:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales’s decision to end CICIG’s mandate represents a serious blow to anti-corruption efforts in the hemisphere.   The US Administration should condition assistance on CICIG’s continued operation.
1034808303510016000 2018-08-29 07:21:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> I will be in Phoenix tomorrow to pay tribute to my friend John. If you are in town and would like to honor his legacy of service, please come out to the route to say one last farewell.
1033519001719263232 2018-08-25 17:58:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> John McCain was many things – a proud graduate of the Naval Academy, a Senate colleague, a political opponent.   But, to me, more than anything, John was a friend. He will be missed dearly.  https://t.co/AS8YsMLw3d
1033373484079108101 2018-08-25 08:20:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> Leonard and Dody Boswell lived their lives in service to the people of Iowa, and for the last 63 of those years, in loving dedication to each other. We remember both of them today as they are laid to rest.  https://t.co/LWJmFZxvWE
1031562957946273795 2018-08-20 08:25:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re in the midst of an all-out assault on human dignity—yes, at the border, but also in the courtroom, in the classroom, and on the factory floor.
1030868071865561089 2018-08-18 10:24:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> Kofi Annan knew that human beings acting together could make the world better. He dedicated his life to that belief. He insisted that defending human rights and dignity were part of our responsibilities to one another. We are all better for his influence on our world.
1030546249332744192 2018-08-17 13:05:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> The team @LombardiCancer has just made a valuable database of brain cancer biomedical data freely available to researchers globally. We need efforts like this to advance progress against cancer.  https://t.co/mdkF3nBIYi
1030175456367136770 2018-08-16 12:32:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> Aretha Franklin was so much more than a great entertainer. She inspired. She gave hope. She was part of the soul of the civil rights movement. We won't see her like again.
1029836676208705539 2018-08-15 14:06:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> In the time I have known him, John Brennan has never been afraid to speak up and give it to you straight. Revoking his security clearance is an act unbecoming of a President. If you think it will silence John, then you just don't know the man.
1028681867858460674 2018-08-12 09:37:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today we honor the memory of Heather Heyer, whose spirit we see in every person who stands up to reject hatred and bigotry. Make no mistake: this fight goes on. The battle for the soul of this nation rests with each of us, everyday.
1026850471967944704 2018-08-07 08:20:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> Paul Laxalt was the model for something all too rare in politics today: someone with whom you could disagree without being disagreeable. We were often on opposite sides of the debate, but he was my friend. He will be missed.  https://t.co/dlVvYomwRz
1026819683729780736 2018-08-07 06:17:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> LGBTQ young people should never have to face rejection from those who love them. Share your story with @bidenfoundation about the importance of family acceptance, because we all deserve to be safe, loved, and affirmed. #AsYouAre   https://t.co/FKAz3mirQO  https://t.co/fMWz2SUoiL
1025717580793884672 2018-08-04 05:18:22 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our lunches together were a highlight of every week at the White House. Last week's trip to @DogTagBakery was no different. Happy birthday to my brother, my friend, @BarackObama.  https://t.co/0faYjvnPW6
1023198589714132993 2018-07-28 06:28:48 -0800 <JoeBiden> Honored to join @DrBiden and the remarkable men and women from @supportthewalk #WalkOfAmerica who remind us all of the debt of gratitude we owe those who have sacrificed so much to protect our freedom.
1020402341365895175 2018-07-20 13:17:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> I was honored to visit Colombia this week to engage with the country’s current and future leaders.  I wish all of my friends in Colombia a future of prosperity and peace as they celebrate the 208th anniversary of their independence.  https://t.co/ALuQDVBgsH
1018971642410819585 2018-07-16 14:32:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our president had the chance to confront an adversary who continues to attack our democracy &amp; our allies. He didn’t. Instead he offered distractions, moral equivalence, &amp; appeasement. This shameful performance doesn't represent the US or what we stand for:  https://t.co/tsc0lOV8b8
1017388656338915329 2018-07-12 05:42:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> After our video chat a few months ago, I got to welcome @shaffer_cierra to DC this week for @USMC Sunset Parade. She battled against cancer’s odds and her resilience reminds us all that hope against this disease is real. #cancerFIERCE  https://t.co/2s9LcfhdIc
1015217112141451264 2018-07-06 05:53:16 -0800 <JoeBiden> As we celebrate 242 years of freedom this week, we must never forget that democracy is not a given. Democracy demands diligence. Democracy demands engagement. And sometimes, democracy demands sacrifice of its citizens.  https://t.co/0NelFhacoF
1014613645450448904 2018-07-04 13:55:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> Keep our eyes on the horizon - look to the future. Nothing is beyond our capacity as Americans. Happy #FourthofJuly from the Biden Family.
1012678533775228929 2018-06-29 05:45:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need more men like @terrycrews who will stand up and speak out. You’re helping change the culture, Terry. It matters. Thank you.  https://t.co/wbOsMjEBuG
1012499516682129408 2018-06-28 17:54:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Another shooting. Another night in America where a father, a wife, a friend, a neighbor won’t be coming home. We can’t accept this. It must end. Congress must act. Our hearts are with the #CapitalGazette
1012361991204327427 2018-06-28 08:48:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s up to us, America. Speak out. Rise up. Be heard. The price to be paid for putting our values at risk must be clear. Now.   And show up to vote this November—in numbers like we’ve never seen.
1012361987739869184 2018-06-28 08:48:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Advice and consent. Absent that—which we’ve always had for nominees in election years in the past—we shouldn’t move forward with hearings or a vote before the mid-term elections.
1012361985915224065 2018-06-28 08:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I wish this Senate would force a consensus choice—as we did with Justice Kennedy—it no longer has the will.
1012361983583309824 2018-06-28 08:48:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> I wish this President would engage in conversations and nominate a consensus candidate. That’s what we’ve done in the past. That’s what America needs and deserves. He won’t.
1012361981557460992 2018-06-28 08:47:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> I said a year ago we’re living through a battle for the soul of this nation. Now there can be no doubt. Roe, Obergefell, Fisher, and more—so many of our fundamental rights, freedoms, and liberties—and the rule of law—are all at risk.
1011945911797321728 2018-06-27 05:14:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> Inspired by the patients, families, clinicians, and researchers of @stjuderesearch I met earlier this month. They are making hope real. Join us and let us know about your #cancerFIERCE story.  https://t.co/YONYdf0tpY  https://t.co/WSRAI7sBRn
1011655289161076737 2018-06-26 09:59:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> We don’t need to treat migrants from Central America with cruelty to strengthen US border security. We need personal, high-level engagement from the White House to press Northern Triangle leaders for progress and support to make their home countries prosperous and secure.  https://t.co/ATrg1NXC4m
1009472212456308737 2018-06-20 09:25:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> A policy that separates young children from their parents isn’t a “deterrent”. It’s unconscionable.   A policy that traumatizes children isn’t a bargaining chip. It’s abhorrent.  https://t.co/piB3h9X0ke
1005540995243626496 2018-06-09 13:03:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> PEPFAR is one of the most successful, effective, and world-changing initiatives the United States has ever led. Now is not the time to pull back. We must finish the work we started to end the specter of AIDS. My op-ed with @bfrist.  https://t.co/nnIc0YvDoz
1005469583904530432 2018-06-09 08:20:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jamie Dimon &amp; Warren Buffett's call to end quarterly guidance is an important step toward ending our nation's culture of short-termism. America's workers &amp; investors will all be better off with a system that rewards those who build for the long-term.  https://t.co/yvtwMPWabm
1005166762596491264 2018-06-08 12:16:45 -0800 <JoeBiden> GOP all-out assault on healthcare continues. First, they want to cut funding for CHIP. Now DOJ trying to end protections for pre-existing conditions. We have to fight back.
1005153354044137472 2018-06-08 11:23:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> Putin’s Russia invaded its neighbors, violated our sovereignty by undermining elections, and attacks dissidents abroad. Yet our President wants to reward him with a seat at the table while alienating our closest democratic allies. It makes no sense.
1004491175611510784 2018-06-06 15:32:13 -0800 <JoeBiden> They may have murdered our heroes, but the dream still lives buried deep in our broken hearts. Fifty years after he was taken from us, Robert Kennedy still inspires. #RFK50
1002301656032215040 2018-05-31 14:31:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> Last year, Virginians showed up to elect leaders who believe health care is a right, not a privilege. As a result, hundreds of thousands of Virginians now have the peace of mind that comes with health insurance. Don't ever question whether your vote matters -- it does. Show up.
1001924805023723526 2018-05-30 13:34:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> Looking forward to continuing my #AmericanPromiseTour in June and discussing “Promise Me, Dad” with these inspiring individuals. More information at  https://t.co/Ce1eY5jFpY.  https://t.co/46y9zH3T47
1001116077202558982 2018-05-28 08:00:47 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our men &amp; women in uniform are the heart, the soul, and the spine of this nation. Today we remember those among them who gave their lives for our freedom. As we honor their sacrifice, we must recommit to our sacred obligation to care for &amp; support the families they left behind.
1000761840127938560 2018-05-27 08:33:10 -0800 <JoeBiden> In a moment of crisis, Jason Seaman showed incredible courage. Running directly into gunfire to save his students’ lives. What a hero.  https://t.co/hLDnEwIV0s
1000139967581114368 2018-05-25 15:22:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, the @OECD officially invited Colombia to become its 37th member.  Congratulations to President @JuanManSantos and the people of Colombia for all the hard work you’ve done to create a more prosperous and secure future for your country.
998988580885286912 2018-05-22 11:06:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> It favors the powerful over the powerless and stacks the deck even further against working people.  It's wrong.
998988578343485440 2018-05-22 11:06:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> Yesterday’s Supreme Court decision was a huge blow to workers.  It denies them the ability to take their employers to court if they're being cheated out of pay, forced to work in unsafe conditions, or sexually harrassed.
998565664100179968 2018-05-21 07:06:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, but too many LGBTQ Americans are still denied this basic right. That’s why I’m proud to announce a new inclusion initiative between @bidenfoundation and @YMCA. The work continues:  https://t.co/Qi20gM6TXp
997544359275966464 2018-05-18 11:28:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> Enough is enough is enough. Decent people have to take a stand. These are our children.
997487645625372672 2018-05-18 07:42:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> Count me in, @De11eDonne. Proud to take a stand with you and the incredible athletes of @WNBA who are partnering with organizations like @ItsOnUs to empower women and girls everywhere. Folks, join us to take a seat &amp; take a stand:  https://t.co/mZbwECptqt #WNBATakesAStand #itsonus
996887880759955456 2018-05-16 15:59:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> Guys, if you see one of your classmates trying to take advantage of a woman who did not or could not consent, you must step in. #ItsOnUs to change this culture.  https://t.co/QICr93GGBJ
996511302326652931 2018-05-15 15:03:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> Harry Reid is literally and figuratively a fighter. I’m looking forward to working with him again soon. My thoughts are with Harry, Landra, and their family as he recovers.
996460058430050304 2018-05-15 11:39:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> On behalf of the whole Biden family, I’d like to offer our thoughts and best wishes to @FLOTUS for a swift and full recovery.
996419085914296320 2018-05-15 08:56:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> Joined today @UDBidenInst by one of the most brilliant public servants I’ve ever worked with: @ErnestMoniz. By investing in basic infrastructure, we have a tremendous opportunity to lead the world in clean energy. Watch our discussion here at 12pm:  https://t.co/WEc43AFGaG
995327503744032773 2018-05-12 08:39:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> Free and fair elections are at the heart of liberal democracy. That’s why I’ve joined @AndersFoghr and Michael Chertoff to launch the Transatlantic Commission for Election Integrity—to fight back against Russia and those who would meddle in our elections.  https://t.co/t8DI6sESnv
993957007337148417 2018-05-08 13:53:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today’s announcement that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal is a profound mistake.   https://t.co/Odx33rBf3V
989268867007614976 2018-04-25 15:24:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every person is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. But far too often LGBTQ youth in this country are not, even in their own homes. This is unacceptable. I’m proud to work with @cyndilauper on #TrueColorsDay and everyday to put it to an end.  https://t.co/8naun6addt
987329310892716036 2018-04-20 06:57:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> Cancer patients and their families deserve a system that puts saving lives above every other thing. With your help, we can make this happen. We can make hope real. We need you to stand up and join us in this effort. Answer the @bidencancer call to action:  https://t.co/h1d9bRD757
987061429994967052 2018-04-19 13:12:38 -0800 <JoeBiden> Testing rape kits should &amp; must be a national priority. I’m proud to have been interviewed for @Mariska’s @IAMEVIDENCEmov. We should all be committed to #EndTheBacklog. Let’s keep the pressure on:  https://t.co/qaOmoHHNHH
986430676269486080 2018-04-17 19:26:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> There was no one else quite like Barbara Bush. Jill and I — and the entire Biden family — send our heartfelt condolences to the Bush family and our prayers for comfort in a difficult time.   https://t.co/PQrgGL4Jpd
985607921026420736 2018-04-15 12:56:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> Five years after an act of hate struck Boston, the thousands of acts of charity and compassion on #OneBostonDay remind us once again that America will always own the finish line. Proud of you, Boston - today and always.
981990403590316037 2018-04-05 13:22:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> The United States should be leading on this issue. Improving transparency is one essential step to ending the pay gap between men and women.  https://t.co/c6MudXo3lv
981539101093564416 2018-04-04 07:28:52 -0800 <JoeBiden> Dr. King was proof that the promise of America can beat so strongly in the heart of one person they can move this nation. We can all -- 300 plus million Americans -- honor Dr. King’s legacy by remembering that today. #MLK50
980924325112041473 2018-04-02 14:45:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> I’m grateful to have the opportunity to continue the #AmericanPromiseTour in June and hear from so many more people. Information available at  https://t.co/iVmA0l5d29.  https://t.co/6VrcwHtiqM
978825148882149377 2018-03-27 19:44:35 -0800 <JoeBiden> Cierra, you remembered the most important thing I had to say. You will beat this.  And as I’ve always said, if there are any angels in heaven, they are nurses. You’ve got a great team of them there making sure you stay #cierrastrong.  https://t.co/6q8DPaBpXF
978353418082422785 2018-03-26 12:30:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> My mother often reminded me that “bravery resides in every heart and some day it will be summoned.” Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame answered the call last Friday in France. Taking the place of a hostage and paying the ultimate price. His heroism and self-sacrifice must not be forgotten.
976950125607247872 2018-03-22 15:33:55 -0800 <JoeBiden> At @UDBidenInst, we’re working on the pressing domestic policy challenges of our time. But we can't do it alone. I sat down earlier with our new Policy Board to discuss everything from quality jobs to climate change. Check out the whole team here:  https://t.co/m217SzXK8L
976792123285569536 2018-03-22 05:06:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our top priority should be investing in our workers by 1. ensuring they have the skills &amp; opportunities to get a good job, 2. making work pay, and 3. cutting the costs of raising a family.   Read my thoughts on how we can all help our workers succeed:  https://t.co/LskwT40rA3
976054381090091008 2018-03-20 04:14:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let’s give patients full electronic medical records within 24 hours of request, a safe place to store them, and a trusted way to share them. Details matter when using patient data to save and improve lives.   My @BidenCancer op-ed:  https://t.co/scNifu2zjS
974728763912146946 2018-03-16 12:27:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> Louise Slaughter was an unparalleled champion for women. I worked with her on the Violence Against Women Act, and I will always remember her grit and determination in standing up for women and families every day. She will be greatly missed.
973928846578933761 2018-03-14 07:28:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> The people of Pennsylvania’s 18th district showed up yesterday. They demonstrated that they want to be represented by someone who stands up for working people with actions, not just words. Who has heart. They found that in @ConorLambPA. He will represent them well.
973341874047148032 2018-03-12 16:36:01 -0800 <JoeBiden> I was in southwestern Pennsylvania with @ConorLambPA last week. Something's changing out there. You can feel the grassroots energy. And that'll beat big money every time. Let's bring this one home. Get out and vote, Pennsylvania.  https://t.co/Rl9EO2Ok5d
971811298408325120 2018-03-08 10:14:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> Everyone does better when women are able to rise as high as their talents will take them.  On this International Women’s Day, we honor all the brave women who have spoken out this year, and we recognize that our fight is still far from finished.  https://t.co/eHGDZCiNUJ #IWD2018
971394160468090880 2018-03-07 06:36:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Sarah, I'm incredibly proud of you. You're a woman of real courage.  https://t.co/kQlQdGWlbt
968937201416491008 2018-02-28 11:53:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> It takes courage to speak out against sexual assault, or to step in to stop it from happening.   If you know someone who has stepped up to the front lines of this fight, I want to hear about it.  Nominate them today, because #ItsOnUs to change the culture:  https://t.co/BWR83Bx5FX
968213300956880897 2018-02-26 11:56:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need to give young immigrants who came to our country as children permanent assurance that they are safe here, and we need to give them this peace of mind now. They shouldn’t have to spend another day living with fear and uncertainty.
967066282305703936 2018-02-23 07:59:03 -0800 <JoeBiden> When I wrote the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, it included a provision that empowered women to take abusers to civil court. The Supreme Court wrongly struck it down. Now it is time for Congress to step up and fix this.  https://t.co/bzgD80sULc
966658832150745089 2018-02-22 04:59:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> Rev. Graham was spiritual advisor to a dozen Presidents - and countless millions of Americans. We remember his example of dignity and humility today, and Jill and I send our thoughts and condolences to the entire Graham family.
964135454353354752 2018-02-15 05:52:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> I am at a loss for what more to say. I grieve with the families in Parkland today. I grieve with the families across the country who have suffered loss due to gun violence. Congress has a moral obligation to take action and spare more families from this violence.
963755815856459776 2018-02-14 04:44:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> We need to believe women like Colbie. We need to recognize the incredible courage it takes for women like her to come forward. And we need to change the culture so those who live in fear can safely get the support they deserve.  https://t.co/aIE49mOU0K
963566562157514752 2018-02-13 16:12:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> We had the honor of having Jesmyn Ward moderate the 30th event on the #AmericanPromiseTour last night. It was wonderful to share the stage with such an incredible and acclaimed writer to discuss #PromiseMeDad.  https://t.co/Nw3HqiTWyg

961975243983245312 2018-02-09 06:49:05 -0800 <JoeBiden> William Gay is the real deal - on and off the field. He’s using his voice to get other men involved to end sexual assault and domestic violence. He understands what this fight is all about. I’m glad to have you on the @BidenFoundation team @Southcity22.  https://t.co/QbF4Ryf17I
961757689918390272 2018-02-08 16:24:36 -0800 <JoeBiden> Incredible day opening the new @PennBiden Center in Washington. We're working on the foreign policy challenges of this new century and keeping America strong in the world. Looking forward to working with Dr. Gutmann and the @Penn community to engage a new generation of leaders.  https://t.co/NyjGW0ysDV
960368920367640577 2018-02-04 20:26:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> This team never gave up. No matter the injuries, no matter the odds. They showed incredible heart. What a great win tonight, @Eagles. #FlyEaglesFly
958553443429478400 2018-01-30 20:12:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> Proud to call you a friend, @RepJoeKennedy. You captured the idealism and optimism of our party — and this nation. Because you understand that everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity. And that in this country, no one gets left behind. Well done.
955600252148600832 2018-01-22 16:37:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> This country has made great progress in changing the culture around advancing LGBTQ equality and ending violence against women. But there's plenty of work left to do. I'm pleased to have some of the best and brightest minds on these issues working with us.  https://t.co/ADHtIBPll0
953027386974638080 2018-01-15 14:13:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Dr. King said that change “comes through continuous struggle.” As we celebrate his legacy today, we’re once again living through a battle for the soul of this nation. We'll win this battle by following his example: standing up, getting involved, and demanding our voices be heard.
951844048159068160 2018-01-12 07:51:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s not how a president should speak. It’s not how a president should behave. Most of all, it’s not what a president should believe. We’re better than this.
947877562629414912 2018-01-01 09:09:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> Boston has had many great mayors in its remarkable history, and @marty_walsh can proudly take his place among any of them. Thank you, Mayor, for giving me the honor of presiding over your swearing-in today.  https://t.co/wiK3t5u8wX

941458866516217858 2017-12-14 16:04:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s been five years since 20 first-graders and 6 educators were murdered by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Their families continue to inspire me with their courage in turning tragedy into purpose.  https://t.co/RSOU6d7dXI
941082555150995456 2017-12-13 15:09:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Ann Arbor - I’m terribly sorry I won’t get to see you this evening, but we want to make sure everyone can safely make it to #AmericanPromiseTour. Be safe in the snow. I’m looking forward to seeing you on February 5th.

940788655219728386 2017-12-12 19:41:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> Doug Jones. Thank you, Alabama. You’ve elected a man of incredible integrity, grit, and character. A fighter for working class and middle class Alabamians. He is going to make you proud in the Senate.
940326781688664074 2017-12-11 13:05:49 -0800 <JoeBiden> Tomorrow, the people of Alabama will decide whether the United States Senate will gain the courage, character, and integrity of Doug Jones. Find your friends who can vote there, and make sure they're planning on doing it.    https://t.co/JTf5VPJCpu
940293261180186624 2017-12-11 10:52:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> The people of California are on my mind as they suffer through these devastating wildfires. Amidst the loss, I’m inspired by the bravery &amp; commitment of our firefighters. Day after day going back into the flames, risking their lives to save others. Incredible bravery.
940030138556674048 2017-12-10 17:27:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s a little too cold for ice cream in Madison, but I hope you liked the cupcakes all the same. Thanks for spending your birthday with me, @ElaineWelteroth - hope this next year is a great one. #AmericanPromiseTour  https://t.co/qj0d6xbz8n
938533561770106880 2017-12-06 14:20:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> Be who you are. Stand for what you are. Few people embody that better than @melindagates.

927342840593768449 2017-11-05 17:12:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> These tragedies aren’t inevitable. Don’t let hopelessness win today. We must persist in our efforts to prevent gun violence.
927342624872239104 2017-11-05 17:11:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> Americans again murdered in a place of worship. Jill and I send our prayers to Sutherland Springs.

918896418559053825 2017-10-13 10:49:13 -0800 <JoeBiden> Unilaterally putting the Iran deal at risk does not isolate Iran. It isolates us:  https://t.co/Cj1zu126bb

914867985558491136 2017-10-02 08:01:39 -0800 <JoeBiden> How long do we let gun violence tear families apart? Enough. Congress &amp; the WH should act now to save lives. There's no excuse for inaction.
914867837201764358 2017-10-02 08:01:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> Appalled by the senseless loss of life in Las Vegas. Jill and I hold all those affected and grieving in our hearts.

911334191803101184 2017-09-22 13:59:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today's Title IX decision is shameful, but the law is still the law. Colleges &amp; universities must honor obligations to students &amp; survivors.

909938968250200067 2017-09-18 17:35:30 -0800 <JoeBiden> Just had the chance to see President Trump's golf swing tweet. Enough. This has to stop. Our children are watching.
909755960826228737 2017-09-18 05:28:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> Here's a path forward to choose a future that puts work first:  https://t.co/Y6B2q21nHF

908414942751150080 2017-09-14 12:39:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> America is strongest when we lead with our values—at home and abroad.  https://t.co/g8vGlXdeqz
908081316922568704 2017-09-13 14:33:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> 23 years ago today, the Violence Against Women Act became law. VAWA is changing the culture &amp; saving lives, but our work continues. #VAWA23
907237711295238145 2017-09-11 06:41:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> 16 years ago today, terror tried to break us. It did not, and will never, succeed. Our grit &amp; determination are the strongest force I know.
906697794467057668 2017-09-09 18:56:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I are praying for the safety of everyone in the path of Hurricane Irma this weekend. Stay strong - the country stands with you.
905877262813335552 2017-09-07 12:35:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> Any change that weakens Title IX protections will be devastating:  https://t.co/8E3n3RIMTS
905110522512764930 2017-09-05 09:48:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> Brought by parents, these children had no choice in coming here. Now they'll be sent to countries they've never known. Cruel. Not America.
901876067555790850 2017-08-27 11:36:25 -0800 <JoeBiden> We are living through a battle for the soul of this nation.  https://t.co/2XtpeyhVex

898332043620237312 2017-08-17 16:53:44 -0800 <JoeBiden> Praying tonight for the victims of #Barcelona attack &amp; their families. Heinous acts of terror cannot break the spirit of our Spanish friends
896496130497929220 2017-08-12 15:18:28 -0800 <JoeBiden> There is only one side. #charlottesville
896456601401524226 2017-08-12 12:41:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> No. Not in America. We must be stronger, more determined and more united than ever. Racism and hate have no place here. #charlottesville
893478138822479872 2017-08-04 07:26:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> Your service has been a great gift to the country, and your friendship and brotherhood are a great gift to me. Happy birthday, @BarackObama.  https://t.co/1uSEkU01k9
892130294572167169 2017-07-31 14:10:11 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thrilled to see the 2028 Olympics coming to Los Angeles. Thanks to @MayorOfLA Garcetti who worked hard to secure a big win for US athletics.
890983396746313728 2017-07-28 10:12:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> Hope to see you at a stop this fall on my #AmericanPromiseTour – tickets are available now:  https://t.co/Y7IzxK9m5l  https://t.co/LnW8Ob2ah8
890965572552466438 2017-07-28 09:02:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Thank you to everyone who tirelessly worked to protect the health care of millions. You saved lives.
890276418537607168 2017-07-26 11:23:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> To all of you working to stop Republicans’ devastating “health” bill: Thank you. We’re not done yet. Please keep going.
890276320231510017 2017-07-26 11:23:09 -0800 <JoeBiden> Any final bill that looks anything like their proposals so far would be devastating.
890218086909063169 2017-07-26 07:31:46 -0800 <JoeBiden> Every patriotic American who is qualified to serve in our military should be able to serve. Full stop.
889578666023411712 2017-07-24 13:10:56 -0800 <JoeBiden> The GOP's "health" plan would gut care &amp; treatment for opioid addiction. Call your senators—the time to act is now.  https://t.co/ZHX7KZLgXk
887857097982959617 2017-07-19 19:10:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> Incredible progress in cancer research and treatment in just the last year offers new promise and new hope. You can win this fight, John.
887844137034293248 2017-07-19 18:18:32 -0800 <JoeBiden> John and I have been friends for 40 years. He's gotten through so much difficulty with so much grace. He is strong - and he will beat this.
887077574899380224 2017-07-17 15:32:29 -0800 <JoeBiden> @washingtonpost I was a senator for 36 years. I can assure you that your call matters. Your viewpoint might not always win, but your senators hear you.
887077501415174148 2017-07-17 15:32:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> @washingtonpost Especially if you live in WV, NV, AK or OH now is the time to call your senators. Or, encourage your friends in these states to call.
887077368791277569 2017-07-17 15:31:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> @washingtonpost If you believe health care is a right for all, make sure your senators know that this bill is a big step backward.
887077257914851328 2017-07-17 15:31:14 -0800 <JoeBiden> @washingtonpost All Americans deserve the peace of mind that comes with knowing that you can get affordable care. But that’s now under threat.
887077048652632064 2017-07-17 15:30:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> @washingtonpost By denying this right, Republican leadership’s “health” bill is fundamentally flawed. It can’t even be fixed on the floor.
887076943383994369 2017-07-17 15:29:59 -0800 <JoeBiden> @washingtonpost Republican leadership's “health” bill would return us to a time when health care was a privilege for the wealthy, not a right for all.
887076804795781121 2017-07-17 15:29:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> Today, I wrote in the @washingtonpost about the big problem with the Republican leadership’s "health" bill:  https://t.co/GYCeXPhWdX
886929971859640320 2017-07-17 05:45:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> Excited to share news about #AmericanPromiseTour - a series of conversations I’m hosting around the country  https://t.co/Y7IzxKqXtV  https://t.co/lpVu14LZsZ
884844212805668864 2017-07-11 11:37:54 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill &amp; I send our condolences to the loved ones of service members lost in MS crash—those who wear the uniform are the heart of our nation.
882304779195736064 2017-07-04 11:27:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> Happy 4th of July! America continues the march toward tolerance, diversity and equality of opportunity that began in 1776—that's patriotism.
879409223754555399 2017-06-26 11:41:12 -0800 <JoeBiden> We’re live in a few minutes to talk about how @BidenCancer will bring renewed urgency to the fight against cancer:  https://t.co/1rcV1XdLmS
879394318171156482 2017-06-26 10:41:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I are excited and ready to take the next step toward ending cancer. Are you with us?  https://t.co/vVDk81oRtq
878379136590299136 2017-06-23 15:28:00 -0800 <JoeBiden> Let's see a bill that actually tries to improve folks' health care, and then we can have a reasonable debate about how to best do that.
878379025634390016 2017-06-23 15:27:33 -0800 <JoeBiden> Especially now, when so many communities are struggling with opioid addiction, the bill's drastic cuts to Medicaid are cruel.
878378777549471744 2017-06-23 15:26:34 -0800 <JoeBiden> Slashing Medicaid hurts kids, the elderly, people with disabilities and those struggling with addiction. All for tax breaks for the wealthy.
878378606464036865 2017-06-23 15:25:53 -0800 <JoeBiden> The Senate health bill isn't about health care at all—it's a wealth transfer: slashes care to fund tax cuts for the wealthy &amp; corporations.
877255555244597248 2017-06-20 13:03:17 -0800 <JoeBiden> America’s soul is rooted in the promise of opportunity. We must protect, support &amp; welcome refugees to keep that promise. #WorldRefugeeDay  https://t.co/4K3exquxgl
876301689632034816 2017-06-17 21:52:58 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I are praying for the people of Colombia and the families of the victims of tonight's bomb explosion. #BogotaEstoyContigo

875043119213023235 2017-06-14 10:31:51 -0800 <JoeBiden> Jill and I are praying for the victims and their families. Grateful for courage of my former colleagues, first responders &amp; Capitol Police.
874353636364738560 2017-06-12 12:52:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> We meet unspeakable tragedy and hate with unbound resolve. I stand with the LGBTQ community, today and every day. #OrlandoUnitedDay.  https://t.co/9lvBiV8q1k
872507057747877889 2017-06-07 10:34:27 -0800 <JoeBiden> Honored to see Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew in Athens – his leadership on climate change and the environment is the example we need now  https://t.co/VO2zdVc3Gc
872445131080646656 2017-06-07 06:28:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> Great to be with @PennBiden in Athens. A Europe whole, free, &amp; at peace remains vital to U.S. security–as it has been for the past 7 decades
871154315502784512 2017-06-03 16:59:08 -0800 <JoeBiden> Congrats to Ambassador Andy Young, a dear friend and inspiration, on 85 years. Wish I could be in Atlanta tonight for AJY Leadership Awards.
870374738597564416 2017-06-01 13:21:23 -0800 <JoeBiden> We're already feeling impacts of climate change. Exiting #ParisAgreement imperils US security and our ability to own the clean energy future
870285583838584832 2017-06-01 07:27:06 -0800 <JoeBiden> It's time for big dreams and #AmericanPossibilities. If you're ready to elect folks who agree, say you're in:  https://t.co/HyJR0b0KxA  https://t.co/nmvlgZfKYN
870284285282062337 2017-06-01 07:21:57 -0800 <JoeBiden> There’s no one better positioned on Earth to lead the world in the 21st century than America. We just have to believe it.
870283967454466049 2017-06-01 07:20:41 -0800 <JoeBiden> America is at its best when we’re OPTIMISTIC and we THINK BIG.
870283709903233026 2017-06-01 07:19:40 -0800 <JoeBiden> It’s time to remember who we are as Americans: Giving EVERYONE the opportunity to achieve the impossible.
870283447511769090 2017-06-01 07:18:37 -0800 <JoeBiden> Our politics has become too small and petty. We’re better than this.
870283056443162624 2017-06-01 07:17:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> America has always thought BIG. It’s stamped into our DNA.
870039020415352836 2017-05-31 15:07:21 -0800 <JoeBiden> Climate change is an existential threat to our future—staying in #ParisAgreement is the best way to protect our children &amp; global leadership
869299920129359872 2017-05-29 14:10:26 -0800 <JoeBiden> To our nation's fallen troops: we thank you and will never forget. To their families: remember, you are never alone.
868553216698482692 2017-05-27 12:43:18 -0800 <JoeBiden> Zbigniew Brzezinski's brilliant strategic mind enriched American foreign policy for decades--his distinctive voice will be greatly missed.
867730227543158784 2017-05-25 06:13:02 -0800 <JoeBiden> Great to see Mayor @marty_walsh, and hear about everything he's doing to keep Boston strong.  https://t.co/U74RGLciBb
864879534096629760 2017-05-17 09:25:24 -0800 <JoeBiden> LGBT rights are human rights. Prejudice is prejudice; inhumanity is inhumanity.  #IDAHOT #IDAHOT2017  https://t.co/XyAWDqAtAJ
862041297451835393 2017-05-09 13:27:15 -0800 <JoeBiden> To the teacher who inspires me every day, and all the other amazing teachers changing lives, Happy #NationalTeachersDay!  https://t.co/cismp3x67d
860252829184806912 2017-05-04 15:00:31 -0800 <JoeBiden> Millions of Americans will lose coverage. Up to the Senate now. Hoping for courage to return.
860252753217568768 2017-05-04 15:00:13 -0800 <JoeBiden> Day of shame in Congress. Protections for pre-existing conditions, mental health, maternity care, addiction services -- all gone.
854351075322626049 2017-04-18 08:09:04 -0800 <JoeBiden> Dan Rooney embodied everything I was raised to believe being Irish meant – generosity, decency, warmth, dignity &amp; a truly genuine spirit.
853268886824902656 2017-04-15 08:28:50 -0800 <JoeBiden> Boston represents what it means to never yield, never cower, never stand down &amp; lead the way. America owns the finish line. #OneBostonDay
852956955152797696 2017-04-14 11:49:19 -0800 <JoeBiden> When faced with crimes of hate and inhumanity, every person of conscience must speak out in support of #LGBT rights  https://t.co/crzQTFQKmS

847474077858123780 2017-03-30 08:42:20 -0800 <JoeBiden> I am confident America is better positioned than any other nation in the world to lead in the 21st century.
